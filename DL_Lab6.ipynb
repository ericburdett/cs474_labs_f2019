It was begun soon after The Hobbit was written and before \\nits publication in 1937; but I did not go on with this sequel, for I wished \\nfirst to complete and set in order the mythology and legends of the Elder \\nDays, which had then been taking shape for some years. I desired to do this \\nfor my own satisfaction, and I had little hope that other people would be \\ninterested in this work, especially since it was primarily linguistic in \\ninspiration and was begun in order to provide the necessary background of \\n\\'history\\' for Elvish tongues. \\n\\nWhen those whose advice and opinion I sought corrected little hope to \\nno hope, I went back to the sequel, encouraged by requests from readers for \\nmore information concerning hobbits and their adventures. But the story was \\ndrawn irresistibly towards the older world, and became an account, as it \\nwere, of its end and passing away before its beginning and middle had been \\ntold. The process had begun in the writing of The Hobbit, in which there \\nwere already some references to the older matter: Elrond, Gondolin, the \\nHigh-elves, and the ores, as well as glimpses that had arisen unbidden of \\nthings higher or deeper or darker than its surface: Durin, Moria, Gandalf, \\nthe Necromancer, the Ring. The discovery of the significance of these \\nglimpses and of their relation to the ancient histories revealed the Third \\nAge and its culmination in the War of the Ring. \\n\\nThose who had asked for more information about hobbits eventually got \\nit, but they had to wait a long time; for the composition of The Lord of the \\nRings went on at intervals during the years 1936 to 1949, a period in which \\nI had many duties that I did not neglect, and many other interests as a \\nlearner and teacher that often absorbed me. The delay was, of course, also \\nincreased by the outbreak of war in 1939, by the end of which year the tale \\nhad not yet reached the end of Book One. In spite of the darkness of the \\nnext five years I found that the story could not now be wholly abandoned, \\nand I plodded on, mostly by night, till I stood by Balin\\'s tomb in Moria. \\nThere I halted for a long while. It was almost a year later when I went on \\nand so came to Lothlurien and the Great River late in 1941. In the next year \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI wrote the first drafts of the matter that now stands as Book Three, and \\nthe beginnings of chapters I and III of Book Five; and there as the beacons \\nflared in Anurien and Thjoden came to Harrowdale I stopped. Foresight had \\nfailed and there was no time for thought. \\n\\nIt was during 1944 that, leaving the loose ends and perplexities of a \\nwar which it was my task to conduct, or at least to report, 1 forced myself \\nto tackle the journey of Frodo to Mordor. These chapters, eventually to \\nbecome Book Four, were written and sent out as a serial to my son, \\nChristopher, then in South Africa with the RAF. Nonetheless it took another \\nfive years before the tale was brought to its present end; in that time I \\nchanged my house, my chair, and my college, and the days though less dark \\nwere no less laborious. Then when the \\'end\\' had at last been reached the \\nwhole story had to be revised, and indeed largely re-written backwards. And \\nit had to be typed, and re-typed: by me; the cost of professional typing by \\nthe ten-fingered was beyond my means. \\n\\nThe Lord of the Rings has been read by many people since it finally \\nappeared in print; and I should like to say something here with reference to \\nthe many opinions or guesses that I have received or have read concerning \\nthe motives and meaning of the tale. The prime motive was the desire of a \\ntale-teller to try his hand at a really long story that would hold the \\nattention of readers, amuse them, delight them, and at times maybe excite \\nthem or deeply move them. As a guide I had only my own feelings for what is \\nappealing or moving, and for many the guide was inevitably often at fault. \\nSome who have read the book, or at any rate have reviewed it, have found it \\nboring, absurd, or contemptible; and I have no cause to complain, since I \\nhave similar opinions of their works, or of the kinds of writing that they \\nevidently prefer. But even from the points of view of many who have enjoyed \\nmy story there is much that fails to please. It is perhaps not possible in a \\nlong tale to please everybody at all points, nor to displease everybody at \\nthe same points; for I find from the letters that I have received that the \\npassages or chapters that are to some a blemish are all by others specially \\napproved. The most critical reader of all, myself, now finds many defects, \\nminor and major, but being fortunately under no obligation either to review \\nthe book or to write it again, he will pass over these in silence, except \\none that has been noted by others: the book is too short. \\n\\nAs for any inner meaning or \\'message\\', it has in the intention of the \\nauthor none. It is neither allegorical nor topical. As the story grew it put \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndown roots (into the past) and threw out unexpected branches: but its main \\ntheme was settled from the outset by the inevitable choice of the Ring as \\nthe link between it and The Hobbit. The crucial chapter, \"The Shadow of the \\nPast\\', is one of the oldest parts of the tale. It was written long before \\nthe foreshadow of 1939 had yet become a threat of inevitable disaster, and \\nfrom that point the story would have developed along essentially the same \\nlines, if that disaster had been averted. Its sources are things long before \\nin mind, or in some cases already written, and little or nothing in it was \\nmodified by the war that began in 1939 or its sequels. \\n\\nThe real war does not resemble the legendary war in its process or its \\nconclusion. If it had inspired or directed the development of the legend, \\nthen certainly the Ring would have been seized and used against Sauron; he \\nwould not have been annihilated but enslaved, and Barad-dyr would not have \\nbeen destroyed but occupied. Saruman, failing to get possession of the Ring, \\nwould m the confusion and treacheries of the time have found in Mordor the \\nmissing links in his own researches into Ring-lore, and before long he would \\nhave made a Great Ring of his own with which to challenge the self-styled \\nRuler of Middle-earth. In that conflict both sides would have held hobbits \\nin hatred and contempt: they would not long have survived even as slaves. \\n\\nOther arrangements could be devised according to the tastes or views of \\nthose who like allegory or topical reference. But I cordially dislike \\nallegory in all its manifestations, and always have done so since I grew old \\nand wary enough to detect its presence. I much prefer history, true or \\nfeigned, with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of \\nreaders. I think that many confuse \\'applicability\\' with \\'allegory\\'; but the \\none resides in the freedom of the reader, and the other in the purposed \\ndomination of the author. \\n\\nAn author cannot of course remain wholly unaffected by his experience, \\nbut the ways in which a story-germ uses the soil of experience are extremely \\ncomplex, and attempts to define the process are at best guesses from \\nevidence that is inadequate and ambiguous. It is also false, though \\nnaturally attractive, when the lives of an author and critic have \\noverlapped, to suppose that the movements of thought or the events of times \\ncommon to both were necessarily the most powerful influences. One has \\nindeed \\n\\npersonally to come under the shadow of war to feel fully its oppression; but \\nas the years go by it seems now often forgotten that to be caught in youth \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nby 1914 was no less hideous an experience than to be involved in 1939 and \\nthe following years. By 1918 all but one of my close friends were dead. Or \\nto take a less grievous matter: it has been supposed by some that The \\nScouring of the Shire\\' reflects the situation in England at the time when I \\nwas finishing my tale. It does not. It is an essential part of the plot, \\nforeseen from the outset, though in the event modified by the character of \\nSaruman as developed in the story without, need I say, any allegorical \\nsignificance or contemporary political reference whatsoever. It has indeed \\nsome basis in experience, though slender (for the economic situation was \\nentirely different), and much further back. The country in which I lived in \\nchildhood was being shabbily destroyed before I was ten, in days when \\nmotor-cars were rare objects (I had never seen one) and men were still \\nbuilding suburban railways. Recently I saw in a paper a picture of the last \\ndecrepitude of the once thriving corn-mill beside its pool that long ago \\nseemed to me so important. I never liked the looks of the Young miller, but \\nhis father, the Old miller, had a black beard, and he was not named \\nSandy man. \\n\\nThe Lord of the Rings is now issued in a new edition, and the \\nopportunity has been taken of revising it. A number of errors and \\ninconsistencies that still remained in the text have been corrected, and an \\nattempt has been made to provide information on a few points which attentive \\nreaders have raised. I have considered all their comments and enquiries, and \\nif some seem to have been passed over that may be because I have failed to \\nkeep my notes in order; but many enquiries could only be answered by \\nadditional appendices, or indeed by the production of an accessory volume \\ncontaining much of the material that I did not include in the original \\nedition, in particular more detailed linguistic information. In the meantime \\nthis edition offers this Foreword, an addition to the Prologue, some notes, \\nand an index of the names of persons and places. This index is in intention \\ncomplete in items but not in references, since for the present purpose it \\nhas been necessary to reduce its bulk. A complete index, making full use of \\nthe material prepared for me by Mrs. N. Smith, belongs rather to the \\naccessory volume. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* PROLOGUE * \\n\\n\\n\\n1. Concerning Hobbits \\n\\n\\n\\nThis book is largely concerned with Hobbits, and from its pages a \\nreader may discover much of their character and a little of their history. \\nFurther information will also be found in the selection from the Red Book of \\nWestmarch that has already been published, under the title of The Hobbit. \\nThat story was derived from the earlier chapters of the Red Book, composed \\nby Bilbo himself, the first Hobbit to become famous in the world at large, \\nand called by him There and Back Again, since they told of his journey into \\nthe East and his return: an adventure which later involved all the Hobbits \\nin the great events of that Age that are here related. \\n\\nMany, however, may wish to know more about this remarkable people \\nfrom \\n\\nthe outset, while some may not possess the earlier book. For such readers a \\nfew notes on the more important points are here collected from Hobbit-lore, \\nand the first adventure is briefly recalled. \\n\\nHobbits are an unobtrusive but very ancient people, more numerous \\nformerly than they are today; for they love peace and quiet and good tilled \\nearth: a well-ordered and well-farmed countryside was their favourite haunt. \\nThey do not and did not understand or like machines more complicated than a \\nforge -bellows, a water-mill, or a hand-loom, though they were skilful with \\ntools. Even in ancient days they were, as a rule, shy of \\'the Big Folk\\', as \\nthey call us, and now they avoid us with dismay and are becoming hard to \\nfind. They are quick of hearing and sharp-eyed, and though they are inclined \\nto be fat and do not hurry unnecessarily, they are nonetheless nimble and \\ndeft in their movements. They possessed from the first the art of \\ndisappearing swiftly and silently, when large folk whom they do not wish to \\nmeet come blundering by; and this an they have developed until to Men it may \\nseem magical. But Hobbits have never, in fact, studied magic of any kind, \\nand their elusiveness is due solely to a professional skill that heredity \\nand practice, and a close friendship with the earth, have rendered \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ninimitable by bigger and clumsier races. \\n\\nFor they are a little people, smaller than Dwarves: less tout and \\nstocky, that is, even when they are not actually much shorter. Their height \\nis variable, ranging between two and four feet of our measure. They seldom \\nnow reach three feet; but they hive dwindled, they say, and in ancient days \\nthey were taller. According to the Red Book, Bandobras Took (Bullroarer), \\nson of Isengrim the Second, was four foot five and able to ride a horse. He \\nwas surpassed in all Hobbit records only by two famous characters of old; \\nbut that curious matter is dealt with in this book. \\n\\nAs for the Hobbits of the Shire, with whom these tales are concerned, \\nin the days of their peace and prosperity they were a merry folk. They \\ndressed in bright colours, being notably fond of yellow and green; but they \\nseldom wore shoes, since their feet had tough leathery soles and were clad \\nin a thick curling hair, much like the hair of their heads, which was \\ncommonly brown. Thus, the only craft little practised among them was \\nshoe-making; but they had long and skilful fingers and could make many other \\nuseful and comely things. Their faces were as a rule good-natured rather \\nthan beautiful, broad, bright-eyed, red-cheeked, with mouths apt to \\nlaughter, and to eating and drinking. And laugh they did, and eat, and \\ndrink, often and heartily, being fond of simple jests at all times, and of \\nsix meals a day (when they could get them). They were hospitable and \\ndelighted in parties, and in presents, which they gave away freely and \\neagerly accepted. \\n\\nIt is plain indeed that in spite of later estrangement Hobbits are \\nrelatives of ours: far nearer to us than Elves, or even than Dwarves. Of old \\nthey spoke the languages of Men, after their own fashion, and liked and \\ndisliked much the same things as Men did. But what exactly our relationship \\nis can no longer be discovered. The beginning of Hobbits lies far back in \\nthe Elder Days that are now lost and forgotten. Only the Elves still \\npreserve any records of that vanished time, and their traditions are \\nconcerned almost entirely with their own history, in which Men appear seldom \\nand Hobbits are not mentioned at all. Yet it is clear that Hobbits had, in \\nfact, lived quietly in Middle-earth for many long years before other folk \\nbecame even aware of them. And the world being after all full of strange \\ncreatures beyond count, these little people seemed of very little \\nimportance. But in the days of Bilbo, and of Frodo his heir, they suddenly \\nbecame, by no wish of their own, both important and renowned, and troubled \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe counsels of the Wise and the Great. \\n\\nThose days, the Third Age of Middle -earth, are now long past, and the \\nshape of all lands has been changed; but the regions in which Hobbits then \\nlived were doubtless the same as those in which they still linger: the \\nNorth-West of the Old World, east of the Sea. Of their original home the \\nHobbits in Bilbo\\'s time preserved no knowledge. A love of learning (other \\nthan genealogical lore) was far from general among them, but there remained \\nstill a few in the older families who studied their own books, and even \\ngathered reports of old times and distant lands from Elves, Dwarves, and \\nMen. Their own records began only after the settlement of the Shire, and \\ntheir most ancient legends hardly looked further back than their Wandering \\nDays. It is clear, nonetheless, from these legends, and from the evidence of \\ntheir peculiar words and customs, that like many other folk Hobbits had in \\nthe distant past moved westward. Their earliest tales seem to glimpse a time \\nwhen they dwelt in the upper vales of Anduin, between the eaves of \\nGreenwood \\n\\nthe Great and the Misty Mountains. Why they later undertook the hard and \\nperilous crossing of the mountains into Eriador is no longer certain. Their \\nown accounts speak of the multiplying of Men in the land, and of a shadow \\nthat fell on the forest, so that it became darkened and its new name was \\nMirkwood. \\n\\nBefore the crossing of the mountains the Hobbits had already become \\ndivided into three somewhat different breeds: Harfoots, Stoors, and \\nFallohides. The Harfoots were browner of skin, smaller, and shorter, and \\nthey were beardless and bootless; their hands and feet were neat and nimble; \\nand they preferred highlands and hillsides. The Stoors were broader, heavier \\nin build; their feet and hands were larger, and they preferred flat lands \\nand riversides. The Fallohides were fairer of skin and also of hair, and \\nthey were taller and slimmer than the others; they were lovers of trees and \\nof woodlands. \\n\\nThe Harfoots had much to do with Dwarves in ancient times, and long \\nlived in the foothills of the mountains. They moved westward early, and \\nroamed over Eriador as far as Weathertop while the others were still in the \\nWilderland. They were the most normal and representative variety of Hobbit, \\nand far the most numerous. They were the most inclined to settle in one \\nplace, and longest preserved their ancestral habit of living in tunnels and \\nholes. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Stoors lingered long by the banks of the Great River Anduin, and \\nwere less shy of Men. They came west after the Harfoots and followed the \\ncourse of the Loudwater southwards; and there many of them long dwelt \\nbetween Tharbad and the borders of Dunland before they moved north again. \\n\\nThe Fallohides, the least numerous, were a northerly branch. They were \\nmore friendly with Elves than the other Hobbits were, and had more skill in \\nlanguage and song than in handicrafts; and of old they preferred hunting to \\ntilling. They crossed the mountains north of Rivendell and came down the \\nRiver Hoarwell. In Eriador they soon mingled with the other kinds that had \\npreceded them, but being somewhat bolder and more adventurous, they were \\noften found as leaders or chieftains among clans of Harfoots or Stoors. Even \\nin Bilbo\\'s time the strong Fallohidish strain could still be noted among the \\ngreater families, such as the Tooks and the Masters of Buckland. \\n\\nIn the westlands of Eriador, between the Misty Mountains and the \\nMountains of Lune, the Hobbits found both Men and Elves. Indeed, a remnant \\nstill dwelt there of the D(r)nedain, the kings of Men that came over the Sea \\nout of Westernesse; but they were dwindling fast and the lands of their \\nNorth Kingdom were falling far and wide into waste. There was room and to \\nspare for incomers, and ere long the Hobbits began to settle in ordered \\ncommunities. Most of their earlier settlements had long disappeared and been \\nforgotten in Bilbo\\'s time; but one of the first to become important still \\nendured, though reduced in size; this was at Bree and in the Chetwood that \\nlay round about, some forty miles east of the Shire. \\n\\nIt was in these early days, doubtless, that the Hobbits learned their \\nletters and began to write after the manner of the D(r)nedain, who had in \\ntheir turn long before learned the art from the Elves. And in those days \\nalso they forgot whatever languages they had used before, and spoke ever \\nafter the Common Speech, the Westron as it was named, that was current \\nthrough all the lands of the kings from Arnor to Gondor, and about all the \\ncoasts of the Sea from B elf alas to Lune. Yet they kept a few words of their \\nown, as well as their own names of months and days, and a great store of \\npersonal names out of the past. \\n\\nAbout this time legend among the Hobbits first becomes history with a \\nreckoning of years. For it was in the one thousand six hundred and first \\nyear of the Third Age that the Fallohide brothers, Marcho and Blanco, set \\nout from Bree; and having obtained permission from the high king at \\nFornostl, they crossed the brown river Baranduin with a great following of \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHobbits. They passed over the Bridge of Stonebows, that had been built in \\nthe days of the power of the North Kingdom, and they took ail the land \\nbeyond to dwell in, between the river and the Far Downs. All that was \\ndemanded of them was that they should keep the Great Bridge in repair, and \\nall other bridges and roads, speed the king\\'s messengers, and acknowledge \\nhis lordship. \\n\\nThus began the Shire-reckoning, for the year of the crossing of the \\nBrandywine (as the Hobbits turned the name) became Year One of the Shire, \\nand all later dates were reckoned from it. 2 At once the western Hobbits fell \\nin love with their new land, and they remained there, and soon passed once \\nmore out of the history of Men and of Elves. While there was still a king \\nthey were in name his subjects, but they were, in fact, ruled by their own \\nchieftains and meddled not at all with events in the world outside. To the \\nlast battle at Fornost with the Witch-lord of Angmar they sent some bowmen \\nto the aid of the king, or so they maintained, though no tales of Men record \\nit. But in that war the North Kingdom ended; and then the Hobbits took the \\nland for their own, and they chose from their own chiefs a Thain to hold the \\nauthority of the king that was gone. There for a thousand years they were \\nlittle troubled by wars, and they prospered and multiplied after the Dark \\nPlague (S.R. 37) until the disaster of the Long Winter and the famine that \\nfollowed it. Many thousands then perished, but the Days of Dearth (1158-60) \\nwere at the time of this tale long past and the Hobbits had again become \\naccustomed to plenty. The land was rich and kindly, and though it had long \\nbeen deserted when they entered it, it had before been well tilled, and \\nthere the king had once had many farms, cornlands, vineyards, and woods. \\n\\nForty leagues it stretched from the Far Downs to the Brandywine Bridge, \\nand fifty from the northern moors to the marshes in the south. The Hobbits \\nnamed it the Shire, as the region of the authority of their Thain, and a \\ndistrict of well-ordered business; and there in that pleasant comer of the \\nworld they plied their well-ordered business of living, and they heeded less \\nand less the world outside where dark things moved, until they came to think \\nthat peace and plenty were the rule in Middle-earth and the right of all \\nsensible folk. They forgot or ignored what little they had ever known of the \\nGuardians, and of the labours of those that made possible the long peace of \\nthe Shire. They were, in fact, sheltered, but they had ceased to remember \\nit. \\n\\nAt no time had Hobbits of any kind been warlike, and they had never \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfought among themselves. In olden days they had, of course, been often \\nobliged to fight to maintain themselves in a hard world; but in Bilbo\\'s time \\nthat was very ancient history. The last battle, before this story opens, and \\nindeed the only one that had ever been fought within the borders of the \\nShire, was beyond living memory: the Battle of Greenfields, S.R. 1147, in \\nwhich Bandobras Took routed an invasion of Ores. Even the weathers had \\ngrown \\n\\nmilder, and the wolves that had once come ravening out of the North in \\nbitter white winters were now only a grandfather\\'s tale. So, though there \\nwas still some store of weapons in the Shire, these were used mostly as \\ntrophies, hanging above hearths or on walls, or gathered into the museum at \\nMichel Delving. The Mathom-house it was called; for anything that Hobbits \\nhad no immediate use for, but were unwilling to throw away, they called a \\nmathom. Their dwellings were apt to become rather crowded with mathoms, \\nand \\n\\nmany of the presents that passed from hand to hand were of that son. \\n\\nNonetheless, ease and peace had left this people still curiously tough. \\n\\nThey were, if it came to it, difficult to daunt or to kill; and they were, \\nperhaps, so unwearyingly fond of good things not least because they could, \\nwhen put to it, do without them, and could survive rough handling by grief, \\nfoe, or weather in a way that astonished those who did not know them well \\nand looked no further than their bellies and their well-fed faces. Though \\nslow to quarrel, and for sport killing nothing that lived, they were doughty \\nat bay, and at need could still handle arms. They shot well with the bow, \\nfor they were keen-eyed and sure at the mark. Not only with bows and arrows. \\nIf any Hobbit stooped for a stone, it was well to get quickly under cover, \\nas all trespassing beasts knew very well. \\n\\nAll Hobbits had originally lived in holes in the ground, or so they \\nbelieved, and in such dwellings they still felt most at home; but in the \\ncourse of time they had been obliged to adopt other forms of abode. Actually \\nin the Shire in Bilbo\\'s days it was, as a rule, only the richest and the \\npoorest Hobbits that maintained the old custom. The poorest went on living \\nin burrows of the most primitive kind, mere holes indeed, with only one \\nwindow or none; while the well-to-do still constructed more luxurious \\nversions of the simple diggings of old. But suitable sites for these large \\nand ramifying tunnels (or smicils as they called them) were not everywhere to \\nbe found; and in the flats and the low-lying districts the Hobbits, as they \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmultiplied, began to build above ground. Indeed, even in the hilly regions \\nand the older villages, such as Hobbiton or Tuckborough, or in the chief \\ntownship of the Shire, Michel Delving on the White Downs, there were now \\nmany houses of wood, brick, or stone. These were specially favoured by \\nmillers, smiths, ropers, and Cartwrights, and others of that sort; for even \\nwhen they had holes to live in. Hobbits had long been accustomed to build \\nsheds and workshops. \\n\\nThe habit of building farmhouses and barns was said to have begun among \\nthe inhabitants of the Marish down by the Brandywine. The Hobbits of that \\nquarter, the Eastfarthing, were rather large and heavy-legged, and they wore \\ndwarf-boots in muddy weather. But they were well known to be Stoors in a \\nlarge part of their blood, as indeed was shown by the down that many grew on \\ntheir chins. No Harfoot or Fallohide had any trace of a beard. Indeed, the \\nfolk of the Marish, and of Buckland, east of the River, which they \\nafterwards occupied, came for the most part later into the Shire up from \\nsouth-away; and they still had many peculiar names and strange words not \\nfound elsewhere in the Shire. \\n\\nIt is probable that the craft of building, as many other crafts beside, \\nwas derived from the D(r)nedain. But the Hobbits may have learned it direct \\nfrom the Elves, the teachers of Men in their youth. For the Elves of the \\nHigh Kindred had not yet forsaken Middle-earth, and they dwelt still at that \\ntime at the Grey Havens away to the west, and in other places within reach \\nof the Shire. Three Elf-towers of immemorial age were still to be seen on \\nthe Tower Hills beyond the western marches. They shone far off in the \\nmoonlight. The tallest was furthest away, standing alone upon a green mound. \\nThe Hobbits of the Westfarthing said that one could see the Sea from the lop \\nof that tower; but no Hobbit had ever been known to climb it. Indeed, few \\nHobbits had ever seen or sailed upon the Sea, and fewer still had ever \\nreturned to report it. Most Hobbits regarded even rivers and small boats \\nwith deep misgivings, and not many of them could swim. And as the days of \\nthe Shire lengthened they spoke less and less with the Elves, and grew \\nafraid of them, and distrustful of those that had dealings with them; and \\nthe Sea became a word of fear among them, and a token of death, and they \\nturned their faces away from the hills in the west. \\n\\nThe craft of building may have come from Elves or Men, but the Hobbits \\nused it in their own fashion. They did not go in for towers. Their houses \\nwere usually long, low, and comfortable. The oldest kind were, indeed, no \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmore than built imitations of smials, thatched with dry grass or straw, or \\nroofed with turves, and having walls somewhat bulged. That stage, however, \\nbelonged to the early days of the Shire, and hobbit -building had long since \\nbeen altered, improved by devices, learned from Dwarves, or discovered by \\nthemselves. A preference for round windows, and even round doors, was the \\nchief remaining peculiarity of hobbit-architecture. \\n\\nThe houses and the holes of Shire-hobbits were often large, and \\ninhabited by large families. (Bilbo and Frodo Baggins were as bachelors very \\nexceptional, as they were also in many other ways, such as their friendship \\nwith the Elves.) Sometimes, as in the case of the Tooks of Great Smials, or \\nthe Brandybucks of Brandy Hall, many generations of relatives lived in \\n(comparative) peace together in one ancestral and many -tunnelled mansion. \\nAll Hobbits were, in any case, clannish and reckoned up their relationships \\nwith great care. They drew long and elaborate family -trees with innumerable \\nbranches. In dealing with Hobbits it is important to remember who is related \\nto whom, and in what degree. It would be impossible in this book to set out \\na family -tree that included even the more important members of the more \\nimportant families at the time which these tales tell of. The genealogical \\ntrees at the end of the Red Book of Westmarch are a small book in \\nthemselves, and all but Hobbits would find them exceedingly dull. Hobbits \\ndelighted in such things, if they were accurate: they liked to have books \\nfilled with things that they already knew, set out fair and square with no \\ncontradictions. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2. Concerning Pipe-weed \\n\\n\\n\\nThere is another astonishing thing about Hobbits of old that must be \\nmentioned, an astonishing habit: they imbibed or inhaled, through pipes of \\nclay or wood, the smoke of the burning leaves of a herb, which they called \\npipe-weed or leaf, a variety probably of Nicotiana. A great deal of mystery \\nsurrounds the origin of this peculiar custom, or \\'art\\' as the Hobbits \\npreferred to call it. All that could be discovered about it in antiquity was \\nput together by Meriadoc Brandybuck (later Master of Buckland), and since he \\nand the tobacco of the Southfarthing play a part in the history that \\nfollows, his remarks in the introduction to his Herblore of the Shire may be \\nquoted. \\n\\n\\'This,\\' he says, \\'is the one art that we can certainly claim to be our \\nown invention. When Hobbits first began to smoke is not known, all the \\nlegends and family histories take it for granted; for ages folk in the Shire \\nsmoked various herbs, some fouler, some sweeter. But all accounts agree that \\nTobold Hornblower of Longbottom in the Southfarthing first grew the true \\npipe-weed in his gardens in the days of Isengrim the Second, about the year \\n1070 of Shire-reckoning. The best home-grown still comes from that district, \\nespecially the varieties now known as Longbottom Leaf, Old Toby, and \\nSouthern Star. \\n\\n\\'How Old Toby came by the plant is not recorded, for to his dying day \\nhe would not tell. He knew much about herbs, but he was no traveller. It is \\nsaid that in his youth he went often to Bree, though he certainly never went \\nfurther from the Shire than that. It is thus quite possible that he learned \\nof this plant in Bree, where now, at any rate, it grows well on the south \\nslopes of the hill. The Bree-hobbits claim to have been the first actual \\nsmokers of the pipe-weed. They claim, of course, to have done everything \\nbefore the people of the Shire, whom they refer to as \"colonists\"; but in \\nthis case their claim is, I think, likely to be true. And certainly it was \\nfrom Bree that the art of smoking the genuine weed spread in the recent \\ncenturies among Dwarves and such other folk, Rangers, Wizards, or wanderers, \\nas still passed to and fro through that ancient road-meeting. The home and \\ncentre of the an is thus to be found in the old inn of Bree, The Prancing \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPony, that has been kept by the family of Butterbur from time beyond record. \\n\\n\\'All the same, observations that I have made on my own many journeys \\nsouth have convinced me that the weed itself is not native to our parts of \\nthe world, but came northward from the lower Anduin, whither it was, I \\nsuspect, originally brought over Sea by the Men of Westernesse. It grows \\nabundantly in Gondor, and there is richer and larger than in the North, \\nwhere it is never found wild, and flourishes only in warm sheltered places \\nlike Longbottom. The Men of Gondor call it sweet galenas, and esteem it only \\nfor the fragrance of its flowers. From that land it must have been carried \\nup the Greenway during the long centuries between the coming of Elendil and \\nour own day. But even the D(r)nedain of Gondor allow us this credit: Hobbits \\nfirst put it into pipes. Not even the Wizards first thought of that before \\nwe did. Though one Wizard that I knew took up the art long ago, and became \\nas skilful in it as in all other things that he put his mind to.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3. Of the Ordering of the Shire \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Shire was divided into four quarters, the Farthings already \\nreferred to. North, South, East, and West; and these again each into a \\nnumber of folklands, which still bore the names of some of the old leading \\nfamilies, although by the time of this history these names were no longer \\nfound only in their proper folklands. Nearly all Tooks still lived in the \\nTookland, but that was not true of many other families, such as the \\nBagginses or the Boffins. Outside the Farthings were the East and West \\nMarches: the Buckland (see beginning of Chapter V, Book I); and the \\nWestmarch added to the Shire in S.R. 1462. \\n\\nThe Shire at this time had hardly any \\'government\\'. Families for the \\nmost part managed their own affairs. Growing food and eating it occupied \\nmost of their time. In other matters they were, as a rule, generous and not \\ngreedy, but contented and moderate, so that estates, farms, workshops, and \\nsmall trades tended to remain unchanged for generations. \\n\\nThere remained, of course, the ancient tradition concerning the high \\nking at Fornost, or Norbury as they called it, away north of the Shire. But \\nthere had been no king for nearly a thousand years, and even the ruins of \\nKings\\' Norbury were covered with grass. Yet the Hobbits still said of wild \\nfolk and wicked things (such as trolls) that they had not heard of the king. \\n\\nFor they attributed to the king of old all their essential laws; and usually \\nthey kept the laws of free will, because they were The Rules (as they said), \\nboth ancient and just. \\n\\nIt is true that the Took family had long been pre-eminent; for the \\noffice of Thain had passed to them (from the Oldbucks) some centuries \\nbefore, and the chief Took had borne that title ever since. The Thain was \\nthe master of the Shire-moot, and captain of the Shire-muster and the \\nHobbitry-in-arms, but as muster and moot were only held in times of \\nemergency, which no longer occurred, the Thainship had ceased to be more \\nthan a nominal dignity. The Took family was still, indeed, accorded a \\nspecial respect, for it remained both numerous and exceedingly wealthy, and \\nwas liable to produce in every generation strong characters of peculiar \\nhabits and even adventurous temperament. The latter qualities, however, were \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnow rather tolerated (in the rich) than generally approved. The custom \\nendured, nonetheless, of referring to the head of the family as The Took, \\nand of adding to his name, if required, a number: such as Isengrim the \\nSecond, for instance. \\n\\nThe only real official in the Shire at this date was the Mayor of \\nMichel Delving (or of the Shire), who was elected every seven years at the \\nFree Fair on the White Downs at the Lithe, that is at Midsummer. As mayor \\nalmost his only duty was to preside at banquets, given on the \\nShire-holidays, which occurred at frequent intervals. But the offices of \\nPostmaster and First Shirriff were attached to the mayoralty, so that he \\nmanaged both the Messenger Service and the Watch. These were the only \\nShire-services, and the Messengers were the most numerous, and much the \\nbusier of the two. By no means all Hobbits were lettered, but those who were \\nwrote constantly to all their friends (and a selection of their relations) \\nwho lived further off than an afternoon\\'s walk. \\n\\nThe Shirriffs was the name that the Hobbits gave to their police, or \\nthe nearest equivalent that they possessed. They had, of course, no uniforms \\n(such things being quite unknown), only a feather in their caps; and they \\nwere in practice rather haywards than policemen, more concerned with the \\nstrayings of beasts than of people. There were in all the Shire only twelve \\nof them, three in each Farthing, for Inside Work. A rather larger body, \\nvarying at need, was employed to \\'beat the bounds\\', and to see that \\nOutsiders of any kind, great or small, did not make themselves a nuisance. \\n\\nAt the time when this story begins the Bounders, as they were called, \\nhad been greatly increased. There were many reports and complaints of \\nstrange persons and creatures prowling about the borders, or over them: the \\nfirst sign that all was not quite as it should be, and always had been \\nexcept in tales and legends of long ago. Few heeded the sign, and not even \\nBilbo yet had any notion of what it portended. Sixty years had passed since \\nhe set out on his memorable journey, and he was old even for Hobbits, who \\nreached a hundred as often as not; but much evidently still remained of the \\nconsiderable wealth that he had brought back. How much or how little he \\nrevealed to no one, not even to Frodo his favourite \\'nephew\\'. And he still \\nkept secret the ring that he bad found. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4. Of the Finding of the Ring \\n\\n\\n\\nAs is told in The Hobbit , there came one day to Bilbo\\'s door the great \\nWizard, Gandalf the Grey, and thirteen dwarves with him: none other, indeed, \\nthan Thorin Oakenshield, descendant of kings, and his twelve companions in \\nexile. With them he set out, to his own lasting astonishment, on a morning \\nof April, it being then the year 1341 Shire-reckoning, on a quest of great \\ntreasure, the dwarf-hoards of the Kings under the Mountain, beneath Erebor \\nin Dale, far off in the East. The quest was successful, and the Dragon that \\nguarded the hoard was destroyed. Yet, though before all was won the Battle \\nof Five Armies was fought, and Thorin was slain, and many deeds of renown \\nwere done, the matter would scarcely have concerned later history, or earned \\nmore than a note in the long annals of the Third Age, but for an \\'accident\\' \\nby the way. The party was assailed by Ores in a high pass of the Misty \\nMountains as they went towards Wilderland; and so it happened that Bilbo was \\nlost for a while in the black ore-mines deep under the mountains, and there, \\nas he groped in vain in the dark, he put his hand on a ring, lying on the \\nfloor of a tunnel. Ele put it in his pocket. It seemed then like mere luck. \\n\\nTrying to find his way out. Bilbo went on down to the roots of the \\nmountains, until he could go no further. At the bottom of the tunnel lay a \\ncold lake far from the light, and on an island of rock in the water lived \\nGollum. He was a loathsome little creature: he paddled a small boat with his \\nlarge flat feet, peering with pale luminous eyes and catching blind fish \\nwith his long fingers, and eating them raw. He ate any living thing, even \\nore, if he could catch it and strangle it without a struggle. He possessed a \\nsecret treasure that had come to him long ages ago, when he still lived in \\nthe light: a ring of gold that made its wearer invisible. It was the one \\nthing he loved, his \\'precious\\', and he talked to it, even when it was not \\nwith him. For he kept it hidden safe in a hole on his island, except when he \\nwas hunting or spying on the ores of the mines. \\n\\nMaybe he would have attacked Bilbo at once, if the ring had been on him \\nwhen they met; but it was not, and the hobbit held in his hand an Elvish \\nknife, which served him as a sword. So to gain time Gollum challenged Bilbo \\nto the Riddle-game, saying that if he asked a riddle which Bilbo could not \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nguess, then he would kill him and eat him; but if Bilbo defeated him, then \\nhe would do as Bilbo wished: he would lead him to a way out of the tunnels. \\n\\nSince he was lost in the dark without hope, and could neither go on nor \\nback. Bilbo accepted the challenge; and they asked one another many riddles. \\nIn the end Bilbo won the game, more by luck (as it seemed) than by wits; for \\nhe was stumped at last for a riddle to ask, and cried out, as his hand came \\nupon the ring he lad picked up and forgotten: What haw I got in my pocket? \\nThis Gollum failed to answer, though he demanded three guesses. \\n\\nThe Authorities, it is true, differ whether this last question was a \\nmere \\'question\\' and not a \\'riddle\\' according to the strict rules of the \\nGame; but all agree that, after accepting it and trying to guess the answer, \\nGollum was bound by his promise. And Bilbo pressed him to keep his word; \\nfor \\n\\nthe thought came to him that this slimy creature might prove false, even \\nthough such promises were held sacred, and of old all but the wickedest \\nthings feared to break them. But after ages alone in the dark Gollum\\'s heart \\nwas black, and treachery was in it. He slipped away, and returned to the \\nisland, of which Bilbo knew nothing, not far off in the dark water. There, \\nhe thought, lay his ring. He was hungry now, and angry, and once his \\n\\'precious\\' was with him he would not fear any weapon at all. \\n\\nBut the ring was not on the island; he had lost it, it was gone. His \\nscreech sent a shiver down Bilbo\\'s back, though he did not yet understand \\nwhat had happened. But Gollum had at last leaped to a guess, too late. What \\nhas it got in its pocketses? he cried. The light in his eyes was like a \\ngreen flame as he sped back to murder the hobbit and recover his \\'precious\\'. \\nJust in time Bilbo saw his peril, and he fled blindly up the passage away \\nfrom the water; and once more he was saved by his luck. For just as he ran \\nhe put his hand in his pocket, and the ring slipped quietly on to his \\nfinger. So it was that Gollum passed him without seeing him, and went to \\nguard the way out, lest the \\'thief should escape. Warily Bilbo followed \\nhim, as he went along, cursing, and talking to himself about his \\'precious\\'; \\nfrom which talk at last even Bilbo guessed the truth, and hope came to him \\nin the darkness: he himself had found the marvellous ring and a chance of \\nescape from the ores and from Gollum. \\n\\nAt length they came to a halt before an unseen opening that led to the \\nlower gates of the mines, on the eastward side of the mountains. There \\nGollum crouched at bay, smelling and listening; and Bilbo was tempted to \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nslay him with his sword. But pity stayed him, and though he kept the ring, \\nin which his only hope lay, he would not use it to help him kill the \\nwretched creature at a disadvantage. In the end, gathering his courage, he \\nleaped over Gollum in the dark, and fled away down the passage, pursued by \\nhis enemy\\'s cries of hate and despair: Thief thief! Baggins! We hates it \\nfor ever! \\n\\nNow it is a curious fact that this is not the story as Bilbo first told \\nit to his companions. To them his account was that Gollum had promised to \\ngive him a present, if he won the game; but when Gollum went to fetch it \\nfrom his island he found the treasure was gone: a magic ring, which had been \\ngiven to him long ago on his birthday. Bilbo guessed that this was the very \\nring that he had found, and as he had won the game, it was already his by \\nright. But being in a tight place, he said nothing about it, and made Gollum \\nshow him the way out, as a reward instead of a present. This account Bilbo \\nset down in his memoirs, and he seems never to have altered it himself, not \\neven after the Council of Elrond. Evidently it still appeared in the \\noriginal Red Book, as it did in several of the copies and abstracts. But \\nmany copies contain the true account (as an alternative), derived no doubt \\nfrom notes by Frodo or Samwise, both of whom learned the truth, though they \\nseem to have been unwilling to delete anything actually written by the old \\nhobbit himself. \\n\\nGandalf, however, disbelieved Bilbo\\'s first story, as soon as he heard \\nit, and he continued to be very curious about the ring. Eventually he got \\nthe true tale out of Bilbo after much questioning, which for a while \\nstrained their friendship; but the wizard seemed to think the truth \\nimportant. Though he did not say so to Bilbo, he also thought it important, \\nand disturbing, to find that the good hobbit had not told the truth from the \\nfirst: quite contrary to his habit. The idea of a \\'present\\' was not mere \\nhobbitlike invention, all the same. It was suggested to Bilbo, as he \\nconfessed, by Gollum\\'s talk that he overheard; for Gollum did, in fact, call \\nthe ring his \\'birthday present\\', many times. That also Gandalf thought \\nstrange and suspicious; but he did not discover the truth in this point for \\nmany more years, as will be seen in this book. \\n\\nOf Bilbo\\'s later adventures little more need be said here. With the \\nhelp of the ring he escaped from the ore-guards at the gate and rejoined his \\ncompanions. He used the ring many times on his quest, chiefly for the help \\nof his friends; but he kept it secret from them as long as he could. After \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhis return to his home he never spoke of it again to anyone, save Gandalf \\nand Frodo; and no one else in the Shire knew of its existence, or so he \\nbelieved. Only to Frodo did he show the account of his Journey that he was \\nwriting. \\n\\nHis sword, Sting, Bilbo hung over his fireplace, and his coat of \\nmarvellous mail, the gift of the Dwarves from the Dragon -hoard, he lent to a \\nmuseum, to the Michel Delving Mathom-house in fact. But he kept in a drawer \\nat Bag End the old cloak and hood that he had worn on his travels; and the \\nring, secured by a fine chain, remained in his pocket. \\n\\nHe returned to his home at Bag End on June the 22nd in his fifty-second \\nyear (S.R. 1342), and nothing very notable occurred in the Shire until Mr. \\nBaggins began the preparations for the celebration of his \\nhundred-and-eleventh birthday (S.R. 1401). At this point this History \\nbegins. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNOTE ON THE SHIRE RECORDS \\n\\n\\n\\nAt the end of the Third Age the part played by the Hobbits in the great \\nevents that led to the inclusion of the Shire in the Reunited Kingdom \\nawakened among them a more widespread interest in their own history; and \\nmany of their traditions, up to that time still mainly oral, were collected \\nand Written down. The greater families were also concerned with events in \\nthe Kingdom at large, and many of their members studied its ancient \\nhistories and legends. By the end of the first century of the Fourth Age \\nthere were already to be found in the Shire several libraries that contained \\nmany historical books and records. \\n\\nThe largest of these collections were probably at Undertowers, at Great \\nSmials, and at Brandy Hall. This account of the end of the Third Age is \\ndrawn mainly from the Red Book of Westmarch. That most important source \\nfor \\n\\nthe history of the War of the Ring was so called because it was long \\npreserved at Undertowers, the home of the Fairbairns, Wardens of the \\nWestmarch. 1 It was in origin Bilbo\\'s private diary, which he took with him \\nto Rivendell. Frodo brought it back to the Shire, together with many loose \\nleaves of notes, and during S.R. 1420-1 he nearly filled its pages with his \\naccount of the War. But annexed to it and preserved with it, probably m a \\nsingle red case, were the three large volumes, bound in red leather, that \\nBilbo gave to him as a parting gift. To these four volumes there was added \\nin Westmarch a fifth containing commentaries, genealogies, and various other \\nmatter concerning the hobbit members of the Fellowship. \\n\\nThe original Red Book has not been preserved, but many copies were \\nmade, especially of the first volume, for the use of the descendants of the \\nchildren of Master Samwise. The most important copy, however, has a \\ndifferent history. It was kept at Great Smials, but it was written in \\nCondor, probably at the request of the great-grandson of Peregrin, and \\ncompleted in S.R. 1592 (F.A. 172). Its southern scribe appended this note: \\nFindegil, King\\'s Writer, finished this work in IV 172. It is an exact copy \\nin all details of the Thain\\'s Book m Minas Tirith. That book was a copy, \\nmade at the request of King Elessar, of the Red Book of the Periannath, and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwas brought to him by the Thain Peregrin when he retired to Gondor in IV 64. \\n\\nThe Thain\\'s Book was thus the first copy made of the Red Book and \\ncontained much that was later omitted or lost. In Minas Tirith it received \\nmuch annotation, and many corrections, especially of names, words, and \\nquotations in the Elvish languages; and there was added to it an abbreviated \\nversion of those parts of The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen which lie outside \\nthe account of the War. The full tale is stated to have been written by \\nBarahir, grandson of the Steward Faramir, some time after the passing of the \\nKing. But the chief importance of Findegil\\'s copy is that it alone contains \\nthe whole of Bilbo\\'s \\'Translations from the Elvish\\'. These three volumes \\nwere found to be a work of great skill and learning in which, between 1403 \\nand 1418, he had used all the sources available to him in Rivendell, both \\nliving and written. But since they were little used by Frodo, being almost \\nentirely concerned with the Elder Days, no more is said of them here. \\n\\nSince Meriadoc and Peregrin became the heads of their great families, \\nand at the same time kept up their connexions with Rohan and Gondor, the \\nlibraries at Bucklebury and Tuckborough contained much that did not appear \\nin the Red Book. In Brandy Hall there were many works dealing with Eriador \\nand the history of Rohan. Some of these were composed or begun by \\nMeriadoc \\n\\nhimself, though in the Shire he was chiefly remembered for his Herhlore of \\nthe Shire, and for his Reckoning of Years m which he discussed the relation \\nof the calendars of the Shire and Bree to those of Rivendell, Gondor, and \\nRohan. He also wrote a short treatise on Old Words and Names in the Shire, \\nhaving special interest in discovering the kinship with the language of the \\nRohirrim of such \\'shire-words\\' as mathom and old elements in place names. \\n\\nAt Great Smials the books were of less interest to Shire-folk, though \\nmore important for larger history. None of them was written by Peregrin, but \\nhe and his successors collected many manuscripts written by scribes of \\nGondor: mainly copies or summaries of histories or legends relating to \\nElendil and his heirs. Only here in the Shire were to be found extensive \\nmaterials for the history of N(r)menor and the arising of Sauron. It was \\nprobably at Great Smials that The Tale of Years 1 was put together, with the \\nassistance of material collected by Meriadoc. Though the dates given are \\noften conjectural, especially for the Second Age, they deserve attention. It \\nis probable that Meriadoc obtained assistance and information from \\nRivendell, which he visited more than once. There, though Elrond had \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndeparted, his sons long remained, together with some of the High-elven folk. \\nIt is said that Celeborn went to dwell there after the departure of \\nGaladriel; but there is no record of the day when at last he sought the Grey \\nHavens, and with him went the last living memory of the Elder Days in \\nMiddle-earth. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* BOOK I * \\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 1 . A Long-expected Party \\n\\nWhen Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly be \\ncelebrating his eleventy -first birthday with a party of special \\nmagnificence, there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton. \\n\\nBilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder of the \\nShire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable disappearance and \\nunexpected return. The riches he had brought back from his travels had now \\nbecome a local legend, and it was popularly believed, whatever the old folk \\nmight say, that the Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed with \\ntreasure. And if that was not enough for fame, there was also his prolonged \\nvigour to marvel at. Time wore on, but it seemed to have little effect on \\nMr. Baggins. At ninety he was much the same as at fifty. At ninety-nine they \\nbegan to call him we//-preserved, but unchanged would have been nearer the \\nmark. There were some that shook their heads and thought this was too much \\nof a good thing; it seemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) \\nperpetual youth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth. \\n\\n\\'It will have to be paid for,\\' they said. \\'It isn\\'t natural, and \\ntrouble will come of it!\\' \\n\\nBut so far trouble had not come; and as Mr. Baggins was generous with \\nhis money, most people were willing to forgive him his oddities and his good \\nfortune. He remained on visiting terms with his relatives (except, of \\ncourse, the Sackville-Bagginses), and he had many devoted admirers among \\nthe \\n\\nhobbits of poor and unimportant families. But he had no close friends, until \\nsome of his younger cousins began to grow up. \\n\\nThe eldest of these, and Bilbo\\'s favourite, was young Frodo Baggins. \\nWhen Bilbo was ninety-nine, he adopted Frodo as his heir, and brought him to \\nlive at Bag End; and the hopes of the Sackville-Bagginses were finally \\ndashed. Bilbo and Frodo happened to have the same birthday, September \\n22nd. \\n\\n\\'You had better come and live here, Frodo my lad,\\' said Bilbo one day; \\'and \\nthen we can celebrate our birthday-parties comfortably together.\\' At that \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntime Frodo was still in his tweens, as the hobbits called the irresponsible \\ntwenties between childhood and coming of age at thirty-three. \\n\\nTwelve more years passed. Each year the Bagginses had given very lively \\ncombined birthday-parties at Bag End; but now it was understood that \\nsomething quite exceptional was being planned for that autumn. Bilbo was \\ngoing to be eleventy-one, 111, a rather curious number and a very \\nrespectable age for a hobbit (the Old Took himself had only reached 130); \\nand Frodo was going to be thirty-three, 33) an important number: the date of \\nhis \\'coming of age\\'. \\n\\nTongues began to wag in Flobbiton and By water; and rumour of the coming \\nevent travelled all over the Shire. The history and character of Mr. Bilbo \\nBaggins became once again the chief topic of conversation; and the older \\nfolk suddenly found their reminiscences in welcome demand. \\n\\nNo one had a more attentive audience than old Ham Gamgee, commonly \\nknown as the Gaffer. He held forth at The Ivy Bush , a small inn on the \\nBywater road; and he spoke with some authority, for he had tended the garden \\nat Bag End for forty years, and had helped old Holman in the same job before \\nthat. Now that he was himself growing old and stiff in the joints, the job \\nwas mainly carried on by his youngest son, Sam Gamgee. Both father and son \\nwere on very friendly terms with Bilbo and Frodo. They lived on the Hill \\nitself, in Number 3 Bagshot Row just below Bag End. \\n\\n\\'A very nice well-spoken gentlehobbit is Mr. Bilbo, as I\\'ve always \\nsaid,\\' the Gaffer declared. With perfect truth: for Bilbo was very polite to \\nhim, calling him \\'Master Hamfast\\', and consulting him constantly upon the \\ngrowing of vegetables - in the matter of \\'roots\\', especially potatoes, the \\nGaffer was recognized as the leading authority by all in the neighbourhood \\n(including himself). \\n\\n\\'But what about this Frodo that lives with him?\\' asked Old Noakes of \\nBy water. \\'Baggins is his name, but he\\'s more than half a Brandybuck, they \\nsay. It beats me why any Baggins of Hobbiton should go looking for a wife \\naway there in Buckland, where folks are so queer.\\' \\n\\n\\'And no wonder they\\'re queer,\\' put in Daddy Twofoot (the Gaffer\\'s \\nnext-door neighbour), \\'if they live on the wrong side of the Brandywine \\nRiver, and right agin the Old Forest. That\\'s a dark bad place, if half the \\ntales be true.\\' \\n\\n\\'You\\'re right, Dad!\\' said the Gaffer. \\'Not that the Brandybucks of \\nBuck-land live in the Old Forest; but they\\'re a queer breed, seemingly. They \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfool about with boats on that big river - and that isn\\'t natural. Small \\nwonder that trouble came of it, I say. But be that as it may, Mr. Frodo is \\nas nice a young hobbit as you could wish to meet. Very much like Mr. Bilbo, \\nand in more than looks. After all his father was a Baggins. A decent \\nrespectable hobbit was Mr. Drogo Baggins; there was never much to tell of \\nhim, till he was drownded.\\' \\n\\n\\'Drownded?\\' said several voices. They had heard this and other darker \\nrumours before, of course; but hobbits have a passion for family history, \\nand they were ready to hear it again. \\'Well, so they say,\\' said the Gaffer. \\n\\n\\'You see: Mr. Drogo, he married poor Miss Primula Brandybuck. She was \\nour \\n\\nMr. Bilbo\\'s first cousin on the mother\\'s side (her mother being the youngest \\nof the Old Took\\'s daughters); and Mr. Drogo was his second cousin. So Mr. \\nFrodo is his first and second cousin, once removed either way, as the saying \\nis, if you follow me. And Mr. Drogo was staying at Brandy Flail with his \\nfather-in-law, old Master Gorbadoc, as he often did after his marriage (him \\nbeing partial to his vittles, and old Gorbadoc keeping a mighty generous \\ntable); and he went out boating on the Brandywine River; and he and his wife \\nwere drownded, and poor Mr. Frodo only a child and all. \\' \\n\\n\\'I\\'ve heard they went on the water after dinner in the moonlight,\\' said \\nOld Noakes; \\'and it was Drogo\\'s weight as sunk the boat.\\' \\n\\n\\'And / heard she pushed him in, and he pulled her in after him,\\' said \\nSandy man, the Hobbiton miller. \\n\\n\\'You shouldn\\'t listen to all you hear, Sandyman,\\' said the Gaffer, who \\ndid not much like the miller. \\'There isn\\'t no call to go talking of pushing \\nand pulling. Boats are quite tricky enough for those that sit still without \\nlooking further for the cause of trouble. Anyway: there was this Mr. Frodo \\nleft an orphan and stranded, as you might say, among those queer \\nBucklanders, being brought up anyhow in Brandy Hall. A regular warren, by \\nall accounts. Old Master Gorbadoc never had fewer than a couple of hundred \\nrelations in the place. Mr. Bilbo never did a kinder deed than when he \\nbrought the lad back to live among decent folk. \\n\\n\\'But I reckon it was a nasty shock for those Sackville-Bagginses. They \\nthought they were going to get Bag End, that time when he went off and was \\nthought to be dead. And then he comes back and orders them off; and he goes \\non living and living, and never looking a day older, bless him! And suddenly \\nhe produces an heir, and has all the papers made out proper. The \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSackville-Bagginses won\\'t never see the inside of Bag End now, or it is to \\nbe hoped not.\\' \\n\\n\\'There\\'s a tidy bit of money tucked away up there, I hear tell,\\' said a \\nstranger, a visitor on business from Michel Delving in the Westfarthing. \\n\\n\\'All the top of your hill is full of tunnels packed with chests of gold and \\nsilver, and jools, by what I\\'ve heard. \\' \\n\\n\\'Then you\\'ve heard more than I can speak to,\\' answered the Gaffer. I \\nknow nothing about jools. Mr. Bilbo is free with his money, and there seems \\nno lack of it; but I know of no tunnel -making. I saw Mr. Bilbo when he came \\nback, a matter of sixty years ago, when I was a lad. I\\'d not long come \\nprentice to old Holman (him being my dad\\'s cousin), but he had me up at Bag \\nEnd helping him to keep folks from trampling and trapessing all over the \\ngarden while the sale was on. And in the middle of it all Mr. Bilbo comes up \\nthe Hill with a pony and some mighty big bags and a couple of chests. I \\ndon\\'t doubt they were mostly full of treasure he had picked up in foreign \\nparts, where there be mountains of gold, they say; but there wasn\\'t enough \\nto fill tunnels. But my lad Sam will know more about that. He\\'s in and out \\nof Bag End. Crazy about stories of the old days he is, and he listens to all \\nMr. Bilbo\\'s tales. Mr. Bilbo has learned him his letters - meaning no harm, \\nmark you, and I hope no harm will come of it. \\n\\n\\'Elves and Dragons\\' Isays to him. \\'Cabbages and potatoes are better \\nfor me and you. Don \\'t go getting mixed up in the business of your betters, \\nor you\\'ll land in trouble too big for you, \\' I says to him. And I might say \\nit to others,\\' he added with a look at the stranger and the miller. \\n\\nBut the Gaffer did not convince his audience. The legend of Bilbo\\'s \\nwealth was now too firmly fixed in the minds of the younger generation of \\nhobbits. \\n\\n\\'Ah, but he has likely enough been adding to what he brought at first,\\' \\nargued the miller, voicing common opinion. \\'He\\'s often away from home. And \\nlook at the outlandish folk that visit him: dwarves coming at night, and \\nthat old wandering conjuror, Gandalf, and all. You can say what you like, \\nGaffer, but Bag End\\'s a queer place, and its folk are queerer.\\' \\n\\n\\'And you can say what you like, about what you know no more of than you \\ndo of boating, Mr. Sandyman,\\' retorted the Gaffer, disliking the miller even \\nmore than usual. If that\\'s being queer, then we could do with a bit more \\nqueerness in these parts. There\\'s some not far away that wouldn\\'t offer a \\npint of beer to a friend, if they lived in a hole with golden walls. But \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthey do things proper at Bag End. Our Sam says that everyone\\'s going to be \\ninvited to the party, and there\\'s going to be presents, mark you, presents \\nfor all - this very month as is.\\' \\n\\nThat very month was September, and as fine as you could ask. A day or \\ntwo later a rumour (probably started by the knowledgeable Sam) was spread \\nabout that there were going to be fireworks - fireworks, what is more, such \\nas had not been seen in the Shire for nigh on a century, not indeed since \\nthe Old Took died. \\n\\nDays passed and The Day drew nearer. An odd-looking waggon laden with \\nodd-looking packages rolled into Hobbiton one evening and toiled up the Hill \\nto Bag End. The startled hobbits peered out of lamplit doors to gape at it. \\n\\nIt was driven by outlandish folk, singing strange songs: dwarves with long \\nbeards and deep hoods. A few of them remained at Bag End. At the end of the \\nsecond week in September a cart came in through Bywater from the direction \\nof the Brandywine Bridge in broad daylight. An old man was driving it all \\nalone. He wore a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, and a silver \\nscarf. He had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows that stuck out beyond \\nthe brim of his hat. Small hobbit-children ran after the cart all through \\nHobbiton and right up the hill. It had a cargo of fireworks, as they rightly \\nguessed. At Bilbo\\'s front door the old man began to unload: there were great \\nbundles of fireworks of all sorts and shapes, each labelled with a large red \\nG and the elf-rune, . \\n\\nThat was Gandalf s mark, of course, and the old man was Gandalf the \\nWizard, whose fame in the Shire was due mainly to his skill with fires, \\nsmokes, and lights. His real business was far more difficult and dangerous, \\nbut the Shire-folk knew nothing about it. To them he was just one of the \\n\\'attractions\\' at the Party. Hence the excitement of the hobbit-children. \\'G \\nfor Grand!\\' they shouted, and the old man smiled. They knew him by sight, \\nthough he only appeared in Hobbiton occasionally and never stopped long; but \\nneither they nor any but the oldest of their elders had seen one of his \\nfirework displays - they now belonged to the legendary past. \\n\\nWhen the old man, helped by Bilbo and some dwarves, had finished \\nunloading. Bilbo gave a few pennies away; but not a single squib or cracker \\nwas forthcoming, to the disappointment of the onlookers. \\n\\n\\'Run away now!\\' said Gandalf. \\'You will get plenty when the time \\ncomes.\\' Then he disappeared inside with Bilbo, and the door was shut. The \\nyoung hobbits stared at the door in vain for a while, and then made off, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfeeling that the day of the party would never come. \\n\\nInside Bag End, Bilbo and Gandalf were sitting at the open window of a \\nsmall room looking out west on to the garden. The late afternoon was bright \\nand peaceful. The flowers glowed red and golden: snap-dragons and \\nsun-flowers, and nasturtiums trailing all over the turf walls and peeping in \\nat the round windows. \\n\\n\\'How bright your garden looks!\\' said Gandalf. \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Bilbo. I am very fond indeed of it, and of all the dear old \\nShire; but I think I need a holiday.\\' \\n\\n\\'You mean to go on with your plan then?\\' \\n\\n\\'I do. I made up my mind months ago, and I haven\\'t changed it.\\' \\n\\n\\'Very well. It is no good saying any more. Stick to your plan - your \\nwhole plan, mind - and I hope it will turn out for the best, for you, and \\nfor all of us.\\' \\n\\n\\'I hope so. Anyway I mean to enjoy myself on Thursday, and have my \\nlittle joke.\\' \\n\\n\\'Who will laugh, I wonder?\\' said Gandalf, shaking his head. \\n\\n\\'We shall see,\\' said Bilbo. \\n\\nThe next day more carts rolled up the Hill, and still more carts. There \\nmight have been some grumbling about \\'dealing locally\\', but that very week \\norders began to pour out of Bag End for every kind of provision, commodity, \\nor luxury that could be obtained in Hobbiton or Bywater or anywhere in the \\nneighbourhood. People became enthusiastic; and they began to tick off the \\ndays on the calendar; and they watched eagerly for the postman, hoping for \\ninvitations. \\n\\nBefore long the invitations began pouring out, and the Hobbiton \\npost-office was blocked, and the Bywater post-office was snowed under, and \\nvoluntary assistant postmen were called for. There was a constant stream of \\nthem going up the Hill, carrying hundreds of polite variations on Thank you, \\n\\nI shall certainly come. \\n\\nA notice appeared on the gate at Bag End: NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT \\nON PARTY \\n\\nBUSINESS. Even those who had, or pretended to have Party Business were \\nseldom allowed inside. Bilbo was busy: writing invitations, ticking off \\nanswers, packing up presents, and making some private preparations of his \\nown. From the time of Gandalf s arrival he remained hidden from view. \\n\\nOne morning the hobbits woke to find the large field, south of Bilbo\\'s \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfront door, covered with ropes and poles for tents and pavilions. A special \\nentrance was cut into the bank leading to the road, and wide steps and a \\nlarge white gate were built there. The three hobbit-families of Bagshot Row, \\nadjoining the field, were intensely interested and generally envied. Old \\nGaffer Gamgee stopped even pretending to work in his garden. \\n\\nThe tents began to go up. There was a specially large pavilion, so big \\nthat the tree that grew in the field was right inside it, and stood proudly \\nnear one end, at the head of the chief table. Lanterns were hung on all its \\nbranches. More promising still (to the hobbits\\' mind): an enormous open-air \\nkitchen was erected in the north corner of the field. A draught of cooks, \\nfrom every inn and eating-house for miles around, arrived to supplement the \\ndwarves and other odd folk that were quartered at Bag End. Excitement rose \\nto its height. \\n\\nThen the weather clouded over. That was on Wednesday the eve of the \\nParty. Anxiety was intense. Then Thursday, September the 22nd, actually \\ndawned. The sun got up, the clouds vanished, flags were unfurled and the fun \\nbegan. \\n\\nBilbo Baggins called it a party, but it was really a variety of \\nentertainments rolled into one. Practically everybody living near was \\ninvited. A very few were overlooked by accident, but as they turned up all \\nthe same, that did not matter. Many people from other parts of the Shire \\nwere also asked; and there were even a few from outside the borders. Bilbo \\nmet the guests (and additions) at the new white gate in person. Ele gave away \\npresents to all and sundry - the latter were those who went out again by a \\nback way and came in again by the gate. Hobbits give presents to other \\npeople on their own birthdays. Not very expensive ones, as a rule, and not \\nso lavishly as on this occasion; but it was not a bad system. Actually in \\nHobbiton and Bywater every day in the year it was somebody\\'s birthday, so \\nthat every hobbit in those parts had a fair chance of at least one present \\nat least once a week. But they never got tired of them. \\n\\nOn this occasion the presents were unusually good. The hobbit-children \\nwere so excited that for a while they almost forgot about eating. There were \\ntoys the like of which they had never seen before, all beautiful and some \\nobviously magical. Many of them had indeed been ordered a year before, and \\nhad come all the way from the Mountain and from Dale, and were of real \\ndwarf-make. \\n\\nWhen every guest had been welcomed and was finally inside the gate, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthere were songs, dances, music, games, and, of course, food and drink. \\nThere were three official meals: lunch, tea, and dinner (or supper). But \\nlunch and tea were marked chiefly by the fact that at those times all the \\nguests were sitting down and eating together. At other times there were \\nmerely lots of people eating and drinking - continuously from elevenses \\nuntil six-thirty, when the fireworks started. \\n\\nThe fireworks were by Gandalf: they were not only brought by him, but \\ndesigned and made by him; and the special effects, set pieces, and flights \\nof rockets were let off by him. But there was also a generous distribution \\nof squibs, crackers, backarappers, sparklers, torches, dwarf-candles, \\nelf-fountains, goblin -barkers and thunder -claps. They were all superb. The \\nart of Gandalf improved with age. \\n\\nThere were rockets like a flight of scintillating birds singing with \\nsweet voices. There were green trees with trunks of dark smoke: their leaves \\nopened like a whole spring unfolding in a moment, and their shining branches \\ndropped glowing flowers down upon the astonished hobbits, disappearing with \\na sweet scent just before they touched their upturned faces. There were \\nfountains of butterflies that flew glittering into the trees; there were \\npillars of coloured fires that rose and turned into eagles, or sailing \\nships, or a phalanx of flying swans; there was a red thunderstorm and a \\nshower of yellow rain; there was a forest of silver spears that sprang \\nsuddenly into the air with a yell like an embattled army, and came down \\nagain into the Water with a hiss like a hundred hot snakes. And there was \\nalso one last surprise, in honour of Bilbo, and it startled the hobbits \\nexceedingly, as Gandalf intended. The lights went out. A great smoke went \\nup. It shaped itself like a mountain seen in the distance, and began to glow \\nat the summit. It spouted green and scarlet flames. Out flew a red -golden \\ndragon - not life-size, but terribly life-like: fire came from his jaws, his \\neyes glared down; there was a roar, and he whizzed three times over the \\nheads of the crowd. They all ducked, and many fell flat on their faces. The \\ndragon passed like an express train, turned a somersault, and burst over \\nBywater with a deafening explosion. \\n\\nThat is the signal for supper!\\' said Bilbo. The pain and alarm \\nvanished at once, and the prostrate hobbits leaped to their feet. There was \\na splendid supper for everyone; for everyone, that is, except those invited \\nto the special family dinner-party. This was held in the great pavilion with \\nthe tree. The invitations were limited to twelve dozen (a number also called \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nby the hobbits one Gross, though the word was not considered proper to use \\nof people); and the guests were selected from all the families to which \\nBilbo and Frodo were related, with the addition of a few special unrelated \\nfriends (such as Gandalf). Many young hobbits were included, and present by \\nparental permission; for hobbits were easy-going with their children in the \\nmatter of sitting up late, especially when there was a chance of getting \\nthem a free meal. Bringing up young hobbits took a lot of provender. \\n\\nThere were many Bagginses and Boffins, and also many Tooks and \\nBrandybucks; there were various Grubbs (relations of Bilbo Baggins\\' \\ngrandmother), and various Chubbs (connexions of his Took grandfather); and \\nselection of Burrowses, Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Brockhouses, Goodbodies, \\nHornblowers and Proudfoots. Some of these were only very distantly \\nconnected \\n\\nwith Bilbo, and some of them had hardly ever been in Hobbiton before, as \\nthey lived in remote corners of the Shire. The Sackville-Bagginses were not \\nforgotten. Otho and his wife Lobelia were present. They disliked Bilbo and \\ndetested Frodo, but so magnificent was the invitation card, written in \\ngolden ink, that they had felt it was impossible to refuse. Besides, their \\ncousin, Bilbo, had been specializing in food for many years and his table \\nhad a high reputation. \\n\\nAll the one hundred and forty-four guests expected a pleasant feast; \\nthough they rather dreaded the after-dinner speech of their host (an \\ninevitable item). Fie was liable to drag in bits of what he called poetry; \\nand sometimes, after a glass or two, would allude to the absurd adventures \\nof his mysterious journey. The guests were not disappointed: they had a very \\npleasant feast, in fact an engrossing entertainment: rich, abundant, varied, \\nand prolonged. The purchase of provisions fell almost to nothing throughout \\nthe district in the ensuing weeks; but as Bilbo\\'s catering had depleted the \\nstocks of most stores, cellars and warehouses for miles around, that did not \\nmatter much. \\n\\nAfter the feast (more or less) came the Speech. Most of the company \\nwere, however, now in a tolerant mood, at that delightful stage which they \\ncalled \\'filling up the corners\\'. They were sipping their favourite drinks, \\nand nibbling at their favourite dainties, and their fears were forgotten. \\n\\nThey were prepared to listen to anything, and to cheer at every full stop. \\n\\nMy dear People, began Bilbo, rising in his place. \\'Flear! Flear! Hear!\\' \\nthey shouted, and kept on repeating it in chorus, seeming reluctant to \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfollow their own advice. Bilbo left his place and went and stood on a chair \\nunder the illuminated tree. The light of the lanterns fell on his beaming \\nface; the golden buttons shone on his embroidered silk waistcoat. They could \\nall see him standing, waving one hand in the air, the other was in his \\ntrouser -pocket. \\n\\nMy dear Bagginses and Boffins, he began again; and my dear Tooks and \\nBrandybucks, and Grubbs, and Chubbs, and Burrowses, and Hornblowers, \\nand \\n\\nBolgers, Bracegirdles, Goodbodies, Brockhouses and Proudfoots. \\n\\n\\'ProudFEET!\\' \\n\\nshouted an elderly hobbit from the back of the pavilion. His name, of \\ncourse, was Proudfoot, and well merited; his feet were large, exceptionally \\nfurry, and both were on the table. \\n\\nProudfoots, repeated Bilbo. Also my good Sackville-Bagginses that I \\nwelcome back at last to Bag End. Today is my one hundred and eleventh \\nbirthday: I am eleventy -one today!\\' Hurray! Hurray! Many Happy Returns!\\' \\nthey shouted, and they hammered joyously on the tables. Bilbo was doing \\nsplendidly. This was the sort of stuff they liked: short and obvious. \\n\\nI hope you are all enjoying yourselves as much as I am. Deafening \\ncheers. Cries of Yes (and No). Noises of trumpets and horns, pipes and \\nflutes, and other musical instruments. There were, as has been said, many \\nyoung hobbits present. Hundreds of musical crackers had been pulled. Most of \\nthem bore the mark DALE on them; which did not convey much to most of \\nthe \\n\\nhobbits, but they all agreed they were marvellous crackers. They contained \\ninstruments, small, but of perfect make and enchanting tones. Indeed, in one \\ncorner some of the young Tooks and Brandybucks, supposing Uncle Bilbo to \\nhave finished (since he had plainly said all that was necessary), now got up \\nan impromptu orchestra, and began a merry dance-tune. Master Everard Took \\nand Miss Melilot Brandybuck got on a table and with bells in their hands \\nbegan to dance the Springle-ring: a pretty dance, but rather vigorous. \\n\\nBut Bilbo had not finished. Seizing a horn from a youngster near by, he \\nblew three loud hoots. The noise subsided. / shall not keep you long, he \\ncried. Cheers from all the assembly. / have called you all together for a \\nPurpose. Something in the way that he said this made an impression. There \\nwas almost silence, and one or two of the Tooks pricked up their ears. \\n\\nIndeed, for Three Purposes! First of all, to tell you that I am \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nimmensely fond of you all, and that eleventy-one years is too short a time \\nto live among such excellent and admirable hobbits. Tremendous outburst of \\napproval. \\n\\n/ don \\'t know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less \\nthan half of you half as well as you deserve. This was unexpected and rather \\ndifficult. There was some scattered clapping, but most of them were trying \\nto work it out and see if it came to a compliment. \\n\\nSecondly, to celebrate my birthday. Cheers again. I should say: OUR \\nbirthday. For it is, of course, also the birthday of my heir and nephew, \\n\\nFrodo. He comes of age and into his inheritance today. Some perfunctory \\nclapping by the elders; and some loud shouts of \\'Frodo! Frodo! Jolly old \\nFrodo,\\' from the juniors. The Sackville-Bagginses scowled, and wondered what \\nwas meant by \\'coming into his inheritance\\'. Together we score one hundred \\nand forty-four. Your numbers were chosen to fit this remarkable total: One \\nGross, if I may use the expression. No cheers. This was ridiculous. Many of \\nhis guests, and especially the Sackville-Bagginses, were insulted, feeling \\nsure they had only been asked to fill up the required number, like goods in \\na package. \\'One Gross, indeed! Vulgar expression.\\' \\n\\nIt is also, if I may be allowed to refer to ancient history, the \\nanniversary of my arrival by barrel at Esgaroth on the Long Lake; though the \\nfact that it was my birthday slipped my memory on that occasion. I was only \\nfifty-one then, and birthdays did not seem so important. The banquet was \\nvery splendid, however, though I had a bad cold at the time, I remember, and \\ncould only say \\'thagyou very buch\\'. I now repeat it more correctly: Thank \\nyou very much for coming to my little party. Obstinate silence. They all \\nfeared that a song or some poetry was now imminent; and they were getting \\nbored. Why couldn\\'t he stop talking and let them drink his health? But Bilbo \\ndid not sing or recite. Fie paused for a moment. \\n\\nThirdly and finally, he said, I wish to make an ANNOUNCEMENT. Fie \\nspoke \\n\\nthis last word so loudly and suddenly that everyone sat up who still could. \\n\\nI regret to announce that - though, as I said, eleventy-one years is far too \\nshort a time to spend among you - this is the END. I am going. I am leaving \\nNOW. GOOD-BYE 7 \\n\\nHe stepped down and vanished. There was a blinding flash of light, and \\nthe guests all blinked. When they opened their eyes Bilbo was nowhere to be \\nseen. One hundred and forty-four flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOld Odo Proudfoot removed his feet from the table and stamped. Then there \\nwas a dead silence, until suddenly, after several deep breaths, every \\nBaggins, Boffin, Took, Brandybuck, Grubb, Chubb, Burrows, Bolger, \\nBracegirdle, Brockhouse, Goodbody, Hornblower, and Proudfoot began to \\ntalk \\n\\nat once. \\n\\nIt was generally agreed that the joke was in very bad taste, and more \\nfood and drink were needed to cure the guests of shock and annoyance. \\'He\\'s \\nmad. I always said so,\\' was probably the most popular comment. Even the \\nTooks (with a few exceptions) thought Bilbo\\'s behaviour was absurd. For the \\nmoment most of them took it for granted that his disappearance was nothing \\nmore than a ridiculous prank. \\n\\nBut old Rory Brandybuck was not so sure. Neither age nor an enormous \\ndinner had clouded his wits, and he said to his daughter-in-law, Esmeralda: \\n\\'There\\'s something fishy in this, my dear! I believe that mad Baggins is off \\nagain. Silly old fool. But why worry? He hasn\\'t taken the vittles with him.\\' \\n\\nHe called loudly to Frodo to send the wine round again. \\n\\nFrodo was the only one present who had said nothing. For some time he \\nhad sat silent beside Bilbo\\'s empty chair, and ignored all remarks and \\nquestions. He had enjoyed the joke, of course, even though he had been in \\nthe know. He had difficulty in keeping from laughter at the indignant \\nsurprise of the guests. But at the same time he felt deeply troubled: he \\nrealized suddenly that he loved the old hobbit dearly. Most of the guests \\nwent on eating and drinking and discussing Bilbo Baggins\\' oddities, past and \\npresent; but the Sackville-Bagginses had already departed in wrath. Frodo \\ndid not want to have any more to do with the party. He gave orders for more \\nwine to be served; then he got up and drained his own glass silently to the \\nhealth of Bilbo, and slipped out of the pavilion. \\n\\nAs for Bilbo Baggins, even while he was making his speech, he had been \\nfingering the golden ring in his pocket: his magic ring that he had kept \\nsecret for so many years. As he stepped down he slipped it on his finger, \\nand he was never seen by any hobbit in Hobbiton again. \\n\\nHe walked briskly back to his hole, and stood for a moment listening \\nwith a smile to the din in the pavilion and to the sounds of merrymaking in \\nother parts of the field. Then he went in. He took off his party clothes, \\nfolded up and wrapped in tissue-paper his embroidered silk waistcoat, and \\nput it away. Then he put on quickly some old untidy garments, and fastened \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nround his waist a worn leather belt. On it he hung a short sword in a \\nbattered black-leather scabbard. From a locked drawer, smelling of \\nmoth-balls, he took out an old cloak and hood. They had been locked up as if \\nthey were very precious, but they were so patched and weatherstained that \\ntheir original colour could hardly be guessed: it might have been dark \\ngreen. They were rather too large for him. He then went into his study, and \\nfrom a large strong-box took out a bundle wrapped in old cloths, and a \\nleather -bound manuscript; and also a large bulky envelope. The book and \\nbundle he stuffed into the top of a heavy bag that was standing there, \\nalready nearly full. Into the envelope he slipped his golden ring, and its \\nfine chain, and then sealed it, and addressed it to Frodo. At first he put \\nit on the mantelpiece, but suddenly he removed it and stuck it in his \\npocket. At that moment the door opened and Gandalf came quickly in. \\n\\n\\'Hullo!\\' said Bilbo. \\'I wondered if you would turn up.\\' \\n\\n\\'I am glad to find you visible,\\' replied the wizard, sitting down in a \\nchair, \\'I wanted to catch you and have a few final words. I suppose you feel \\nthat everything has gone off splendidly and according to plan?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, I do,\\' said Bilbo. \"Though that flash was surprising: it quite \\nstartled me, let alone the others. A little addition of your own, I \\nsuppose?\\' \\n\\nIt was. You have wisely kept that ring secret all these years, and it \\nseemed to me necessary to give your guests something else that would seem to \\nexplain your sudden vanishment.\\' \\n\\n\\'And would spoil my joke. You are an interfering old busybody,\\' laughed \\nBilbo, \\'but I expect you know best, as usual.\\' \\n\\n\\'I do - when I know anything. But I don\\'t feel too sure about this \\nwhole affair. It has now come to the final point. You have had your joke, \\nand alarmed or offended most of your relations, and given the whole Shire \\nsomething to talk about for nine days, or ninety-nine more likely. Are you \\ngoing any further?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, I am. I feel I need a holiday, a very long holiday, as I have \\ntold you before. Probably a permanent holiday: I don\\'t expect I shall \\nreturn. In fact, I don\\'t mean to, and I have made all arrangements. \\n\\n\\'I am old, Gandalf. I don\\'t look it, but I am beginning to feel it in \\nmy heart of hearts. Well-preserved indeed!\\' he snorted. \\'Why, I feel all \\nthin, sort of stretched, if you know what I mean: like butter that has been \\nscraped over too much bread. That can\\'t be right. I need a change, or \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsomething.\\' \\n\\nGandalf looked curiously and closely at him. \\'No, it does not seem \\nright,\\' he said thoughtfully. \\'No, after all I believe your plan is probably \\nthe best.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, I\\'ve made up my mind, anyway. I want to see mountains again, \\nGandalf, mountains, and then find somewhere where I can rest. In peace and \\nquiet, without a lot of relatives prying around, and a string of confounded \\nvisitors hanging on the bell. I might find somewhere where I can finish my \\nbook. I have thought of a nice ending for it: and he lived happily ever \\nafter to the end of his days. \\' \\n\\nGandalf laughed. I hope he will. But nobody will read the book, however \\nit ends.\\' \\n\\n\\'Oh, they may, in years to come. Frodo has read some already, as far as \\nit has gone. You\\'ll keep an eye on Frodo, won\\'t you?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, I will - two eyes, as often as I can spare them.\\' \\n\\n\\'He would come with me, of course, if I asked him. In fact he offered \\nto once, just before the party. But he does not really want to, yet. I want \\nto see the wild country again before I die, and the Mountains; but he is \\nstill in love with the Shire, with woods and fields and little rivers. He \\nought to be comfortable here. I am leaving everything to him, of course, \\nexcept a few oddments. I hope he will be happy, when he gets used to being \\non his own. It\\'s time he was his own master now.\\' \\n\\n\\'Everything?\\' said Gandalf. \\'The ring as well? You agreed to that, you \\nremember.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, er, yes, I suppose so,\\' stammered Bilbo. \\n\\n\\'Where is it?\\' \\n\\n\\'In an envelope, if you must know,\\' said Bilbo impatiently. \\'There on \\nthe mantelpiece. Well, no! Here it is in my pocket!\\' He hesitated. \\'Isn\\'t \\nthat odd now?\\' he said softly to himself. \\'Yet after all, why not? Why \\nshouldn\\'t it stay there?\\' \\n\\nGandalf looked again very hard at Bilbo, and there was a gleam in his \\neyes. \\'I think, Bilbo,\\' he said quietly, \\'I should leave it behind. Don\\'t \\nyou want to?\\' \\n\\n\\'Well yes - and no. Now it comes to it, I don\\'t like parting with it at \\nall, I may say. And I don\\'t really see why I should. Why do you want me to?\\' \\nhe asked, and a curious change came over his voice. It was sharp with \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsuspicion and annoyance. \\'You are always badgering me about my ring; but \\nyou \\n\\nhave never bothered me about the other things that I got on my journey.\\' \\n\\n\\'No, but I had to badger you,\\' said Gandalf. \\'I wanted the truth. It \\nwas important. Magic rings are - well, magical; and they are rare and \\ncurious. I was professionally interested in your ring, you may say; and I \\nstill am. I should like to know where it is, if you go wandering again. Also \\nI think you have had it quite long enough. You won\\'t need it any more. \\nBilbo, unless I am quite mistaken.\\' \\n\\nBilbo flushed, and there was an angry light in his eyes. His kindly \\nface grew hard. \\'Why not?\\' he cried. \\'And what business is it of yours, \\nanyway, to know what I do with my own things? It is my own. I found it. It \\ncame to me.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, yes,\\' said Gandalf. \\'But there is no need to get angry.\\' \\n\\n\\'If I am it is your fault,\\' said Bilbo. \\'It is mine, I tell you. My \\nown. My precious. Yes, my precious.\\' \\n\\nThe wizard\\'s face remained grave and attentive, and only a flicker in \\nhis deep eyes showed that he was startled and indeed alarmed. \\'It has been \\ncalled that before,\\' he said, \\'but not by you.\\' \\n\\n\\'But I say it now. And why not? Even if Gollum said the same once. It\\'s \\nnot his now, but mine. And I shall keep it, I say.\\' \\n\\nGandalf stood up. He spoke sternly. \\'You will be a fool if you do. \\n\\nBilbo,\\' he said. \\'You make that clearer with every word you say. It has got \\nfar too much hold on you. Let it go! And then you can go yourself, and be \\nfree.\\' \\n\\n\\'I\\'ll do as I choose and go as I please,\\' said Bilbo obstinately. \\n\\n\\'Now, now, my dear hobbit! \\' said Gandalf. \\'All your long life we have \\nbeen friends, and you owe me something. Come! Do as you promised: give it \\nup! \\' \\n\\n\\'Well, if you want my ring yourself, say so!\\' cried Bilbo. \\'But you \\nwon\\'t get it. I won\\'t give my precious away, I tell you.\\' His hand strayed \\nto the hilt of his small sword. \\n\\nGandalf s eyes flashed. It will be my turn to get angry soon,\\' he said. \\n\\nIf you say that again, I shall. Then you will see Gandalf the Grey \\nuncloaked.\\' He took a step towards the hobbit, and he seemed to grow tall \\nand menacing; his shadow filled the little room. \\n\\nBilbo backed away to the wall, breathing hard, his hand clutching at \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhis pocket. They stood for a while facing one another, and the air of the \\nroom tingled. Gandalf s eyes remained bent on the hobbit. Slowly his hands \\nrelaxed, and he began to tremble. \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know what has come over you, Gandalf,\\' he said. \\'You have \\nnever been like this before. What is it all about? It is mine isn\\'t it? I \\nfound it, and Gollum would have killed me, if I hadn\\'t kept it. I\\'m not a \\nthief, whatever he said.\\' \\n\\n\\'I have never called you one,\\' Gandalf answered. \\'And I am not one \\neither. I am not trying to rob you, but to help you. I wish you would trust \\nme, as you used.\\' He turned away, and the shadow passed. He seemed to \\ndwindle again to an old grey man, bent and troubled. \\n\\nBilbo drew his hand over his eyes. I am sorry,\\' he said. \\'But I felt so \\nqueer. And yet it would be a relief in a way not to be bothered with it any \\nmore. It has been so growing on my mind lately. Sometimes I have felt it was \\nlike an eye looking at me. And I am always wanting to put it on and \\ndisappear, don\\'t you know; or wondering if it is safe, and pulling it out to \\nmake sure. I tried locking it up, but I found I couldn\\'t rest without it in \\nmy pocket. I don\\'t know why. And I don\\'t seem able to make up my mind.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then trust mine,\\' said Gandalf. \\'It is quite made up. Go away and \\nleave it behind. Stop possessing it. Give it to Frodo, and I will look after \\nhim.\\' \\n\\nBilbo stood for a moment tense and undecided. Presently he sighed. \\'All \\nright,\\' he said with an effort. I will.\\' Then he shrugged his shoulders, and \\nsmiled rather ruefully. \\'After all that\\'s what this party business was all \\nabout, really: to give away lots of birthday presents, and somehow make it \\neasier to give it away at the same time. It hasn\\'t made it any easier in the \\nend, but it would be a pity to waste all my preparations. It would quite \\nspoil the joke.\\' \\n\\n\\'Indeed it would take away the only point I ever saw in the affair,\\' \\nsaid Gandalf. \\n\\n\\'Very well,\\' said Bilbo, \\'it goes to Frodo with all the rest.\\' He drew \\na deep breath. \\'And now I really must be starting, or somebody else will \\ncatch me. I have said good-bye, and I couldn\\'t bear to do it all over \\nagain.\\' He picked up his bag and moved to the door. \\n\\n\\'You have still got the ring in your pocket,\\' said the wizard. \\'Well, \\nso I have!\\' cried Bilbo. \\'And my will and all the other documents too. You \\nhad better take it and deliver it for me. That will be safest.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'No, don\\'t give the ring to me,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Put it on the \\nmantelpiece. It will be safe enough there, till Frodo comes. I shall wait \\nfor him.\\' \\n\\nBilbo took out the envelope, but just as he was about to set it by the \\nclock, his hand jerked back, and the packet fell on the floor. Before he \\ncould pick it up, the wizard stooped and seized it and set it in its place. \\n\\nA spasm of anger passed swiftly over the hobbit\\'s face again. Suddenly it \\ngave way to a look of relief and a laugh. \\'Well, that\\'s that,\\' he said. \\'Now \\nI\\'m off!\\' \\n\\nThey went out into the hall. Bilbo chose his favourite stick from the \\nstand; then he whistled. Three dwarves came out of different rooms where \\nthey had been busy. \\n\\n\\'Is everything ready?\\' asked Bilbo. \\'Everything packed and labelled?\\' \\n\\n\\'Everything,\\' they answered. \\n\\n\\'Well, let\\'s start then!\\' He stepped out of the front-door. \\n\\nIt was a fine night, and the black sky was dotted with stars. He looked \\nup, sniffing the air. \\'What fun! What fun to be off again, off on the Road \\nwith dwarves ! This is what I have really been longing for, for years ! \\nGood-bye! \\' he said, looking at his old home and bowing to the door. \\n\\'Good-bye, Gandalf!\\' \\n\\n\\'Good-bye, for the present, Bilbo. Take care of yourself! You are old \\nenough, and perhaps wise enough.\\' \\n\\n\\'Take care! I don\\'t care. Don\\'t you worry about me! I am as happy now \\nas I have ever been, and that is saying a great deal. But the time has come. \\n\\nI am being swept off my feet at last,\\' he added, and then in a low voice, as \\nif to himself, he sang softly in the dark: \\n\\nThe Road goes ever on and on \\n\\nDown from the door where it began. \\n\\nNow far ahead the Road has gone, \\n\\nAnd I must follow, if I can, \\n\\nPursuing it with eager feet, \\n\\nUntil it joins some larger way \\n\\nWhere many paths and errands meet. \\n\\nAnd whither then? I cannot say. \\n\\nHe paused, silent for a moment. Then without another word he turned \\naway from the lights and voices in the fields and tents, and followed by his \\nthree companions went round into his garden, and trotted down the long \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsloping path. He jumped over a low place in the hedge at the bottom, and \\ntook to the meadows, passing into the night like a rustle of wind in the \\ngrass. \\n\\nGandalf remained for a while staring after him into the darkness. \\n\\'Goodbye, my dear Bilbo - until our next meeting!\\' he said softly and went \\nback indoors. \\n\\nFrodo came in soon afterwards, and found him sitting in the dark, deep \\nin thought. \\'Has he gone?\\' he asked. \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' answered Gandalf, \\'he has gone at last.\\' \\n\\n\\' I wish - 1 mean, I hoped until this evening that it was only a joke,\\' \\nsaid Frodo. \\'But I knew in my heart that he really meant to go. He always \\nused to joke about serious things. I wish I had come back sooner, just to \\nsee him off.\\' \\n\\nI think really he preferred slipping off quietly in the end,\\' said \\nGandalf. \\'Don\\'t be too troubled. He\\'ll be all right - now. He left a packet \\nfor you. There it is!\\' \\n\\nFrodo took the envelope from the mantelpiece, and glanced at it, but \\ndid not open it. \\n\\n\\'You\\'ll find his will and all the other documents in there, I think,\\' \\nsaid the wizard. \\'You are the master of Bag End now. And also, I fancy, \\nyou\\'ll find a golden ring.\\' \\n\\n\\'The ring!\\' exclaimed Frodo. \\'Has he left me that? I wonder why. Still, \\nit may be useful.\\' \\n\\n\\'It may, and it may not,\\' said Gandalf. \\'I should not make use of it, \\nif I were you. But keep it secret, and keep it safe! Now I am going to bed.\\' \\n\\nAs master of Bag End Frodo felt it his painful duty to say good-bye to \\nthe guests. Rumours of strange events had by now spread all over the field, \\nbut Frodo would only say no doubt everything will be cleared up in the \\nmorning. About midnight carriages came for the important folk. One by one \\nthey rolled away, filled with full but very unsatisfied hobbits. Gardeners \\ncame by arrangement, and removed in wheel-barrows those that had \\ninadvertently remained behind. \\n\\nNight slowly passed. The sun rose. The hobbits rose rather later. \\nMorning went on. People came and began (by orders) to clear away the \\npavilions and the tables and the chairs, and the spoons and knives and \\nbottles and plates, and the lanterns, and the flowering shrubs in boxes, and \\nthe crumbs and cracker -paper, the forgotten bags and gloves and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhandkerchiefs, and the uneaten food (a very small item). Then a number of \\nother people came (without orders): Bagginses, and Boffins, and Bolgers, and \\nTooks, and other guests that lived or were staying near. By mid-day, when \\neven the best-fed were out and about again, there was a large crowd at Bag \\nEnd, uninvited but not unexpected. \\n\\nFrodo was waiting on the step, smiling, but looking rather tired and \\nworried. He welcomed all the callers, but he had not much more to say than \\nbefore. His reply to all inquiries was simply this: \\'Mr. Bilbo Baggins has \\ngone away; as far as I know, for good.\\' Some of the visitors he invited to \\ncome inside, as Bilbo had left \\'messages\\' for them. \\n\\nInside in the hall there was piled a large assortment of packages and \\nparcels and small articles of furniture. On every item there was a label \\ntied. There were several labels of this sort: \\n\\nFor ADELARD TOOK, for his VERY OWN, from Bilbo, on an umbrella. \\nAdelard \\n\\nhad carried off many unlabelled ones. \\n\\nFor DORA BAGGINS in memory of a LONG correspondence, with love \\nfrom \\n\\nBilbo, on a large waste-paper basket. Dora was Drogo\\'s sister and the eldest \\nsurviving female relative of Bilbo and Frodo; she was ninety-nine, and had \\nwritten reams of good advice for more than half a century. \\n\\nFor MILO BURROWS, hoping it will be useful, from B.B., on a gold pen \\nand ink-bottle. Milo never answered letters. \\n\\nFor ANGELICA\\'S use, from Uncle Bilbo, on a round convex mirror. She \\nwas \\n\\na young Baggins, and too obviously considered her face shapely. \\n\\nFor the collection of HUGO BRACEGIRDLE, from a contributor, on an \\n(empty) book -case. Hugo was a great borrower of books, and worse than usual \\nat returning them. \\n\\nFor LOBELIA SACKVILLE-BAGGINS, as a PRESENT, on a case of \\nsilver \\n\\nspoons. Bilbo believed that she had acquired a good many of his spoons, \\nwhile he was away on his former journey. Fobelia knew that quite well. When \\nshe arrived later in the day, she took the point at once, but she also took \\nthe spoons. \\n\\nThis is only a small selection of the assembled presents. Bilbo\\'s \\nresidence had got rather cluttered up with things in the course of his long \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nlife. It was a tendency of hobbit-holes to get cluttered up: for which the \\ncustom of giving so many birthday-presents was largely responsible. Not, of \\ncourse, that the birthday-presents were always new, there were one or two \\nold mathoms of forgotten uses that had circulated all around the district; \\nbut Bilbo had usually given new presents, and kept those that he received. \\nThe old hole was now being cleared a little. \\n\\nEvery one of the various parting gifts had labels, written out \\npersonally by Bilbo, and several had some point, or some joke. But, of \\ncourse, most of the things were given where they would be wanted and \\nwelcome. The poorer hobbits, and especially those of Bagshot Row, did very \\nwell. Old Gaffer Gamgee got two sacks of potatoes, a new spade, a woollen \\nwaistcoat, and a bottle of ointment for creaking joints. Old Rory \\nBrandybuck, in return for much hospitality, got a dozen bottles of Old \\nWinyards: a strong red wine from the Southfarthing, and now quite mature, as \\nit had been laid down by Bilbo\\'s father. Rory quite forgave Bilbo, and voted \\nhim a capital fellow after the first bottle. \\n\\nThere was plenty of everything left for Frodo. And, of course, all the \\nchief treasures, as well as the books, pictures, and more than enough \\nfurniture, were left in his possession. There was, however, no sign nor \\nmention of money or jewellery: not a penny -piece or a glass bead was given \\naway. \\n\\nFrodo had a very trying time that afternoon. A false rumour that the \\nwhole household was being distributed free spread like wildfire; and before \\nlong the place was packed with people who had no business there, but could \\nnot be kept out. Fabels got torn off and mixed, and quarrels broke out. Some \\npeople tried to do swaps and deals in the hall; and others tried to make off \\nwith minor items not addressed to them, or with anything that seemed \\nunwanted or unwatched. The road to the gate was blocked with barrows and \\nhandcarts. \\n\\nIn the middle of the commotion the Sackville-Bagginses arrived. Frodo \\nhad retired for a while and left his friend Merry Brandybuck to keep an eye \\non things. When Otho loudly demanded to see Frodo, Merry bowed politely. \\n\\n\\'He is indisposed,\\' he said. \\'He is resting.\\' \\n\\n\\'Hiding, you mean,\\' said Fobelia. \\'Anyway we want to see him and we \\nmean to see him. Just go and tell him so!\\' \\n\\nMerry left them a long while in the hall, and they had time to discover \\ntheir parting gift of spoons. It did not improve their tempers. Eventually \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthey were shown into the study. Frodo was sitting at a table with a lot of \\npapers in front of him. He looked indisposed - to see Sackville-Bagginses at \\nany rate; and he stood up, fidgeting with something in his pocket. But he \\nspoke quite politely. \\n\\nThe Sackville-Bagginses were rather offensive. They began by offering \\nhim bad bargain-prices (as between friends) for various valuable and \\nunlabelled things. When Frodo replied that only the things specially \\ndirected by Bilbo were being given away, they said the whole affair was very \\nfishy. \\n\\n\\'Only one thing is clear to me,\\' said Otho, \\'and that is that you are \\ndoing exceedingly well out of it. I insist on seeing the will.\\' \\n\\nOtho would have been Bilbo\\'s heir, but for the adoption of Frodo. He \\nread the will carefully and snorted. It was, unfortunately, very clear and \\ncorrect (according to the legal customs of hobbits, which demand among other \\nthings seven signatures of witnesses in red ink). \\n\\n\\'Foiled again!\\' he said to his wife. \\'And after waiting sixty years. \\n\\nSpoons? Fiddlesticks!\\' He snapped his fingers under Frodo\\'s nose and slumped \\noff. But Lobelia was not so easily got rid of. A little later Frodo came out \\nof the study to see how things were going on and found her still about the \\nplace, investigating nooks and comers and tapping the floors. He escorted \\nher firmly off the premises, after he had relieved her of several small (but \\nrather valuable) articles that had somehow fallen inside her umbrella. Her \\nface looked as if she was in the throes of thinking out a really crushing \\nparting remark; but all she found to say, turning round on the step, was: \\n\\n\\'You\\'ll live to regret it, young fellow! Why didn\\'t you go too? You \\ndon\\'t belong here; you\\'re no Baggins - you - you\\'re a Brandybuck!\\' \\n\\n\\'Did you hear that, Merry? That was an insult, if you like,\\' said Frodo \\nas he shut the door on her. \\n\\n\\'It was a compliment,\\' said Merry Brandybuck, \\'and so, of course, not \\ntrue.\\' \\n\\nThen they went round the hole, and evicted three young hobbits (two \\nBoffins and a Bolger) who were knocking holes in the walls of one of the \\ncellars. Frodo also had a tussle with young Sancho Proudfoot (old Odo \\nProudfoot\\'s grandson), who had begun an excavation in the larger pantry, \\nwhere he thought there was an echo. The legend of Bilbo\\'s gold excited both \\ncuriosity and hope; for legendary gold (mysteriously obtained, if not \\npositively ill-gotten), is, as every one knows, any one\\'s for the finding \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-unless the search is interrupted. \\n\\nWhen he had overcome Sancho and pushed him out, Frodo collapsed on \\nchair in the hall. It\\'s time to close the shop, Merry,\\' he said. \\'Lock the \\ndoor, and don\\'t open it to anyone today, not even if they bring a battering \\nram.\\' Then he went to revive himself with a belated cup of tea. \\n\\nHe had hardly sat down, when there came a soft knock at the front-door. \\n\\'Lobelia again most likely,\\' he thought. \\'She must have thought of something \\nreally nasty, and have come back again to say it. It can wait.\\' \\n\\nHe went on with his tea. The knock was repeated, much louder, but he \\ntook no notice. Suddenly the wizard\\'s head appeared at the window. \\n\\n\\'If you don\\'t let me in, Frodo, I shall blow your door right down your \\nhole and out through the hill,\\' he said. \\n\\n\\'My dear Gandalf! Half a minute!\\' cried Frodo, running out of the room \\nto the door. \\'Come in! Come in! I thought it was Lobelia.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then I forgive you. But I saw her some time ago, driving a pony-trap \\ntowards Bywater with a face that would have curdled new milk.\\' \\n\\n\\'She had already nearly curdled me. Honestly, I nearly tried on Bilbo\\'s \\nring. I longed to disappear.\\' \\n\\n\\'Don\\'t do that!\\' said Gandalf, sitting down. \\'Do be careful of that \\nring, Frodo ! In fact, it is partly about that that I have come to say a last \\nword.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, what about it?\\' \\n\\n\\'What do you know already?\\' \\n\\n\\'Only what Bilbo told me. I have heard his story: how he found it, and \\nhow he used it: on his journey, I mean.\\' \\n\\n\\'Which story, I wonder,\\' said Gandalf. \\n\\n\\'Oh, not what he told the dwarves and put in his book,\\' said Frodo. \\'He \\ntold me the true story soon after I came to live here. He said you had \\npestered him till he told you, so I had better know too. \"No secrets between \\nus, Frodo,\" he said; \"but they are not to go any further. It\\'s mine \\nanyway.\\'\" \\n\\n\\'That\\'s interesting,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Well, what did you think of it \\nall?\\' \\n\\n\\'If you mean, inventing all that about a \"present\", well, I thought the \\ntrue story much more likely, and I couldn\\'t see the point of altering it at \\nall. It was very unlike Bilbo to do so, anyway; and I thought it rather \\nodd.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'So did I. But odd things may happen to people that have such treasures \\n- if they use them. Let it be a warning to you to be very careful with it. \\n\\nIt may have other powers than just making you vanish when you wish to.\\' \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t understand,\\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'Neither do I,\\' answered the wizard. \\'I have merely begun to wonder \\nabout the ring, especially since last night. No need to worry. But if you \\ntake my advice you will use it very seldom, or not at all. At least I beg \\nyou not to use it in any way that will cause talk or rouse suspicion. I say \\nagain: keep it safe, and keep it secret!\\' \\n\\n\\'You are very mysterious! What are you afraid of?\\' \\n\\n\\'I am not certain, so I will say no more. I may be able to tell you \\nsomething when I come back. I am going off at once: so this is good-bye for \\nthe present.\\' He got up. \\n\\n\\'At once!\\' cried Frodo. \\'Why, I thought you were staying on for at \\nleast a week. I was looking forward to your help.\\' \\n\\n\\'I did mean to - but I have had to change my mind. I may be away for a \\ngood while; but I\\'ll come and see you again, as soon as I can. Expect me \\nwhen you see me! I shall slip in quietly. I shan\\'t often be visiting the \\nShire openly again. I find that I have become rather unpopular. They say I \\nam a nuisance and a disturber of the peace. Some people are actually \\naccusing me of spiriting Bilbo away, or worse. If you want to know, there is \\nsupposed to be a plot between you and me to get hold of his wealth.\\' \\n\\n\\'Some people!\\' exclaimed Frodo. \\'You mean Otho and Lobelia. How \\nabominable! I would give them Bag End and everything else, if I could get \\nBilbo back and go off tramping in the country with him. I love the Shire. \\nBut I begin to wish, somehow, that I had gone too. I wonder if I shall ever \\nsee him again.\\' \\n\\n\\'So do I,\\' said Gandalf. \\'And I wonder many other things. Good-bye now! \\nTake care of yourself! Lookout for me, especially at unlikely times ! \\nGood-bye!\\' \\n\\nFrodo saw him to the door. He gave a final wave of his hand, and walked \\noff at a surprising pace; but Frodo thought the old wizard looked unusually \\nbent, almost as if he was carrying a great weight. The evening was closing \\nin, and his cloaked figure quickly vanished into the twilight. Frodo did not \\nsee him again for a long time. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 2 . The Shadow of the Past \\n\\n\\n\\nThe talk did not die down in nine or even ninety -nine days. The second \\ndisappearance of Mr. Bilbo Baggins was discussed in Hobbiton, and indeed all \\nover the Shire, for a year and a day, and was remembered much longer than \\nthat. It became a fireside -story for young hobbits; and eventually Mad \\nBaggins, who used to vanish with a bang and a flash and reappear with bags \\nof jewels and gold, became a favourite character of legend and lived on long \\nafter all the true events were forgotten. \\n\\nBut in the meantime, the general opinion in the neighbourhood was that \\nBilbo, who had always been rather cracked, had at last gone quite mad, and \\nhad run off into the Blue. There he had undoubtedly fallen into a pool or a \\nriver and come to a tragic, but hardly an untimely, end. The blame was \\nmostly laid on Gandalf. \\n\\n\\'If only that dratted wizard will leave young Frodo alone, perhaps \\nhe\\'ll settle down and grow some hobbit-sense,\\' they said. And to all \\nappearance the wizard did leave Frodo alone, and he did settle down, but the \\ngrowth of hobbit-sense was not very noticeable. Indeed, he at once began to \\ncarry on Bilbo\\'s reputation for oddity. He refused to go into mourning; and \\nthe next year he gave a party in honour of Bilbo\\'s hundred-and-twelfth \\nbirthday, which he called Hundred-weight Feast. But that was short of the \\nmark, for twenty guests were invited and there were several meals at which \\nit snowed food and rained drink, as hobbits say. \\n\\nSome people were rather shocked; but Frodo kept up the custom of giving \\nBilbo\\'s Birthday Party year after year until they got used to it. He said \\nthat he did not think Bilbo was dead. When they asked: \\'Where is he then?\\' \\nhe shrugged his shoulders. \\n\\nHe lived alone, as Bilbo had done; but he had a good many friends, \\nespecially among the younger hobbits (mostly descendants of the Old Took) \\nwho had as children been fond of Bilbo and often in and out of Bag End. \\nFolco Boffin and Fredegar Bolger were two of these; but his closest friends \\nwere Peregrin Took (usually called Pippin), and Merry Brandybuck (his real \\nname was Meriadoc, but that was seldom remembered). Frodo went tramping \\nall \\n\\nover the Shire with them; but more often he wandered by himself, and to the \\namazement of sensible folk he was sometimes seen far from home walking in \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe hills and woods under the starlight. Merry and Pippin suspected that he \\nvisited the Elves at times, as Bilbo had done. \\n\\nAs time went on, people began to notice that Frodo also showed signs of \\ngood \\'preservation\\': outwardly he retained the appearance of a robust and \\nenergetic hobbit just out of his tweens. \\'Some folk have all the luck,\\' they \\nsaid; but it was not until Frodo approached the usually more sober age of \\nfifty that they began to think it queer. \\n\\nFrodo himself, after the first shock, found that being his own master \\nand the Mr. Baggins of Bag End was rather pleasant. For some years he was \\nquite happy and did not worry much about the future. But half unknown to \\nhimself the regret that he had not gone with Bilbo was steadily growing. He \\nfound himself wondering at times, especially in the autumn, about the wild \\nlands, and strange visions of mountains that he had never seen came into his \\ndreams. He began to say to himself: \\'Perhaps I shall cross the River myself \\none day.\\' To which the other half of his mind always replied: \\'Not yet.\\' \\n\\nSo it went on, until his forties were running out, and his fiftieth \\nbirthday was drawing near: fifty was a number that he felt was somehow \\nsignificant (or ominous); it was at any rate at that age that adventure had \\nsuddenly befallen Bilbo. Frodo began to feel restless, and the old paths \\nseemed too well-trodden. He looked at maps, and wondered what lay beyond \\ntheir edges: maps made in the Shire showed mostly white spaces beyond its \\nborders. He took to wandering further afield and more often by himself; and \\nMerry and his other friends watched him anxiously. Often he was seen walking \\nand talking with the strange wayfarers that began at this time to appear in \\nthe Shire. \\n\\nThere were rumours of strange things happening in the world outside; \\nand as Gandalf had not at that time appeared or sent any message for several \\nyears, Frodo gathered all the news he could. Elves, who seldom walked in the \\nShire, could now be seen passing westward through the woods in the evening, \\npassing and not returning; but they were leaving Middle-earth and were no \\nlonger concerned with its troubles. There were, however, dwarves on the road \\nin unusual numbers. The ancient East -West Road ran through the Shire to its \\nend at the Grey Havens, and dwarves had always used it on their way to their \\nmines in the Blue Mountains. They were the hobbits\\' chief source of news \\nfrom distant parts - if they wanted any: as a rule dwarves said little and \\nhobbits asked no more. But now Frodo often met strange dwarves of far \\ncountries, seeking refuge in the West. They were troubled, and some spoke in \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhispers of the Enemy and of the Land of Mordor. \\n\\nThat name the hobbits only knew in legends of the dark past, like a \\nshadow in the background of their memories; but it was ominous and \\ndisquieting. It seemed that the evil power in Mirkwood had been driven out \\nby the White Council only to reappear in greater strength in the old \\nstrongholds of Mordor. The Dark Tower had been rebuilt, it was said. From \\nthere the power was spreading far and wide, and away far east and south \\nthere were wars and growing fear. Ores were multiplying again in the \\nmountains. Trolls were abroad, no longer dull-witted, but cunning and armed \\nwith dreadful weapons. And there were murmured hints of creatures more \\nterrible than all these, but they had no name. \\n\\nLittle of all this, of course, reached the ears of ordinary hobbits. \\n\\nBut even the deafest and most stay-at-home began to hear queer tales; and \\nthose whose business took them to the borders saw strange things. The \\nconversation in The Green Dragon at Bywater, one evening in the spring of \\nFrodo\\'s fiftieth year, showed that even in the comfortable heart of the \\nShire rumours had been heard, though most hobbits still laughed at them. \\n\\nSam Gamgee was sitting in one corner near the fire, and opposite him \\nwas Ted Sandyman, the miller\\'s son; and there were various other rustic \\nhobbits listening to their talk. \\n\\n\\'Queer things you do hear these days, to be sure,\\' said Sam. \\n\\n\\'Ah,\\' said Ted, \\'you do, if you listen. But I can hear fireside-tales \\nand children\\'s stories at home, if I want to.\\' \\n\\n\\'No doubt you can,\\' retorted Sam, \\'and I daresay there\\'s more truth in \\nsome of them than you reckon. Who invented the stories anyway? Take \\ndragons \\nnow.\\' \\n\\n\\'No thank \\'ee,\\' said Ted, \\'I won\\'t. I heard tell of them when I was a \\nyoungster, but there\\'s no call to believe in them now. There\\'s only one \\nDragon in By water, and that\\'s Green,\\' he said, getting a general laugh. \\n\\n\\'All right,\\' said Sam, laughing with the rest. \\'But what about these \\nTree-men, these giants, as you might call them? They do say that one bigger \\nthan a tree was seen up away beyond the North Moors not long back.\\' \\n\\n\\'Who\\'s theyT \\n\\n\\'My cousin Hal for one. He works for Mr. Boffin at Overhill and goes up \\nto the Northfarthing for the hunting. He saw one.\\' \\n\\n\\'Says he did, perhaps. Your Hal\\'s always saying he\\'s seen things; and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmaybe he sees things that ain\\'t there.\\' \\n\\n\\'But this one was as big as an elm tree, and walking - walking seven \\nyards to a stride, if it was an inch.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then I bet it wasn\\'t an inch. What he saw was an elm tree, as like as \\nnot.\\' \\n\\n\\'But this one was walking, I tell you; and there ain\\'t no elm tree on \\nthe North Moors.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then Hal can\\'t have seen one,\\' said Ted. There was some laughing and \\nclapping: the audience seemed to think that Ted had scored a point. \\n\\n\\'All the same,\\' said Sam, \\'you can\\'t deny that others besides our \\nHalfast have seen queer folk crossing the Shire - crossing it, mind you: \\nthere are more that are turned back at the borders. The Bounders have never \\nbeen so busy before. \\n\\n\\'And I\\'ve heard tell that Elves are moving west. They do say they are \\ngoing to the harbours, out away beyond the White Towers.\\' Sam waved his \\narm \\n\\nvaguely: neither he nor any of them knew how far it was to the Sea, past the \\nold towers beyond the western borders of the Shire. But it was an old \\ntradition that away over there stood the Grey Havens, from which at times \\nelven-ships set sail, never to return. \\n\\n\\'They are sailing, sailing, sailing over the Sea, they are going into \\nthe West and leaving us,\\' said Sam, half chanting the words, shaking his \\nhead sadly and solemnly. But Ted laughed. \\n\\n\\'Well, that isn\\'t anything new, if you believe the old tales. And I \\ndon\\'t see what it matters to me or you. Let them sail! But I warrant you \\nhaven\\'t seen them doing it; nor any one else in the Shire.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well I don\\'t know,\\' said Sam thoughtfully. He believed he had once \\nseen an Elf in the woods, and still hoped to see more one day. Of all the \\nlegends that he had heard in his early years such fragments of tales and \\nhalf-remembered stories about the Elves as the hobbits knew, had always \\nmoved him most deeply. \\'There are some, even in these parts, as know the \\nFair Folk and get news of them,\\' he said. \\'There\\'s Mr. Baggins now, that I \\nwork for. He told me that they were sailing and he knows a bit about Elves. \\nAnd old Mr. Bilbo knew more: many\\'s the talk I had with him when I was a \\nlittle lad.\\' \\n\\n\\'Oh, they\\'re both cracked,\\' said Ted. \\'Leastways old Bilbo was cracked, \\nand Frodo\\'s cracking. If that\\'s where you get your news from, you\\'ll never \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwant for moonshine. Well, friends, I\\'m off home. Your good health!\\' He \\ndrained his mug and went out noisily. \\n\\nSam sat silent and said no more. He had a good deal to think about. For \\none thing, there was a lot to do up in the Bag End garden, and he would have \\na busy day tomorrow, if the weather cleared. The grass was growing fast. But \\nSam had more on his mind than gardening. After a while he sighed, and got up \\nand went out. \\n\\nIt was early April and the sky was now clearing after heavy rain. The \\nsun was down, and a cool pale evening was quietly fading into night. He \\nwalked home under the early stars through Hobbiton and up the Hill, \\nwhistling softly and thoughtfully. \\n\\nIt was just at this time that Gandalf reappeared after his long \\nabsence. For three years after the Party he had been away. Then he paid \\nFrodo a brief visit, and after taking a good look at him he went off again. \\nDuring the next year or two he had turned up fairly often, coming \\nunexpectedly after dusk, and going off without warning before sunrise. He \\nwould not discuss his own business and journeys, and seemed chiefly \\ninterested in small news about Frodo\\'s health and doings. \\n\\nThen suddenly his visits had ceased. It was over nine years since Frodo \\nhad seen or heard of him, and he had begun to think that the wizard would \\nnever return and had given up all interest in hobbits. But that evening, as \\nSam was walking home and twilight was fading, there came the once familiar \\ntap on the study window. \\n\\nFrodo welcomed his old friend with surprise and great delight. They \\nlooked hard at one another. \\n\\n\\'Ah well eh?\\' said Gandalf. \\'You look the same as ever, Frodo!\\' \\n\\n\\'So do you,\\' Frodo replied; but secretly he thought that Gandalf looked \\nolder and more careworn. He pressed him for news of himself and of the wide \\nworld, and soon they were deep in talk, and they stayed up far into the \\nnight. \\n\\nNext morning after a late breakfast, the wizard was sitting with Frodo \\nby the open window of the study. A bright fire was on the hearth, but the \\nsun was warm, and the wind was in the South. Everything looked fresh, and \\nthe new green of Spring was shimmering in the fields and on the tips of the \\ntrees\\' fingers. \\n\\nGandalf was thinking of a spring, nearly eighty years before, when \\nBilbo had run out of Bag End without a handkerchief. His hair was perhaps \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhiter than it had been then, and his beard and eyebrows were perhaps \\nlonger, and his face more lined with care and wisdom; but his eyes were as \\nbright as ever, and he smoked and blew smoke -rings with the same vigour and \\ndelight. \\n\\nHe was smoking now in silence, for Frodo was sitting still, deep in \\nthought. Even in the light of morning he felt the dark shadow of the tidings \\nthat Gandalf had brought. At last he broke the silence. \\n\\n\\'Last night you began to tell me strange things about my ring, \\n\\nGandalf,\\' he said. \\'And then you stopped, because you said that such matters \\nwere best left until daylight. Don\\'t you think you had better finish now? \\n\\nYou say the ring is dangerous, far more dangerous than I guess. In what \\nway?\\' \\n\\n\\'In many ways,\\' answered the wizard. It is far more powerful than I \\never dared to think at first, so powerful that in the end it would utterly \\novercome anyone of mortal race who possessed it. It would possess him. \\n\\n\\'In Eregion long ago many Elven-rings were made, magic rings as you \\ncall them, and they were, of course, of various kinds: some more potent and \\nsome less. The lesser rings were only essays in the craft before it was \\nfull-grown, and to the Elven-smiths they were but trifles - yet still to my \\nmind dangerous for mortals. But the Great Rings, the Rings of Power, they \\nwere perilous. \\n\\n\\'A mortal, Frodo, who keeps one of the Great Rings, does not die, but \\nhe does not grow or obtain more life, he merely continues, until at last \\nevery minute is a weariness. And if he often uses the Ring to make himself \\ninvisible, he fades: he becomes in the end invisible permanently, and walks \\nin the twilight under the eye of the dark power that rules the Rings. Yes, \\nsooner or later - later, if he is strong or well-meaning to begin with, but \\nneither strength nor good purpose will last - sooner or later the dark power \\nwill devour him.\\' \\n\\n\\'How terrifying!\\' said Frodo. There was another long silence. The sound \\nof Sam Gamgee cutting the lawn came in from the garden. \\n\\n\\'How long have you known this?\\' asked Frodo at length. \\'And how much \\ndid Bilbo know?\\' \\n\\n\\'Bilbo knew no more than he told you, I am sure,\\' said Gandalf. \\'He \\nwould certainly never have passed on to you anything that he thought would \\nbe a danger, even though I promised to look after you. He thought the ring \\nwas very beautiful, and very useful at need; and if anything was wrong or \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nqueer, it was himself. He said that it was \"growing on his mind\", and he was \\nalways worrying about it; but he did not suspect that the ring itself was to \\nblame. Though he had found out that the thing needed looking after; it did \\nnot seem always of the same size or weight; it shrank or expanded in an odd \\nway, and might suddenly slip off a finger where it had been tight.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, he warned me of that in his last letter,\\' said Frodo, \\'so I have \\nalways kept it on its chain.\\' \\n\\n\\'Very wise,\\' said Gandalf. \\'But as for his long life, Bilbo never \\nconnected it with the ring at all. He took all the credit for that to \\nhimself, and he was very proud of it. Though he was getting restless and \\nuneasy. Thin and stretched he said. A sign that the ring was getting \\ncontrol.\\' \\n\\n\\'How long have you known all this?\\' asked Frodo again. \\n\\n\\'Known?\\' said Gandalf. \\'I have known much that only the Wise know, \\nFrodo. But if you mean \"known about this ring\", well, I still do not know, \\none might say. There is a last test to make. But I no longer doubt my guess. \\n\\n\\'When did I first begin to guess?\\' he mused, searching back in memory. \\n\\n\\'Let me see - it was in the year that the White Council drove the dark power \\nfrom Mirkwood, just before the Battle of Five Armies, that Bilbo found his \\nring. A shadow fell on my heart then, though I did not know yet what I \\nfeared. I wondered often how Gollum came by a Great Ring, as plainly it was \\n- that at least was clear from the first. Then I heard Bilbo\\'s strange story \\nof how he had \"won\" it, and I could not believe it. When I at last got the \\ntruth out of him, I saw at once that he had been trying to put his claim to \\nthe ring beyond doubt. Much like Gollum with his \"birthday present\". The \\nlies were too much alike for my comfort. Clearly the ring had an unwholesome \\npower that set to work on its keeper at once. That was the first real \\nwarning I had that all was not well. I told Bilbo often that such rings were \\nbetter left unused; but he resented it, and soon got angry. There was little \\nelse that I could do. I could not take it from him without doing greater \\nharm; and I had no right to do so anyway. I could only watch and wait. I \\nmight perhaps have consulted Saruman the White, but something always held \\nme \\nback.\\' \\n\\n\\'Who is he?\\' asked Frodo. I have never heard of him before.\\' \\n\\n\\'Maybe not,\\' answered Gandalf. \\'Hobbits are, or were, no concern of \\nhis. Yet he is great among the Wise. He is the chief of my order and the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhead of the Council. His knowledge is deep, but his pride has grown with it, \\nand he takes ill any meddling. The lore of the Elven-rings, great and small, \\nis his province. He has long studied it, seeking the lost secrets of their \\nmaking; but when the Rings were debated in the Council, all that he would \\nreveal to us of his ring-lore told against my fears. So my doubt slept - but \\nuneasily. Still I watched and I waited. \\n\\n\\'And all seemed well with Bilbo. And the years passed. Yes, they \\npassed, and they seemed not to touch him. He showed no signs of age. The \\nshadow fell on me again. But I said to myself: \"After all he comes of a \\nlong-lived family on his mother\\'s side. There is time yet. Wait!\" \\n\\n\\'And I waited. Until that night when he left this house. He said and \\ndid things then that filled me with a fear that no words of Saruman could \\nallay. I knew at last that something dark and deadly was at work. And I have \\nspent most of the years since then in finding out the truth of it.\\' \\n\\n\\'There wasn\\'t any permanent harm done, was there?\\' asked Frodo \\nanxiously. \\'He would get all right in time, wouldn\\'t he? Be able to rest in \\npeace, I mean?\\' \\n\\n\\'He felt better at once,\\' said Gandalf. \\'But there is only one Power in \\nthis world that knows all about the Rings and their effects; and as far as I \\nknow there is no Power in the world that knows all about hobbits. Among the \\nWise I am the only one that goes in for hobbit-lore: an obscure branch of \\nknowledge, but full of surprises. Soft as butter they can be, and yet \\nsometimes as tough as old tree-roots. I think it likely that some would \\nresist the Rings far longer than most of the Wise would believe. I don\\'t \\nthink you need worry about Bilbo. \\n\\n\\'Of course, he possessed the ring for many years, and used it, so it \\nmight take a long while for the influence to wear off - before it was safe \\nfor him to see it again, for instance. Otherwise, he might live on for \\nyears, quite happily: just stop as he was when he parted with it. For he \\ngave it up in the end of his own accord: an important point. No, I was not \\ntroubled about dear Bilbo any more, once he had let the thing go. It is for \\nyou that I feel responsible. \\n\\n\\'Ever since Bilbo left I have been deeply concerned about you, and \\nabout all these charming, absurd, helpless hobbits. It would be a grievous \\nblow to the world, if the Dark Power overcame the Shire; if all your kind, \\njolly, stupid Bolgers, Hornblowers, Boffins, Bracegirdles, and the rest, not \\nto mention the ridiculous Bagginses, became enslaved.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrodo shuddered. \\'But why should we be?\\' he asked. \\'And why should he \\nwant such slaves?\\' \\n\\n\\'To tell you the truth,\\' replied Gandalf, \\'I believe that hitherto - \\nhitherto, mark you - he has entirely overlooked the existence of hobbits. \\n\\nYou should be thankful. But your safety has passed. He does not need you - \\nhe has many more useful servants - but he won\\'t forget you again. And \\nhobbits as miserable slaves would please him far more than hobbits happy and \\nfree. There is such a thing as malice and revenge.\\' \\n\\n\\'Revenge?\\' said Frodo. \\'Revenge for what? I still don\\'t understand what \\nall this has to do with Bilbo and myself, and our ring.\\' \\n\\n\\'It has everything to do with it,\\' said Gandalf. \\'You do not know the \\nreal peril yet; but you shall. I was not sure of it myself when I was last \\nhere; but the time has come to speak. Give me the ring for a moment.\\' \\n\\nFrodo took it from his breeches-pocket, where it was clasped to a chain \\nthat hung from his belt. He unfastened it and handed it slowly to the \\nwizard. It felt suddenly very heavy, as if either it or Frodo himself was in \\nsome way reluctant for Gandalf to touch it. \\n\\nGandalf held it up. It looked to be made of pure and solid gold. \\'Can \\nyou see any markings on it?\\' he asked. \\n\\n\\'No,\\' said Frodo. \\'There are none. It is quite plain, and it never \\nshows a scratch or sign of wear.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well then, look!\\' To Frodo\\'s astonishment and distress the wizard \\nthrew it suddenly into the middle of a glowing corner of the fire. Frodo \\ngave a cry and groped for the tongs; but Gandalf held him back. \\n\\n\\'Wait!\\' he said in a commanding voice, giving Frodo a quick look from \\nunder his bristling brows. \\n\\nNo apparent change came over the ring. After a while Gandalf got up, \\nclosed the shutters outside the window, and drew the curtains. The room \\nbecame dark and silent, though the clack of Sam\\'s shears, now nearer to the \\nwindows, could still be heard faintly from the garden. For a moment the \\nwizard stood looking at the fire; then he stooped and removed the ring to \\nthe hearth with the tongs, and at once picked it up. Frodo gasped. \\n\\nIt is quite cool,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Take it!\\' Frodo received it on his \\nshrinking palm: it seemed to have become thicker and heavier than ever. \\n\\n\\'Hold it up!\\' said Gandalf. \\'And look closely!\\' \\n\\nAs Frodo did so, he now saw fine lines, finer than the finest \\npen-strokes, running along the ring, outside and inside: lines of fire that \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nseemed to form the letters of a flowing script. They shone piercingly \\nbright, and yet remote, as if out of a great depth. \\n\\nI cannot read the fiery letters,\\' said Frodo in a quavering voice. \\n\\n\\'No,\\' said Gandalf, \\'but I can. The letters are Elvish, of an ancient \\nmode, but the language is that of Mordor, which I will not utter here. But \\nthis in the Common Tongue is what is said, close enough: \\n\\nOne Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, \\n\\nOne Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them. \\n\\nIt is only two lines of a verse long known in Elven-lore: \\n\\nThree Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky, \\n\\nSeven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone, \\n\\nNine for Mortal Men doomed to die, \\n\\nOne for the Dark Lord on his dark throne \\nIn the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie. \\n\\nOne Ring to rule them all. One Ring to find them, \\n\\nOne Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them \\nIn the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie. \\' \\n\\nHe paused, and then said slowly in a deep voice: \\'This is the \\nMaster -ring, the One Ring to rule them all. This is the One Ring that he \\nlost many ages ago, to the great weakening of his power. He greatly desires \\nit - but he must not get it.\\' \\n\\nFrodo sat silent and motionless. Fear seemed to stretch out a vast \\nhand, like a dark cloud rising in the East and looming up to engulf him. \\n\\'This ring!\\' he stammered. \\'How, how on earth did it come to me?\\' \\n\\n\\'Ah!\\' said Gandalf. \\'That is a very long story. The beginnings lie back \\nin the Black Years, which only the lore-masters now remember. If I were to \\ntell you all that tale, we should still be sitting here when Spring had \\npassed into Winter. \\n\\n\\'But last night I told you of Sauron the Great, the Dark Lord. The \\nrumours that you have heard are true: he has indeed arisen again and left \\nhis hold in Mirkwood and returned to his ancient fastness in the Dark Tower \\nof Mordor. That name even you hobbits have heard of, like a shadow on the \\nborders of old stories. Always after a defeat and a respite, the Shadow \\ntakes another shape and grows again.\\' \\n\\n\\'I wish it need not have happened in my time,\\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'So do I,\\' said Gandalf, \\'and so do all who live to see such times. But \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthat is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the \\ntime that is given, us. And already, Frodo, our time is beginning to look \\nblack. The Enemy is fast becoming very strong. His plans are far from ripe, \\n\\nI think, but they are ripening. We shall be hard put to it. We should be \\nvery hard put to it, even if it were not for this dreadful chance. \\n\\n\\'The Enemy still lacks one thing to give him strength and knowledge to \\nbeat down all resistance, break the last defences, and cover all the lands \\nin a second darkness. He lacks the One Ring. \\n\\n\\'The Three, fairest of all, the Elf-lords hid from him, and his hand \\nnever touched them or sullied them. Seven the Dwarf-kings possessed, but \\nthree he has recovered, and the others the dragons have consumed. Nine he \\ngave to Mortal Men, proud and great, and so ensnared them. Long ago they \\nfell under the dominion of the One, and they became Ringwraiths, shadows \\nunder his great Shadow, his most terrible servants. Long ago. It is many a \\nyear since the Nine walked abroad. Yet who knows? As the Shadow grows \\nonce \\n\\nmore, they too may walk again. But come! We will not speak of such things \\neven in the morning of the Shire. \\n\\n\\'So it is now: the Nine he has gathered to himself; the Seven also, or \\nelse they are destroyed. The Three are hidden still. But that no longer \\ntroubles him. He only needs the One; for he made that Ring himself, it is \\nhis, and he let a great part of his own former power pass into it, so that \\nhe could rule all the others. If he recovers it, then he will command them \\nall again, wherever they be, even the Three, and all that has been wrought \\nwith them will be laid bare, and he will be stronger than ever. \\n\\n\\'And this is the dreadful chance, Frodo. He believed that the One had \\nperished; that the Elves had destroyed it, as should have been done. But he \\nknows now that it has not perished, that it has been found. So he is seeking \\nit, seeking it, and all his thought is bent on it. It is his great hope and \\nour great fear.\\' \\n\\n\\'Why, why wasn\\'t it destroyed?\\' cried Frodo. \\'And how did the Enemy \\never come to lose it, if he was so strong, and it was so precious to him?\\' \\n\\nHe clutched the Ring in his hand, as if he saw already dark fingers \\nstretching out to seize it. \\n\\n\\'It was taken from him,\\' said Gandalf. \\'The strength of the Elves to \\nresist him was greater long ago; and not all Men were estranged from them. \\nThe Men of Westernesse came to their aid. That is a chapter of ancient \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhistory which it might be good to recall; for there was sorrow then too, and \\ngathering dark, but great valour, and great deeds that were not wholly vain. \\n\\nOne day, perhaps, I will tell you all the tale, or you shall hear it told in \\nfull by one who knows it best. \\n\\n\\'But for the moment, since most of all you need to know how this thing \\ncame to you, and that will be tale enough, this is all that I will say. It \\nwas Gil-galad, Elven-king and Elendil of Westernesse who overthrew Sauron, \\nthough they themselves perished in the deed; and Isildur Elendil\\'s son cut \\nthe Ring from Sauron\\'s hand and took it for his own. Then Sauron was \\nvanquished and his spirit fled and was hidden for long years, until his \\nshadow took shape again in Mirkwood. \\n\\n\\'But the Ring was lost. It fell into the Great River, Anduin, and \\nvanished. For Isildur was marching north along the east banks of the River, \\nand near the Gladden Fields he was waylaid by the Ores of the Mountains, and \\nalmost all his folk were slain. He leaped into the waters, but the Ring \\nslipped from his finger as he swam, and then the Ores saw him and killed him \\nwith arrows.\\' \\n\\nGandalf paused. \\'And there in the dark pools amid the Gladden Fields,\\' \\nhe said, \\'the Ring passed out of knowledge and legend; and even so much of \\nits history is known now only to a few, and the Council of the Wise could \\ndiscover no more. But at last I can carry on the story, I think. \\n\\n\\'Fong after, but still very long ago, there lived by the banks of the \\nGreat River on the edge of Wilderland a clever -handed and quiet-footed \\nlittle people. I guess they were of hobbit -kind; akin to the fathers of the \\nfathers of the Stoors, for they loved the River, and often swam in it, or \\nmade little boats of reeds. There was among them a family of high repute, \\nfor it was large and wealthier than most, and it was ruled by a grandmother \\nof the folk, stern and wise in old lore, such as they had. The most \\ninquisitive and curious-minded of that family was called Smjagol. He was \\ninterested in roots and beginnings; he dived into deep pools; he burrowed \\nunder trees and growing plants; he tunnelled into green mounds; and he \\nceased to look up at the hill-tops, or the leaves on trees, or the flowers \\nopening in the air: his head and his eyes were downward. \\n\\n\\'He had a friend called Djagol, of similar sort, sharper -eyed but not \\nso quick and strong. On a time they took a boat and went down to the Gladden \\nFields, where there were great beds of iris and flowering reeds. There \\nSmjagol got out and went nosing about the banks but Deal sat in the boat and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfished. Suddenly a great fish took his hook, and before he knew where he \\nwas, he was dragged out and down into the water, to the bottom. Then he let \\ngo of his line, for he thought he saw something shining in the river-bed; \\nand holding his breath he grabbed at it. \\n\\n\\'Then up he came spluttering, with weeds in his hair and a handful of \\nmud; and he swam to the bank. And behold! when he washed the mud away, \\nthere \\n\\nin his hand lay a beautiful golden ring; and it shone and glittered in the \\nsun, so that his heart was glad. But Smjagol had been watching him from \\nbehind a tree, and as Deal gloated over the ring, Smjagol came softly up \\nbehind. \\n\\n\"\\'Give us that, Deal, my love,\" said Smjagol, over his friend\\'s \\nshoulder. \\n\\n\\'\"Why?\" said Deal. \\n\\n\\' \"Because it\\'s my birthday, my love, and I wants it,\" said Smjagol. \\n\\n\\'\"I don\\'t care,\" said Deal. \"I have given you a present already, more \\nthan I could afford. I found this, and I\\'m going to keep it.\" \\n\\n\\' \"Oh, are you indeed, my love,\" said Smjagol; and he caught Deal by \\nthe throat and strangled him, because the gold looked so bright and \\nbeautiful. Then he put the ring on his finger. \\n\\n\\'No one ever found out what had become of Deal; he was murdered far \\nfrom home, and his body was cunningly hidden. But Smjagol returned alone; \\nand he found that none of his family could see him, when he was wearing the \\nring. He was very pleased with his discovery and he concealed it; and he \\nused it to find out secrets, and he put his knowledge to crooked and \\nmalicious uses. He became sharp-eyed and keen-eared for all that was \\nhurtful. The ring had given him power according to his stature. It is not to \\nbe wondered at that he became very unpopular and was shunned (when \\nvisible) \\n\\nby all his relations. They kicked him, and he bit their feet. He took to \\nthieving, and going about muttering to himself, and gurgling in his throat. \\n\\nSo they called him Gollum, and cursed him, and told him to go far away; and \\nhis grandmother, desiring peace, expelled him from the family and turned him \\nout of her hole. \\n\\n\\'He wandered in loneliness, weeping a little for the hardness of the \\nworld, and he journeyed up the River, till he came to a stream that flowed \\ndown from the mountains, and he went that way. He caught fish in deep pools \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwith invisible fingers and ate them raw. One day it was very hot, and as he \\nwas bending over a pool, he felt a burning on the back of his head) and a \\ndazzling light from the water pained his wet eyes. He wondered at it, for he \\nhad almost forgotten about the Sun. Then for the last time he looked up and \\nshook his fist at her. \\n\\n\\'But as he lowered his eyes, he saw far above the tops of the Misty \\nMountains, out of which the stream came. And he thought suddenly: \"It would \\nbe cool and shady under those mountains. The Sun could not watch me there. \\nThe roots of those mountains must be roots indeed; there must be great \\nsecrets buried there which have not been discovered since the beginning.\" \\n\\n\\'So he journeyed by night up into the highlands, and he found a little \\ncave out of which the dark stream ran; and he wormed his way like a maggot \\ninto the heart of the hills, and vanished out of all knowledge. The Ring \\nwent into the shadows with him, and even the maker, when his power had \\nbegun \\n\\nto grow again, could learn nothing of it.\\' \\n\\n\\'Gollum!\\' cried Frodo. \\'Gollum? Do you mean that this is the very \\nGollum-creature that Bilbo met? How loathsome!\\' \\n\\n\\'I think it is a sad story,\\' said the wizard, \\'and it might have \\nhappened to others, even to some hobbits that I have known.\\' \\n\\n\\'I can\\'t believe that Gollum was connected with hobbits, however \\ndistantly,\\' said Frodo with some heat. \\'What an abominable notion!\\' \\n\\n\\'It is true all the same,\\' replied Gandalf. \\'About their origins, at \\nany rate, I know more than hobbits do themselves. And even Bilbo\\'s story \\nsuggests the kinship. There was a great deal in the background of their \\nminds and memories that was very similar. They understood one another \\nremarkably well, very much better than a hobbit would understand, say, a \\nDwarf, or an Ore, or even an Elf. Think of the riddles they both knew, for \\none thing.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Frodo. \\'Though other folks besides hobbits ask riddles, and \\nof much the same sort. And hobbits don\\'t cheat. Gollum meant to cheat all \\nthe time. He was just trying to put poor Bilbo off his guard. And I daresay \\nit amused his wickedness to start a game which might end in providing him \\nwith an easy victim, but if he lost would not hurt him.\\' \\n\\n\\'Only too true, I fear,\\' said Gandalf. \\'But there was something else in \\nit, I think, which you don\\'t see yet. Even Gollum was not wholly ruined. He \\nhad proved tougher than even one of the Wise would have guessed -as a hobbit \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmight. There was a little corner of his mind that was still his own, and \\nlight came through it, as through a chink in the dark: light out of the \\npast. It was actually pleasant, I think, to hear a kindly voice again, \\nbringing up memories of wind, and trees, and sun on the grass, and such \\nforgotten things. \\n\\n\\'But that, of course, would only make the evil part of him angrier in \\nthe end - unless it could be conquered. Unless it could be cured.\\' Gandalf \\nsighed. \\'Alas! there is little hope of that for him. Yet not no hope. No, \\nnot though he possessed the Ring so long, almost as far back as he can \\nremember. For it was long since he had worn it much: in the black darkness \\nit was seldom needed. Certainly he had never \"faded\". He is thin and tough \\nstill. But the thing was eating up his mind, of course, and the torment had \\nbecome almost unbearable. \\n\\n\\'All the \"great secrets\" under the mountains had turned out to be just \\nempty night: there was nothing more to find out, nothing worth doing, only \\nnasty furtive eating and resentful remembering. He was altogether wretched. \\nHe hated the dark, and he hated light more: he hated everything, and the \\nRing most of all.\\' \\n\\n\\'What do you mean?\\' said Frodo. \\'Surely the Ring was his precious and \\nthe only thing he cared for? But if he hated it, why didn\\'t he get rid of \\nit, or go away and leave it?\\' \\n\\n\\'You ought to begin to understand, Frodo, after all you have heard,\\' \\nsaid Gandalf. \\'He hated it and loved it, as he hated and loved himself. He \\ncould not get rid of it. He had no will left in the matter. \\n\\n\\'A Ring of Power looks after itself, Frodo. It may slip off \\ntreacherously, but its keeper never abandons it. At most he plays with the \\nidea of handing it on to someone else\\'s care - and that only at an early \\nstage, when it first begins to grip. But as far as I know Bilbo alone in \\nhistory has ever gone beyond playing, and really done it. He needed all my \\nhelp, too. And even so he would never have just forsaken it, or cast it \\naside. It was not Gollum, Frodo, but the Ring itself that decided things. \\n\\nThe Ring left him. \\' \\n\\n\\'What, just in time to meet Bilbo?\\' said Frodo. \\'Wouldn\\'t an Ore have \\nsuited it better?\\' \\n\\n\\'It is no laughing matter,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Not for you. It was the \\nstrangest event in the whole history of the Ring so far: Bilbo\\'s arrival \\njust at that time, and putting his hand on it, blindly, in the dark. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'There was more than one power at work, Frodo. The Ring was trying to \\nget back to its master. It had slipped from Isildur\\'s hand and betrayed him; \\nthen when a chance came it caught poor Deal, and he was murdered; and after \\nthat Gollum, and it had devoured him. It could make no further use of him: \\nhe was too small and mean; and as long as it stayed with him he would never \\nleave his deep pool again. So now, when its master was awake once more and \\nsending out his dark thought from Mirkwood, it abandoned Gollum. Only to \\nbe \\n\\npicked up by the most unlikely person imaginable: Bilbo from the Shire! \\n\\n\\'Behind that there was something else at work, beyond any design of the \\nRing-maker. I can put it no plainer than by saying that Bilbo was meant to \\nfind the Ring, and not by its maker. In which case you also were meant to \\nhave it. And that maybe an encouraging thought.\\' \\n\\nIt is not,\\' said Frodo. \"Though I am not sure that I understand you. \\n\\nBut how have you learned all this about the Ring, and about Gollum? Do you \\nreally know it all, or are you just guessing still?\\' \\n\\nGandalf looked at Frodo, and his eyes glinted. I knew much and I have \\nlearned much,\\' he answered. \\'But I am not going to give an account of all my \\ndoings to you. The history of Elendil and Isildur and the One Ring is known \\nto all the Wise. Your ring is shown to be that One Ring by the fire- writing \\nalone, apart from any other evidence.\\' \\'And when did you discover that?\\' \\nasked Frodo, interrupting. \\'Just now in this room, of course,\\' answered the \\nwizard sharply. \\'But I expected to find it. I have come back from dark \\njourneys and long search to make that final test. It is the last proof, and \\nall is now only too clear. Making out Gollum\\'s part, and fitting it into the \\ngap in the history, required some thought. I may have started with guesses \\nabout Gollum, but I am not guessing now. I know. I have seen him.\\' \\n\\n\\'You have seen Gollum?\\' exclaimed Frodo in amazement. \\n\\n\\'Yes. The obvious thing to do, of course, if one could. I tried long \\nago; but I have managed it at last.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then what happened after Bilbo escaped from him? Do you know that?\\' \\n\\n\\'Not so clearly. What I have told you is what Gollum was willing to \\ntell - though not, of course, in the way I have reported it. Gollum is a \\nliar, and you have to sift his words. For instance, he called the Ring his \\n\"birthday present\", and he stuck to that. He said it came from his \\ngrandmother, who had lots of beautiful things of that kind. A ridiculous \\nstory. I have no doubt that Smjagol\\'s grandmother was a matriarch, a great \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nperson in her way, but to talk of her possessing many Elven-rings was \\nabsurd, and as for giving them away, it was a lie. But a lie with a grain of \\ntruth. \\n\\n\\'The murder of Deal haunted Gollum, and he had made up a defence, \\nrepeating it to his \"precious\" over and over again, as he gnawed bones in \\nthe dark, until he almost believed it. It was his birthday. Deal ought to \\nhave given the ring to him. It had previously turned up just so as to be a \\npresent. It was his birthday present, and so on, and on. \\n\\nI endured him as long as I could, but the truth was desperately \\nimportant, and in the end I had to be harsh. I put the fear of fire on him, \\nand wrung the true story out of him, bit by bit, together with much \\nsnivelling and snarling. He thought he was misunderstood and ill-used. But \\nwhen he had at last told me his history, as far as the end of the \\nRiddle-game and Bilbo\\'s escape, he would not say any more, except in dark \\nhints. Some other fear was on him greater than mine. He muttered that he was \\ngoing to gel his own back. People would see if he would stand being kicked, \\nand driven into a hole and then robbed. Gollum had good friends now, good \\nfriends and very strong. They would help him. Baggins would pay for it. That \\nwas his chief thought. He hated Bilbo and cursed his name. What is more, he \\nknew where he came from.\\' \\n\\n\\'But how did he find that out?\\' asked Frodo. \\n\\n\\'Well, as for the name, Bilbo very foolishly told Gollum himself; and \\nafter that it would not be difficult to discover his country, once Gollum \\ncame out. Oh yes, he came out. His longing for the Ring proved stronger than \\nhis fear of the Ores, or even of the light. After a year or two he left the \\nmountains. You see, though still bound by desire of it, the Ring was no \\nlonger devouring him; he began to revive a little. He felt old, terribly \\nold, yet less timid, and he was mortally hungry. \\n\\n\\'Light, light of Sun and Moon, he still feared and hated, and he always \\nwill, I think; but he was cunning. He found he could hide from daylight and \\nmoonshine, and make his way swiftly and softly by dead of night with his \\npale cold eyes, and catch small frightened or unwary things. He grew \\nstronger and bolder with new food and new air. He found his way into \\nMirkwood, as one would expect.\\' \\n\\n\\'Is that where you found him?\\' asked Frodo. \\n\\n\\'I saw him there,\\' answered Gandalf, \\'but before that he had wandered \\nfar, following Bilbo\\'s trail. It was difficult to learn anything from him \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfor certain, for his talk was constantly interrupted by curses and threats. \\n\\n\"What had it got in its pocketses?\" he said. \"It wouldn\\'t say, no precious. \\n\\nLittle cheat. Not a fair question. It cheated first, it did. It broke the \\nrules. We ought to have squeezed it, yes precious. And we will, precious!\" \\n\\n\\'That is a sample of his talk. I don\\'t suppose you want any more. I had \\nweary days of it. But from hints dropped among the snarls I even gathered \\nthat his padding feet had taken him at last to Esgaroth, and even to the \\nstreets of Dale, listening secretly and peering. Well, the news of the great \\nevents went far and wide in Wilderland, and many had heard Bilbo\\'s name and \\nknew where he came from. We had made no secret of our return journey to his \\nhome in the West. Gollum\\'s sharp ears would soon learn what he wanted.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then why didn\\'t he track Bilbo further?\\' asked Frodo. \\'Why didn\\'t he \\ncome to the Shire?\\' \\n\\n\\'Ah,\\' said Gandalf, \\'now we come to it. I think Gollum tried to. He set \\nout and came back westward, as far as the Great River. But then he turned \\naside. He was not daunted by the distance, I am sure. No, something else \\ndrew him away. So my friends think, those that hunted him for me. \\n\\n\\'The Wood -elves tracked him first, an easy task for them, for his trail \\nwas still fresh then. Through Mirkwood and back again it led them, though \\nthey never caught him. The wood was full of the rumour of him, dreadful \\ntales even among beasts and birds. The Woodmen said that there was some \\nnew \\n\\nterror abroad, a ghost that drank blood. It climbed trees to find nests; it \\ncrept into holes to find the young; it slipped through windows to find \\ncradles. \\n\\n\\'But at the western edge of Mirkwood the trail turned away. It wandered \\noff southwards and passed out of the Wood-elves\\' ken, and was lost. And then \\nI made a great mistake. Yes, Frodo, and not the first; though I fear it may \\nprove the worst. I let the matter be. I let him go; for I had much else to \\nthink of at that time, and I still trusted the lore of Saruman. \\n\\n\\'Well, that was years ago. I have paid for it since with many dark and \\ndangerous days. The trail was long cold when I took it up again, after Bilbo \\nleft here. And my search would have been in vain, but for the help that I \\nhad from a friend: Aragorn, the greatest traveller and huntsman of this age \\nof the world. Together we sought for Gollum down the whole length of \\nWilderland, without hope, and without success. But at last, when I had given \\nup the chase and turned to other parts, Gollum was found. My friend returned \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nout of the great perils bringing the miserable creature with him. \\n\\n\\'What he had been doing he would not say. He only wept and called us \\ncruel, with many a gollum in his throat; and when we pressed him he whined \\nand cringed, and rubbed his long hands, licking his fingers as if they \\npained him, as if he remembered some old torture. But I am afraid there is \\nno possible doubt: he had made his slow, sneaking way, step by step, mile by \\nmile, south, down at last to the Land of Mordor.\\' \\n\\nA heavy silence fell in the room. Frodo could hear his heart beating. \\n\\nEven outside everything seemed still. No sound of Sam\\'s shears could now be \\nheard. \\n\\n\\'Yes, to Mordor,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Alas! Mordor draws all wicked things, \\nand the Dark Power was bending all its will to gather them there. The Ring \\nof the Enemy would leave its mark, too, leave him open to the summons. And \\nall folk were whispering then of the new Shadow in the South, and its hatred \\nof the West. There were his fine new friends, who would help him in his \\nrevenge ! \\n\\n\\'Wretched fool! In that land he would learn much, too much for his \\ncomfort. And sooner or later as he lurked and pried on the borders he would \\nbe caught, and taken - for examination. That was the way of it, I fear. When \\nhe was found he had already been there long, and was on his way back. On \\nsome errand of mischief. But that does not matter much now. His worst \\nmischief was done. \\n\\n\\'Yes, alas! through him the Enemy has learned that the One has been \\nfound again. He knows where Isildur fell. He knows where Gollum found his \\nring. He knows that it is a Great Ring, for it gave long life. He knows that \\nit is not one of the Three, for they have never been lost, and they endure \\nno evil. He knows that it is not one of the Seven, or the Nine, for they are \\naccounted for. He knows that it is the One. And he has at last heard, I \\nthink, of hobbits and the Shire. \\n\\n\\'The Shire - he may be seeking for it now, if he has not already found \\nout where it lies. Indeed, Frodo, I fear that he may even think that the \\nlong -unnoticed name of Baggins has become important.\\' \\n\\n\\'But this is terrible!\\' cried Frodo. \\'Far worse than the worst that I \\nimagined from your hints and warnings. O Gandalf, best of friends, what am I \\nto do? For now I am really afraid. What am I to do? What a pity that Bilbo \\ndid not stab that vile creature, when he had a chance!\\' \\n\\n\\'Pity? It was Pity that stayed his hand. Pity, and Mercy: not to strike \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwithout need. And he has been well rewarded, Frodo. Be sure that he took so \\nlittle hurt from the evil, and escaped in the end, because he began his \\nownership of the Ring so. With Pity.\\' \\n\\n\\'I am sorry,\\' said Frodo. \\'But I am frightened; and I do not feel any \\npity for Gollum.\\' \\n\\n\\'You have not seen him,\\' Gandalf broke in. \\n\\n\\'No, and I don\\'t want to,\\' said Frodo. I can\\'t understand you. Do you \\nmean to say that you, and the Elves, have let him live on after all those \\nhorrible deeds? Now at any rate he is as bad as an Ore, and just an enemy. \\nHe deserves death.\\' \\n\\n\\'Deserves it! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And some \\nthat die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to \\ndeal out death in judgement. For even the very wise cannot see all ends. I \\nhave not much hope that Gollum can be cured before he dies, but there is a \\nchance of it. And he is bound up with the fate of the Ring. My heart tells \\nme that he has some part to play yet, for good or ill, before the end; and \\nwhen that comes, the pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many - yours not \\nleast. In any case we did not kill him: he is very old and very wretched. \\n\\nThe Wood-elves have him in prison, but they treat him with such kindness as \\nthey can find in their wise hearts.\\' \\n\\n\\'All the same,\\' said Frodo, \\'even if Bilbo could not kill Gollum, I \\nwish he had not kept the Ring. I wish he had never found it, and that I had \\nnot got it! Why did you let me keep it? Why didn\\'t you make me throw it \\naway, or, or destroy it?\\' \\n\\n\\'Let you? Make you?\\' said the wizard. \\'Haven\\'t you been listening to \\nall that I have said? You are not thinking of what you are saying. But as \\nfor throwing it away, that was obviously wrong. These Rings have a way of \\nbeing found. In evil hands it might have done great evil. Worst of all, it \\nmight have fallen into the hands of the Enemy. Indeed it certainly would; \\nfor this is the One, and he is exerting all his power to find it or draw it \\nto himself. \\n\\n\\'Of course, my dear Frodo, it was dangerous for you; and that has \\ntroubled me deeply. But there was so much at stake that I had to take some \\nrisk - though even when I was far away there has never been a day when the \\nShire has not been guarded by watchful eyes. As long as you never used it, I \\ndid not think that the Ring would have any lasting effect on you, not for \\nevil, not at any rate for a very long time. And you must remember that nine \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyears ago, when I last saw you, I still knew little for certain.\\' \\n\\n\\'But why not destroy it, as you say should have been done long ago?\\' \\ncried Frodo again. If you had warned me, or even sent me a message, I would \\nhave done away with it.\\' \\n\\n\\'Would you? How would you do that? Have you ever tried?\\' \\n\\n\\'No. But I suppose one could hammer it or melt it.\\' \\n\\n\\'Try!\\' said Gandalf. Try now!\\' \\n\\nFrodo drew the Ring out of his pocket again and looked at it. It now \\nappeared plain and smooth, without mark or device that he could see. The \\ngold looked very fair and pure, and Frodo thought how rich and beautiful was \\nits colour, how perfect was its roundness. It was an admirable thing and \\naltogether precious. When he took it out he had intended to fling it from \\nhim into the very hottest part of the fire. But he found now that he could \\nnot do so, not without a great struggle. He weighed the Ring in his hand, \\nhesitating, and forcing himself to remember all that Gandalf had told him; \\nand then with an effort of will he made a movement, as if to cast it away - \\nbut he found that he had put it back in his pocket. \\n\\nGandalf laughed grimly. \\'You see? Already you too, Frodo, cannot easily \\nlet it go, nor will to damage it. And I could not \"make\" you - except by \\nforce, which would break your mind. But as for breaking the Ring, force is \\nuseless. Even if you took it and struck it with a heavy sledge-hammer, it \\nwould make no dint in it. It cannot be unmade by your hands, or by mine. \\n\\n\\'Your small fire, of course, would not melt even ordinary gold. This \\nRing has already passed through it unscathed, and even unheated. But there \\nis no smith\\'s forge in this Shire that could change it at all. Not even the \\nanvils and furnaces of the Dwarves could do that. It has been said that \\ndragon-fire could melt and consume the Rings of Power, but there is not now \\nany dragon left on earth in which the old fire is hot enough; nor was there \\never any dragon, not even Ancalagon the Black, who could have harmed the \\nOne \\n\\nRing, the Ruling Ring, for that was made by Sauron himself. There is only \\none way: to find the Cracks of Doom in the depths of Orodruin, the \\nFire-mountain, and cast the Ring in there, if you really wish to destroy it, \\nto put it beyond the grasp of the Enemy for ever.\\' \\n\\n\\'I do really wish to destroy it!\\' cried Frodo. \\'Or, well, to have it \\ndestroyed. I am not made for perilous quests. I wish I had never seen the \\nRing ! Why did it come to me? Why was I chosen?\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Such questions cannot be answered,\\' said Gandalf. \\'You may be sure \\nthat it was not for any merit that others do not possess: not for power or \\nwisdom, at any rate. But you have been chosen, and you must therefore use \\nsuch strength and heart and wits as you have.\\' \\n\\n\\'But I have so little of any of these things! You are wise and \\npowerful. Will you not take the Ring?\\' \\n\\n\\'No!\\' cried Gandalf, springing to his feet. \\'With that power I should \\nhave power too great and terrible. And over me the Ring would gain a power \\nstill greater and more deadly.\\' His eyes flashed and his face was lit as by \\na fire within. \\'Do not tempt me! For I do not wish to become like the Dark \\nLord himself. Yet the way of the Ring to my heart is by pity, pity for \\nweakness and the desire of strength to do good. Do not tempt me! I dare not \\ntake it, not even to keep it safe, unused. The wish to wield it would be too \\ngreat, for my strength. I shall have such need of it. Great perils lie \\nbefore me.\\' \\n\\nHe went to the window and drew aside the curtains and the shutters. \\nSunlight streamed back again into the room. Sam passed along the path \\noutside whistling. \\'And now,\\' said the wizard, turning back to Frodo, \\'the \\ndecision lies with you. But I will always help you.\\' He laid his hand on \\nFrodo\\'s shoulder. \\'I will help you bear this burden, as long as It is yours \\nto bear. But we must do something, soon. The Enemy is moving.\\' \\n\\nThere was a long silence. Gandalf sat down again and puffed at his \\npipe, as if lost in thought. His eyes seemed closed, but under the lids he \\nwas watching Frodo intently. Frodo gazed fixedly at the red embers on the \\nhearth, until they filled all his vision, and he seemed to be looking down \\ninto profound wells of fire. He was thinking of the fabled Cracks of Doom \\nand the terror of the Fiery Mountain. \\n\\n\\'Well!\\' said Gandalf at last. \\'What are you thinking about? Have you \\ndecided what to do?\\' \\n\\n\\'No!\\' answered Frodo, coming back to himself out of darkness, and \\nfinding to his surprise that it was not dark, and that out of the window he \\ncould see the sunlit garden. \\'Or perhaps, yes. As far as I understand what \\nyou have said, I suppose I must keep the Ring and guard it, at least for the \\npresent, whatever it may do to me.\\' \\n\\n\\'Whatever it may do, it will be slow, slow to evil, if you keep it with \\nthat purpose,\\' said Gandalf. \\n\\n\\'I hope so,\\' said Frodo. \\'But I hope that you may find some other \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbetter keeper soon. But in the meanwhile it seems that I am a danger, a \\ndanger to all that live near me. I cannot keep the Ring and stay here. I \\nought to leave Bag End, leave the Shire, leave everything and go away.\\' He \\nsighed. \\n\\n\\'I should like to save the Shire, if I could - though there have been \\ntimes when I thought the inhabitants too stupid and dull for words, and have \\nfelt that an earthquake or an invasion of dragons might be good for them. \\nBut I don\\'t feel like that now. I feel that as long as the Shire lies \\nbehind, safe and comfortable, I shall find wandering more bearable: I shall \\nknow that somewhere there is a firm foothold, even if my feet cannot stand \\nthere again. \\n\\n\\'Of course, I have sometimes thought of going away, but I imagined that \\nas a kind of holiday, a series of adventures like Bilbo\\'s or better, ending \\nin peace. But this would mean exile, a flight from danger into danger, \\ndrawing it after me. And I suppose I must go alone, if I am to do that and \\nsave the Shire. But I feel very small, and very uprooted, and well - \\ndesperate. The Enemy is so strong and terrible.\\' \\n\\nHe did not tell Gandalf, but as he was speaking a great desire to \\nfollow Bilbo flamed up in his heart - to follow Bilbo, and even perhaps to \\nfind him again. It was so strong that it overcame his fear: he could almost \\nhave run out there and then down the road without his hat, as Bilbo had done \\non a similar morning long ago. \\n\\n\\'My dear Frodo!\\' exclaimed Gandalf. \\'Hobbits really are amazing \\ncreatures, as I have said before. You can learn all that there is to know \\nabout their ways in a month, and yet after a hundred years they can still \\nsurprise you at a pinch. I hardly expected to get such an answer, not even \\nfrom you. But Bilbo made no mistake in choosing his heir, though he little \\nthought how important it would prove. I am afraid you are right. The Ring \\nwill not be able to stay hidden in the Shire much longer; and for your own \\nsake, as well as for others, you will have to go, and leave the name of \\nBaggins behind you. That name will not be safe to have, outside the Shire or \\nin the Wild. I will give you a travelling name now. When you go, go as Mr. \\nUnderhill. \\n\\n\\'But I don\\'t think you need go alone. Not if you know of anyone you can \\ntrust, and who would be willing to go by your side - and that you would be \\nwilling to take into unknown perils. But if you look for a companion, be \\ncareful in choosing! And be careful of what you say, even to your closest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfriends! The enemy has many spies and many ways of hearing.\\' \\n\\nSuddenly he stopped as if listening. Frodo became aware that all was \\nvery quiet, inside and outside. Gandalf crept to one side of the window. \\nThen with a dart he sprang to the sill, and thrust a long arm out and \\ndownwards. There was a squawk, and up came Sam Gamgee\\'s curly head \\nhauled by \\none ear. \\n\\n\\'Well, well, bless my beard!\\' said Gandalf. \\'Sam Gamgee is it? Now what \\nmay you be doing?\\' \\n\\n\\'Lor bless you, Mr. Gandalf, sir!\\' said Sam. \\'Nothing! Leastways I was \\njust trimming the grass-border under the window, if you follow me.\\' He \\npicked up his shears and exhibited them as evidence. \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t,\\' said Gandalf grimly. It is some time since I last heard the \\nsound of your shears. How long have you been eavesdropping?\\' \\n\\n\\'Eavesdropping, sir? I don\\'t follow you, begging your pardon. There \\nain\\'t no eaves at Bag End, and that\\'s a fact.\\' \\n\\n\\'Don\\'t be a fool! What have you heard, and why did you listen?\\' \\nGandalf s eyes flashed and his brows stuck out like bristles. \\n\\n\\'Mr. Frodo, sir!\\' cried Sam quaking. \\'Don\\'t let him hurt me, sir! Don\\'t \\nlet him turn me into anything unnatural! My old dad would take on so. I \\nmeant no harm, on my honour, sir!\\' \\n\\n\\'He won\\'t hurt you,\\' said Frodo, hardly able to keep from laughing, \\nalthough he was himself startled and rather puzzled. \\'He knows, as well as I \\ndo, that you mean no harm. But just you up and answer his questions straight \\naway!\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, sir,\\' said Sam dithering a little. \\'I heard a deal that I didn\\'t \\nrightly understand, about an enemy, and rings, and Mr. Bilbo, sir, and \\ndragons, and a fiery mountain, and - and Elves, sir. I listened because I \\ncouldn\\'t help myself, if you know what I mean. Lor bless me, sir, but I do \\nlove tales of that sort. And I believe them too, whatever Ted may say. \\nElves, sir! I would dearly love to see them. Couldn\\'t you take me to see \\nElves, sir, when you go?\\' \\n\\nSuddenly Gandalf laughed. \\'Come inside!\\' he shouted, and putting out \\nboth his arms he lifted the astonished Sam, shears, grass-clippings and all, \\nright through the window and stood him on the floor. \\'Take you to see Elves, \\neh?\\' he said, eyeing Sam closely, but with a smile flickering on his face. \\n\\n\\'So you heard that Mr. Frodo is going away?\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'I did, sir. And that\\'s why I choked: which you heard seemingly. I \\ntried not to, sir, but it burst out of me: I was so upset.\\' \\n\\n\\'It can\\'t be helped, Sam,\\' said Frodo sadly. He had suddenly realized \\nthat flying from the Shire would mean more painful partings than merely \\nsaying farewell to the familiar comforts of Bag End. \\'I shall have to go. \\nBut\\' - and here he looked hard at Sam - \\'if you really care about me, you \\nwill keep that dead secret. See? If you don\\'t, if you even breathe a word of \\nwhat you\\'ve heard here, then I hope Gandalf will turn you into a spotted \\ntoad and fill the garden full of grass-snakes.\\' \\n\\nSam fell on his knees, trembling. \\'Get up, Sam!\\' said Gandalf. I have \\nthought of something better than that. Something to shut your mouth, and \\npunish you properly for listening. You shall go away with Mr. Frodo!\\' \\n\\n\\'Me, sir!\\' cried Sam, springing up like a dog invited for a walk. \\'Me \\ngo and see Elves and all! Hooray!\\' he shouted, and then burst into tears. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 3 . Three is Company \\n\\n\\n\\n\\'You ought to go quietly, and you ought to go soon,\\' said Gandalf. Two \\nor three weeks had passed, and still Frodo made no sign of getting ready to \\n\\ngo- \\n\\n\\'I know. But it is difficult to do both,\\' he objected. If I just vanish \\nlike Bilbo, the tale will be all over the Shire in no time.\\' \\n\\n\\'Of course you mustn\\'t vanish!\\' said Gandalf. \\'That wouldn\\'t do at all! \\n\\nI said soon, not instantly. If you can think of any way of slipping out of \\nthe Shire without its being generally known, it will be worth a little \\ndelay. But you must not delay too long.\\' \\n\\n\\'What about the autumn, on or after Our Birthday?\\' asked Frodo. \\'I \\nthink I could probably make some arrangements by then.\\' \\n\\nTo tell the truth, he was very reluctant to start, now that it had come \\nto the point. Bag End seemed a more desirable residence than it had for \\nyears, and he wanted to savour as much as he could of his last summer in the \\nShire. When autumn came, he knew that part at least of his heart would think \\nmore kindly of journeying, as it always did at that season. He had indeed \\nprivately made up his mind to leave on his fiftieth birthday: Bilbo\\'s one \\nhundred and twenty-eighth. It seemed somehow the proper day on which to set \\nout and follow him. Following Bilbo was uppermost in his mind, and the one \\nthing that made the thought of leaving bearable. He thought as little as \\npossible about the Ring, and where it might lead him in the end. But he did \\nnot tell all his thoughts to Gandalf. What the wizard guessed was always \\ndifficult to tell. \\n\\nHe looked at Frodo and smiled. \\'Very well,\\' he said. \\'I think that will \\ndo - but it must not be any later. I am getting very anxious. In the \\nmean-while, do take care, and don\\'t let out any hint of where you are going! \\nAnd see that Sam Gamgee does not talk. If he does, I really shall turn him \\ninto a toad.\\' \\n\\n\\'As for where I am going,\\' said Frodo, \\'it would be difficult to give \\nthat away, for I have no clear idea myself, yet.\\' \\n\\n\\'Don\\'t be absurd!\\' said Gandalf. \\'I am not warning you against leaving \\nan address at the post-office! But you are leaving the Shire - and that \\nshould not be known, until you are far away. And you must go, or at least \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nset out, either North, South, West or East - and the direction should \\ncertainly not be known.\\' \\n\\n\\'I have been so taken up with the thoughts of leaving Bag End, and of \\nsaying farewell, that I have never even considered the direction,\\' said \\nFrodo. \\'For where am I to go? And by what shall I steer? What is to be my \\nquest? Bilbo went to find a treasure, there and back again; but I go to lose \\none, and not return, as far as I can see.\\' \\n\\n\\'But you cannot see very far,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Neither can I. It may be \\nyour task to find the Cracks of Doom; but that quest may be for others: I do \\nnot know. At any rate you are not ready for that long road yet.\\' \\n\\n\\'No indeed!\\' said Frodo. \\'But in the meantime what course am I to \\nlake?\\' \\n\\n\\'Towards danger; but not too rashly, nor too straight,\\' answered the \\nwizard. \\'If you want my advice, make for Rivendell. That journey should not \\nprove too perilous, though the Road is less easy than it was, and it will \\ngrow worse as the year fails.\\' \\n\\n\\'Rivendell!\\' said Frodo. \\'Very good: I will go east, and I will make \\nfor Rivendell. I will take Sam to visit the Elves; he will be delighted.\\' He \\nspoke lightly; but his heart was moved suddenly with a desire to see the \\nhouse of Elrond Halfelven, and breathe the air of that deep valley where \\nmany of the Fair Folk still dwelt in peace. \\n\\nOne summer\\'s evening an astonishing piece of news reached the Ivy Bush \\nand Green Dragon. Giants and other portents on the borders of the Shire were \\nforgotten for more important matters: Mr. Frodo was selling Bag End, indeed \\nhe had already sold it - to the Sackville-Bagginses! \\n\\n\\'For a nice bit, loo,\\' said some. \\'At a bargain price,\\' said others, \\n\\n\\'and that\\'s more likely when Mistress Fobelia\\'s the buyer.\\' (Otho had died \\nsome years before, at the ripe but disappointed age of 102.) \\n\\nJust why Mr. Frodo was selling his beautiful hole was even more \\ndebatable than the price. A few held the theory - supported by the nods and \\nhints of Mr. Baggins himself - that Frodo\\'s money was running out: he was \\ngoing to leave Hobbiton and live in a quiet way on the proceeds of the sale \\ndown in Buckland among his Brandybuck relations. \\'As far from the \\nSackville-Bagginses as may be,\\' some added. But so firmly fixed had the \\nnotion of the immeasurable wealth of the Bagginses of Bag End become that \\nmost found this hard to believe, harder than any other reason or unreason \\nthat their fancy could suggest: to most it suggested a dark and yet \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nunrevealed plot by Gandalf. Though he kept himself very quiet and did not go \\nabout by day, it was well known that he was \\'hiding up in the Bag End\\'. But \\nhowever a removal might fit in with the designs of his wizardry, there was \\nno doubt about the fact: Frodo Baggins was going back to Buckland. \\n\\n\\'Yes, I shall be moving this autumn,\\' he said. \\'Merry Brandybuck is \\nlooking out for a nice little hole for me, or perhaps a small house.\\' \\n\\nAs a matter of fact with Merry\\'s help he had already chosen and bought \\na little house at Crickhollow in the country beyond Bucklebury. To all but \\nSam he pretended he was going to settle down there permanently. The decision \\nto set out eastwards had suggested the idea to him; for Buckland was on the \\neastern borders of the Shire, and as he had lived there in childhood his \\ngoing back would at least seem credible. \\n\\nGandalf stayed in the Shire for over two months. Then one evening, at \\nthe end of June, soon after Frodo\\'s plan had been finally arranged, he \\nsuddenly announced that he was going off again next morning. \\'Only for a \\nshort while, I hope,\\' he said. \\'But I am going down beyond the southern \\nborders to get some news, if I can. I have been idle longer than I should.\\' \\n\\nHe spoke lightly, but it seemed to Frodo that he looked rather worried. \\n\\n\\'Has anything happened?\\' he asked. \\n\\n\\'Well no; but I have heard something that has made me anxious and needs \\nlooking into. If I think it necessary after all for you to get off at once, \\n\\nI shall come back immediately, or at least send word. In the meanwhile stick \\nto your plan; but be more careful than ever, especially of the Ring. Fet me \\nimpress on you once more: don\\'t use it!\\' \\n\\nHe went off at dawn. \\'I may be back any day,\\' he said. \\'At the very \\nlatest I shall come back for the farewell party. I think after all you may \\nneed my company on the Road.\\' \\n\\nAt first Frodo was a good deal disturbed, and wondered often what \\nGandalf could have heard; but his uneasiness wore off, and in the fine \\nweather he forgot his troubles for a while. The Shire had seldom seen so \\nfair a summer, or so rich an autumn: the trees were laden with apples, honey \\nwas dripping in the combs, and the corn was tall and full. \\n\\nAutumn was well under way before Frodo began to worry about Gandalf \\nagain. September was passing and there was still no news of him. The \\nBirthday, and the removal, drew nearer, and still he did not come, or send \\nword. Bag End began to be busy. Some of Frodo\\'s friends came to stay and \\nhelp him with the packing: there was Fredegar Bolger and Folco Boffin, and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nof course his special friends Pippin Took and Merry Brandybuck. Between \\nthem \\n\\nthey turned the whole place upside-down. \\n\\nOn September 20th two covered carts went off laden to Buckland, \\nconveying the furniture and goods that Frodo had not sold to his new home, \\nby way of the Brandywine Bridge. The next day Frodo became really anxious, \\nand kept a constant look-out for Gandalf. Thursday, his birthday morning, \\ndawned as fair and clear as it had long ago for Bilbo\\'s great party. Still \\nGandalf did not appear. In the evening Frodo gave his farewell feast: it was \\nquite small, just a dinner for himself and his four helpers; but he was \\ntroubled and fell in no mood for it. The thought that he would so soon have \\nto part with his young friends weighed on his heart. He wondered how he \\nwould break it to them. \\n\\nThe four younger hobbits were, however, in high spirits, and the party \\nsoon became very cheerful in spite of Gandalf s absence. The dining-room was \\nbare except for a table and chairs, but the food was good, and there was \\ngood wine: Frodo\\'s wine had not been included in the sale to the \\nSackville-Bagginses. \\n\\n\\'Whatever happens to the rest of my stuff, when the S.-B.s get their \\nclaws on it, at any rate I have found a good home for this!\\' said Frodo, as \\nhe drained his glass. It was the last drop of Old Winyards. \\n\\nWhen they had sung many songs, and talked of many things they had done \\ntogether, they toasted Bilbo\\'s birthday, and they drank his health and \\nFrodo\\'s together according to Frodo\\'s custom. Then they went out for a sniff \\nof air, and glimpse of the stars, and then they went to bed. Frodo\\'s party \\nwas over, and Gandalf had not come. \\n\\nThe next morning they were busy packing another cart with the remainder \\nof the luggage. Merry took charge of this, and drove off with Fatty (that is \\nFredegar Bolger). \\'Someone must get there and warm the house before you \\narrive,\\' said Merry. \\'Well, see you later - the day after tomorrow, if you \\ndon\\'t go to sleep on the way!\\' \\n\\nFolco went home after lunch, but Pippin remained behind. Frodo was \\nrestless and anxious, listening in vain for a sound of Gandalf. He decided \\nto wait until nightfall. After that, if Gandalf wanted him urgently, he \\nwould go to Crickhollow, and might even get there first. For Frodo was going \\non foot. His plan - for pleasure and a last look at the Shire as much as any \\nother reason - was to walk from Hobbiton to Bucklebury Ferry, taking it \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfairly easy. \\n\\n\\'I shall get myself a bit into training, too,\\' he said, looking at \\nhimself in a dusty mirror in the half-empty hall. He had not done any \\nstrenuous walking for a long time, and the reflection looked rather flabby, \\nhe thought. \\n\\nAfter lunch, the Sackville-Bagginses, Lobelia and her sandy-haired son, \\nLotho, turned up, much to Frodo\\'s annoyance. \\'Ours at last!\\' said Lobelia, \\nas she stepped inside. It was not polite; nor strictly true, for the sale of \\nBag End did not take effect until midnight. But Lobelia can perhaps be \\nforgiven: she had been obliged to wait about seventy-seven years longer for \\nBag End than she once hoped, and she was now a hundred years old. \\nAnyway, \\n\\nshe had come to see that nothing she had paid for had been carried off; and \\nshe wanted the keys. It took a long while to satisfy her, as she had brought \\na complete inventory with her and went right through it. In the end she \\ndeparted with Lotho and the spare key and the promise that the other key \\nwould be left at the Gamgees\\' in Bagshot Row. She snorted, and showed \\nplainly that she thought the Gamgees capable of plundering the hole during \\nthe night. Frodo did not offer her any tea. \\n\\nHe took his own tea with Pippin and Sam Gamgee in the kitchen. It had \\nbeen officially announced that Sam was coming to Buckland \\'to do for Mr. \\nFrodo and look after his bit of garden\\'; an arrangement that was approved by \\nthe Gaffer, though it did not console him for the prospect of having Lobelia \\nas a neighbour. \\n\\n\\'Our last meal at Bag End!\\' said Frodo, pushing back his chair. They \\nleft the washing up for Lobelia. Pippin and Sam strapped up their three \\npacks and piled them in the porch. Pippin went out for a last stroll in the \\ngarden. Sam disappeared. \\n\\nThe sun went down. Bag End seemed sad and gloomy and dishevelled. \\nFrodo \\n\\nwandered round the familiar rooms, and saw the light of the sunset fade on \\nthe walls, and shadows creep out of the corners. It grew slowly dark \\nindoors. He went out and walked down to the gate at the bottom of the path, \\nand then on a short way down the Hill Road. He half expected to see Gandalf \\ncome striding up through the dusk. \\n\\nThe sky was clear and the stars were growing bright. \\'It\\'s going to be \\na fine night,\\' he said aloud. \\'That\\'s good for a beginning. I feel like \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwalking. I can\\'t bear any more hanging about. I am going to start, and \\nGandalf must follow me.\\' He turned to go back, and then slopped, for he \\nheard voices, just round the corner by the end of Bagshot Row. One voice was \\ncertainly the old Gaffer\\'s; the other was strange, and somehow unpleasant. \\n\\nHe could not make out what it said, but he heard the Gaffer\\'s answers, which \\nwere rather shrill. The old man seemed put out. \\n\\n\\'No, Mr. Baggins has gone away. Went this morning, and my Sam went \\nwith \\n\\nhim: anyway all his stuff went. Yes, sold out and gone, I tell\\'ee. Why? \\nWhy\\'s none of my business, or yours. Where to? That ain\\'t no secret. He\\'s \\nmoved to Bucklebury or some such place, away down yonder. Yes it is - a tidy \\nway. I\\'ve never been so far myself; they\\'re queer folks in Buckland. No, I \\ncan\\'t give no message. Good night to you!\\' \\n\\nFootsteps went away down the Hill. Frodo wondered vaguely why the fact \\nthat they did not come on up the Hill seemed a great relief. \\'I am sick of \\nquestions and curiosity about my doings, I suppose,\\' he thought. \\'What an \\ninquisitive lot they all are!\\' He had half a mind to go and ask the Gaffer \\nwho the inquirer was; but he thought better (or worse) of it, and turned and \\nwalked quickly back to Bag End. \\n\\nPippin was sitting on his pack in the porch. Sam was not there. Frodo \\nstepped inside the dark door. \\'Sam!\\' he called. \\'Sam! Time!\\' \\n\\n\\'Coming, sir!\\' came the answer from far within, followed soon by Sam \\nhimself, wiping his mouth. He had been saying farewell to the beer -barrel in \\nthe cellar. \\n\\n\\'All aboard, Sam?\\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'Yes, sir. I\\'ll last for a bit now, sir.\\' \\n\\nFrodo shut and locked the round door, and gave the key to Sam. \\'Run \\ndown with this to your home, Sam!\\' he said. \\'Then cut along the Row and meet \\nus as quick as you can at the gate in the lane beyond the meadows. We are \\nnot going through the village tonight. Too many ears pricking and eyes \\nprying.\\' Sam ran off at full speed. \\n\\n\\'Well, now we\\'re off at last!\\' said Frodo. They shouldered their packs \\nand took up their sticks, and walked round the corner to the west side of \\nBag End. \\'Good-bye!\\' said Frodo, looking at the dark blank windows. He \\nwaved \\n\\nhis hand, and then turned and (following Bilbo, if he had known it) hurried \\nafter Peregrin down the garden-path. They jumped over the low place in the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhedge at the bottom and took to the fields, passing into the darkness like a \\nrustle in the grasses. \\n\\nAt the bottom of the Hill on its western side they came to the gate \\nopening on to a narrow lane. There they halted and adjusted the straps of \\ntheir packs. Presently Sam appeared, trotting quickly and breathing hard; \\nhis heavy pack was hoisted high on his shoulders, and he had put on his head \\na tall shapeless fell bag, which he called a hat. In the gloom he looked \\nvery much like a dwarf. \\n\\n\\'I am sure you have given me all the heaviest stuff,\\' said Frodo. \\'I \\npity snails, and all that carry their homes on their backs.\\' \\n\\n\\'I could take a lot more yet, sir. My packet is quite light,\\' said Sam \\nstoutly and untruthfully. \\n\\n\\'No, you don\\'t, Sam!\\' said Pippin. \\'It is good for him. He\\'s got \\nnothing except what he ordered us to pack. He\\'s been slack lately, and he\\'ll \\nfeel the weight less when he\\'s walked off some of his own.\\' \\n\\n\\'Be kind to a poor old hobbit!\\' laughed Frodo. \\'I shall be as thin as a \\nwillow-wand, I\\'m sure, before I get to Buckland. But I was talking nonsense. \\n\\nI suspect you have taken more than your share, Sam, and I shall look into it \\nat our next packing.\\' He picked up his stick again. \\'Well, we all like \\nwalking in the dark,\\' he said, \\'so let\\'s put some miles behind us before \\nbed.\\' \\n\\nFor a short way they followed the lane westwards. Then leaving it they \\nturned left and took quietly to the fields again. They went in single file \\nalong hedgerows and the borders of coppices, and night fell dark about them. \\nIn their dark cloaks they were as invisible as if they all had magic rings. \\n\\nSince they were all hobbits, and were trying to be silent, they made no \\nnoise that even hobbits would hear. Even the wild things in the fields and \\nwoods hardly noticed their passing. \\n\\nAfter some time they crossed the Water, west of Hobbiton, by a narrow \\nplank -bridge. The stream was there no more than a winding black ribbon, \\nbordered with leaning alder -trees. A mile or two further south they hastily \\ncrossed the great road from the Brandywine Bridge; they were now in the \\nTookland and bending south-eastwards they made for the Green Hill Country. \\nAs they began to climb its first slopes they looked back and saw the lamps \\nin Hobbiton far off twinkling in the gentle valley of the Water. Soon it \\ndisappeared in the folds of the darkened land, and was followed by By water \\nbeside its grey pool. When the light of the last farm was far behind, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\npeeping among the trees, Frodo turned and waved a hand in farewell. \\n\\n\\'I wonder if I shall ever look down into that valley again,\\' he said \\nquietly. \\n\\nWhen they had walked for about three hours they rested. The night was \\nclear, cool, and starry, but smoke-like wisps of mist were creeping up the \\nhill-sides from the streams and deep meadows. Thin-clad birches, swaying in \\na light wind above their heads, made a black net against the pale sky. They \\nate a very frugal supper (for hobbits), and then went on again. Soon they \\nstruck a narrow road, that went rolling up and down, fading grey into the \\ndarkness ahead: the road to Woodhall, and Stock, and the Bucklebury Ferry. \\nIt climbed away from the main road in the Water -valley, and wound over the \\nskirts of the Green Hills towards Woody-End, a wild corner of the \\nEastfarthing. \\n\\nAfter a while they plunged into a deeply cloven track between tall \\ntrees that rustled their dry leaves in the night. It was very dark. At first \\nthey talked, or hummed a tune softly together, being now far away from \\ninquisitive ears. Then they marched on in silence, and Pippin began to lag \\nbehind. At last, as they began to climb a steep slope, he stopped and \\nyawned. \\n\\n\\'I am so sleepy,\\' he said, \\'that soon I shall fall down on the road. \\n\\nAre you going to sleep on your legs? It is nearly midnight.\\' \\n\\n\\'I thought you liked walking in the dark,\\' said Frodo. \\'But there is no \\ngreat hurry. Merry expects us some time the day after tomorrow; but that \\nleaves us nearly two days more. We\\'ll halt at the first likely spot.\\' \\n\\n\\'The wind\\'s in the West,\\' said Sam. \\'If we get to the other side of \\nthis hill, we shall find a spot that is sheltered and snug enough, sir. \\n\\nThere is a dry fir-wood just ahead, if I remember rightly.\\' Sam knew the \\nland well within twenty miles of Hobbiton, but that was the limit of his \\ngeography. \\n\\nJust over the top of the hill they came on the patch of fir-wood. \\n\\nLeaving the road they went into the deep resin-scented darkness of the \\ntrees, and gathered dead sticks and cones to make a fire. Soon they had a \\nmerry crackle of flame at the foot of a large fir-tree and they sat round it \\nfor a while, until they began to nod. Then, each in an angle of the great \\ntree\\'s roots, they curled up in their cloaks and blankets, and were soon \\nfast asleep. They set no watch; even Frodo feared no danger yet, for they \\nwere still in the heart of the Shire. A few creatures came and looked at \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthem when the fire had died away. A fox passing through the wood on business \\nof his own stopped several minutes and sniffed. \\n\\n\\'Hobbits!\\' he thought. \\'Well, what next? I have heard of strange doings \\nin this land, but I have seldom heard of a hobbit sleeping out of doors \\nunder a tree. Three of them! There\\'s something mighty queer behind this.\\' He \\nwas quite right, but he never found out any more about it. \\n\\nThe morning came, pale and clammy. Frodo woke up first, and found that \\na tree-root had made a hole in his back, and that his neck was stiff. \\n\\n\\'Walking for pleasure! Why didn\\'t I drive?\\' he thought, as he usually \\ndid at the beginning of an expedition. \\'And all my beautiful feather beds \\nare sold to the Sackville-Bagginses! These tree-roots would do them good.\\' \\n\\nHe stretched. \\'Wake up, hobbits!\\' he cried. It\\'s a beautiful morning.\\' \\n\\n\\'What\\'s beautiful about it?\\' said Pippin, peering over the edge of his \\nblanket with one eye. \\'Sam! Gel breakfast ready for half-past nine! Have you \\ngot the bath-water hot?\\' \\n\\nSam jumped up, looking rather bleary. \\'No, sir, I haven\\'t, sir!\\' he \\nsaid. \\n\\nFrodo stripped the blankets from Pippin and rolled him over, and then \\nwalked off to the edge of the wood. Away eastward the sun was rising red out \\nof the mists that lay thick on the world. Touched with gold and red the \\nautumn trees seemed to be sailing rootless in a shadowy sea. A little below \\nhim to the left the road ran down steeply into a hollow and disappeared. \\n\\nWhen he returned Sam and Pippin had got a good fire going. \\'Water!\\' \\nshouted Pippin. \\'Where\\'s the water?\\' \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t keep water in my pockets,\\' said Frodo. \\'We thought you had \\ngone to find some,\\' said Pippin, busy setting out the food, and cups. \\'You \\nhad better go now.\\' \\n\\n\\'You can come too,\\' said Frodo, \\'and bring all the water-bottles.\\' \\n\\nThere was a stream at the foot of the hill. They filled their bottles and \\nthe small camping kettle at a little fall where the water fell a few feet \\nover an outcrop of grey stone. It was icy cold; and they spluttered and \\npuffed as they bathed their faces and hands. \\n\\nWhen their breakfast was over, and their packs all trussed up again, it \\nwas after ten o\\'clock, and the day was beginning to turn fine and hot. They \\nwent down the slope, and across the stream where it dived under the road, \\nand up the next slope, and up and down another shoulder of the hills; and by \\nthat time their cloaks, blankets, water, food, and other gear already seemed \\n\\n\\n\\n\\na heavy burden. \\n\\nThe day\\'s march promised to be warm and tiring work. After some miles, \\nhowever, the road ceased to roll up and down: it climbed to the top of a \\nsteep bank in a weary zig-zagging sort of way, and then prepared to go down \\nfor the last time. In front of them they saw the lower lands dotted with \\nsmall clumps of trees that melted away in the distance to a brown woodland \\nhaze. They were looking across the Woody End towards the Brandywine \\nRiver. \\n\\nThe road wound away before them like a piece of string. \\n\\n\\'The road goes on for ever,\\' said Pippin; \\'but I can\\'t without a rest. \\n\\nIt is high time for lunch.\\' He sat down on the bank at the side of the road \\nand looked away east into the haze, beyond which lay the River, and the end \\nof the Shire in which he had spent all his life. Sam stood by him. His round \\neyes were wide open - for he was looking across lands he had never seen to a \\nnew horizon. \\n\\n\\'Do Elves live in those woods?\\' he asked. \\n\\n\\'Not that I ever heard,\\' said Pippin. Frodo was silent. He too was \\ngazing eastward along the road, as if he had never seen it before. Suddenly \\nhe spoke, aloud but as if to himself, saying slowly: \\n\\nThe Road goes ever on and on \\nDown from the door where it began. \\n\\nNow far ahead the Road has gone, \\n\\nAnd I must follow, if I can, \\n\\nPursuing it with weary feet, \\n\\nUntil it joins some larger way, \\n\\nWhere many paths and errands meet. \\n\\nAnd whither then? I cannot say. \\n\\n\\'That sounds like a bit of old Bilbo\\'s rhyming,\\' said Pippin. \\'Or is it \\none of your imitations? It does not sound altogether encouraging.\\' \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know,\\' said Frodo. It came to me then, as if I was making it \\nup; but I may have heard it long ago. Certainly it reminds me very much of \\nBilbo in the last years, before he went away. He used often to say there was \\nonly one Road; that it was like a great river: its springs were at every \\ndoorstep, and every path was its tributary. \"It\\'s a dangerous business, \\nFrodo, going out of your door,\" he used to say. \"You step into the Road, and \\nif you don\\'t keep your feet, there is no knowing where you might be swept \\noff to. Do you realize that this is the very path that goes through \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMirkwood, and that if you let it, it might take you to the Lonely Mountain \\nor even further and to worse places?\" He used to say that on the path \\noutside the front door at Bag End, especially after he had been out for a \\nlong walk.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, the Road won\\'t sweep me anywhere for an hour at least,\\' said \\nPippin, unslinging his pack. The others followed his example, putting their \\npacks against the bank and their legs out into the road. After a rest they \\nhad a good lunch, and then more rest. \\n\\nThe sun was beginning to get low and the light of afternoon was on the \\nland as they went down the hill. So far they had not met a soul on the road. \\nThis way was not much used, being hardly fit for carts, and there was little \\ntraffic to the Woody End. They had been jogging along again for an hour or \\nmore when Sam stopped a moment as if listening. They were now on level \\nground, and the road after much winding lay straight ahead through \\ngrass-land sprinkled with tall trees, outliers of the approaching woods. \\n\\n\\'I can hear a pony or a horse coming along the road behind,\\' said Sam. \\n\\nThey looked back, but the turn of the road prevented them from seeing \\nfar. \\'I wonder if that is Gandalf coming after us,\\' said Frodo; but even as \\nhe said it, he had a feeling that it was not so, and a sudden desire to hide \\nfrom the view of the rider came over him. \\n\\n\\'It may not matter much,\\' he said apologetically, \\'but I would rather \\nnot be seen on the road - by anyone. I am sick of my doings being noticed \\nand discussed. And if it is Gandalf,\\' he added as an afterthought, \\'we can \\ngive him a little surprise, to pay him out for being so late. Let\\'s get out \\nof sight!\\' \\n\\nThe other two ran quickly to the left and down into a little hollow not \\nfar from the road. There they lay flat. Frodo hesitated for a second: \\ncuriosity or some other feeling was struggling with his desire to hide. The \\nsound of hoofs drew nearer. Just in time he threw himself down in a patch of \\nlong grass behind a tree that overshadowed the road. Then he lifted his head \\nand peered cautiously above one of the great roots. \\n\\nRound the corner came a black horse, no hobbit-pony but a full-sized \\nhorse; and on it sat a large man, who seemed to crouch in the saddle, \\nwrapped in a great black cloak and hood, so that only his boots in the high \\nstirrups showed below; his face was shadowed and invisible. \\n\\nWhen it reached the tree and was level with Frodo the horse stopped. \\n\\nThe riding figure sat quite still with its head bowed, as if listening. From \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ninside the hood came a noise as of someone sniffing to catch an elusive \\nscent; the head turned from side to side of the road. \\n\\nA sudden unreasoning fear of discovery laid hold of Frodo, and he \\nthought of his Ring. He hardly dared to breathe, and yet the desire to get \\nit out of his pocket became so strong that he began slowly to move his hand. \\n\\nHe felt that he had only to slip it on, and then he would be safe. The \\nadvice of Gandalf seemed absurd. Bilbo had used the Ring. \\'And I am still in \\nthe Shire,\\' he thought, as his hand touched the chain on which it hung. At \\nthat moment the rider sat up, and shook the reins. The horse stepped \\nforward, walking slowly at first, and then breaking into a quick trot. \\n\\nFrodo crawled to the edge of the road and watched the rider, until he \\ndwindled into the distance. He could not be quite sure, but it seemed to him \\nthat suddenly, before it passed out of sight, the horse turned aside and \\nwent into the trees on the right. \\n\\n\\'Well, I call that very queer, and indeed disturbing,\\' said Frodo to \\nhimself, as he walked towards his companions. Pippin and Sam had remained \\nflat in the grass, and had seen nothing; so Frodo described the rider and \\nhis strange behaviour. \\n\\n\\'I can\\'t say why, but I felt certain he was looking or smelling for me; \\nand also I felt certain that I did not want him to discover me. I\\'ve never \\nseen or fell anything like it in the Shire before.\\' \\n\\n\\'But what has one of the Big People got to do with us?\\' said Pippin. \\n\\n\\'And what is he doing in this part of the world?\\' \\n\\n\\'There are some Men about,\\' said Frodo. \\'Down in the Southfarthing they \\nhave had trouble with Big People, I believe. But I have never heard of \\nanything like this rider. I wonder where he comes from.\\' \\n\\n\\'Begging your pardon,\\' put in Sam suddenly, \\'I know where he comes \\nfrom. It\\'s from Hobbiton that this here black rider comes, unless there\\'s \\nmore than one. And I know where he\\'s going to.\\' \\n\\n\\'What do you mean?\\' said Frodo sharply, looking at him in astonishment. \\n\\'Why didn\\'t you speak up before?\\' \\n\\n\\'I have only just remembered, sir. It was like this: when I got back to \\nour hole yesterday evening with the key, my dad, he says to me: Hello, Sam! \\nhe says. I thought you were away with Mr. Frodo this morning. There\\'s been a \\nstrange customer asking for Mr. Baggins of Bag End, and he\\'s only just gone. \\nI\\'ve sent him on to Bucklebury. Not that Hiked the sound of him. He seemed \\nmighty put out, when I told him Mr. Baggins had left his old home for good. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHissed at me, he did. It gave me quite a shudder. What sort of a fellow was \\nhe? says I to the Gaffer. / don \\'t know, says he; but he wasn \\'t a hobbit. He \\nwas tall and black-like, and he stooped aver me. I reckon it was one of the \\nBig Folk from foreign parts. He spoke funny. \\n\\n\\'I couldn\\'t stay to hear more, sir, since you were waiting; and I \\ndidn\\'t give much heed to it myself. The Gaffer is getting old, and more than \\na bit blind, and it must have been near dark when this fellow come up the \\nHill and found him taking the air at the end of our Row. I hope he hasn\\'t \\ndone no harm, sir, nor me.\\' \\n\\n\\'The Gaffer can\\'t be blamed anyway,\\' said Frodo. \\'As a matter of fact I \\nheard him talking to a stranger, who seemed to be inquiring for me, and I \\nnearly went and asked him who it was. I wish I had, or you had told me about \\nit before. I might have been more careful on the road.\\' \\n\\n\\'Still, there may be no connexion between this rider and the Gaffer\\'s \\nstranger,\\' said Pippin. \\'We left Hobbiton secretly enough, and I don\\'t see \\nhow he could have followed us.\\' \\n\\n\\'What about the smelling, sir?\\' said Sam. \\'And the Gaffer said he was a \\nblack chap.\\' \\n\\n\\'I wish I had waited for Gandalf,\\' Frodo muttered. \\'But perhaps it \\nwould only have made matters worse.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then you know or guess something about this rider?\\' said Pippin, who \\nhad caught the muttered words. \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know, and I would rather not guess,\\' said Frodo. \\'All right, \\ncousin Frodo! You can keep your secret for the present, if you want to be \\nmysterious. In the meanwhile what are we to do? I should like a bite and a \\nsup, but somehow I think we had better move on from here. Your talk of \\nsniffing riders with invisible noses has unsettled me.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, I think we will move on now,\\' said Frodo; \\'but not on the road \\n-in case that rider comes back, or another follows him. We ought to do a \\ngood step more today. Buckland is still miles away.\\' \\n\\nThe shadows of the trees were long and thin on the grass, as they \\nstarted off again. They now kept a stone\\'s throw to the left of the road, \\nand kept out of sight of it as much as they could. But this hindered them; \\nfor the grass was thick and tussocky, and the ground uneven, and the trees \\nbegan to draw together into thickets. \\n\\nThe sun had gone down red behind the hills at their backs, and evening \\nwas coming on before they came back to the road at the end of the long level \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nover which it had run straight for some miles. At that point it bent left \\nand went down into the lowlands of the Yale making for Stock; but a lane \\nbranched right, winding through a wood of ancient oak-trees on its way to \\nWoodhall. \\'That is the way for us,\\' said Frodo. \\n\\nNot far from the road-meeting they came on the huge hulk of a tree: it \\nwas still alive and had leaves on the small branches that it had put out \\nround the broken stumps of its long-fallen limbs; but it was hollow, and \\ncould be entered by a great crack on the side away from the road. The \\nhobbits crept inside, and sat there upon a floor of old leaves and decayed \\nwood. They rested and had a light meal, talking quietly and listening from \\ntime to time. \\n\\nTwilight was about them as they crept back to the lane. The West wind \\nwas sighing in the branches. Leaves were whispering. Soon the road began to \\nfall gently but steadily into the dusk. A star came out above the trees in \\nthe darkening East before them. They went abreast and in step, to keep up \\ntheir spirits. After a time, as the stars grew thicker and brighter, the \\nfeeling of disquiet left them, and they no longer listened for the sound of \\nhoofs. They began to hum softly, as hobbits have a way of doing as they walk \\nalong, especially when they are drawing near to home at night. With most \\nhobbits it is a supper-song or a bed-song; but these hobbits hummed a \\nwalking-song (though not, of course, without any mention of supper and bed). \\nBilbo Baggins had made the words, to a tune that was as old as the hills, \\nand taught it to Frodo as they walked in the lanes of the Water -valley and \\ntalked about Adventure. \\n\\nUpon the hearth the fire is red, \\n\\nBeneath the roof there is a bed; \\n\\nBut not yet weary are our feet, \\n\\nStill round the corner we may meet \\nA sudden tree or standing stone \\nThat none have seen but we alone. \\n\\nTree and flower and leaf and grass, \\n\\nLet them pass! Let them pass! \\n\\nHill and water under sky, \\n\\nPass them by! Pass them by! \\n\\n\\n\\nStill round the corner there may wait \\nA new road or a secret gate, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd though we pass them by today, \\n\\nTomorrow we may come this way \\nAnd take the hidden paths that run \\nTowards the Moon or to the Sun. \\n\\nApple, thorn, and nut and sloe, \\n\\nLet them go! Let them go! \\n\\nSand and stone and pool and dell, \\n\\nFare you well! Fare you well! \\n\\nHome is behind, the world ahead, \\n\\nAnd there are many paths to tread \\nThrough shadows to the edge of night, \\n\\nUntil the stars are all alight. \\n\\nThen world behind and home ahead, \\n\\nWe\\'ll wander back to home and bed. \\n\\nMist and twilight, cloud and shade, \\n\\nAway shall fade! Away shall fade! \\n\\nFire and lamp, and meat and bread, \\n\\nAnd then to bed! And then to bed! \\n\\nThe song ended. \\'And now to bed! And now to bed!\\' sang Pippin in a high \\nvoice. \\n\\n\\'Hush!\\' said Frodo. \\'I think I hear hoofs again.\\' \\n\\nThey slopped suddenly and stood as silent as tree-shadows, listening. \\n\\nThere was a sound of hoofs in the lane, some way behind, but coming slow and \\nclear down the wind. Quickly and quietly they slipped off the path, and ran \\ninto the deeper shade under the oak-trees. \\n\\n\\'Don\\'t let us go too far!\\' said Frodo. \\'I don\\'t want to be seen, but I \\nwant to see if it is another Black Rider.\\' \\n\\n\\'Very well!\\' said Pippin. \\'But don\\'t forget the sniffing!\\' \\n\\nThe hoofs drew nearer. They had no time to find any hiding-place better \\nthan the general darkness under the trees; Sam and Pippin crouched behind a \\nlarge tree-bole, while Frodo crept back a few yards towards the lane. It \\nshowed grey and pale, a line of fading light through the wood. Above it the \\nstars were thick in the dim sky, but there was no moon. \\n\\nThe sound of hoofs stopped. As Frodo watched he saw something dark pass \\nacross the lighter space between two trees, and then halt. It looked like \\nthe black shade of a horse led by a smaller black shadow. The black shadow \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstood close to the point where they had left the path, and it swayed from \\nside to side. Frodo thought he heard the sound of snuffling. The shadow bent \\nto the ground, and then began to crawl towards him. \\n\\nOnce more the desire to slip on the Ring came over Frodo; but this time \\nit was stronger than before. So strong that, almost before he realized what \\nhe was doing, his hand was groping in his pocket. But at that moment there \\ncame a sound like mingled song and laughter. Clear voices rose and fell in \\nthe starlit air. The black shadow straightened up and retreated. It climbed \\non to the shadowy horse and seemed to vanish across the lane into the \\ndarkness on the other side. Frodo breathed again. \\n\\n\\'Elves!\\' exclaimed Sam in a hoarse whisper. \\'Elves, sir!\\' He would have \\nburst out of the trees and dashed off towards the voices, if they had not \\npulled him back. \\n\\n\\'Yes, it is Elves,\\' said Frodo. \\'One can meet them sometimes in the \\nWoody End. They don\\'t live in the Shire, but they wander into it in Spring \\nand Autumn, out of their own lands away beyond the Tower Hills. I am \\nthankful that they do! You did not see, but that Black Rider stopped just \\nhere and was actually crawling towards us when the song began. As soon as he \\nheard the voices he slipped away.\\' \\n\\n\\'What about the Elves?\\' said Sam, too excited to trouble about the \\nrider. \\'Can\\'t we go and see them?\\' \\n\\n\\'Listen! They are coming this way,\\' said Frodo. \\'We have only to wait.\\' \\n\\nThe singing drew nearer. One clear voice rose now above the others. It was \\nsinging in the fair elven-tongue, of which Frodo knew only a little, and the \\nothers knew nothing. Yet the sound blending with the melody seemed to shape \\nitself in their thought into words which they only partly understood. This \\nwas the song as Frodo heard it: \\n\\n\\n\\nSnow-white! Snow-white! O Lady clear! \\nO Queen beyond the Western Seas! \\n\\nO Light to us that wander here \\n\\n\\n\\nAmid the world of woven trees! \\n\\n\\n\\nGilthoniel! O Elbereth! \\n\\nClear are thy eyes and bright thy breath! \\nSnow-white! Snow-white! We sing to thee \\nIn a far land beyond the Sea. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nO stars that in the Sunless Year \\n\\nWith shining hand by her were sawn, \\n\\nIn windy fields now bright and clear \\n\\nWe see your silver blossom blown! \\n\\nO Elbereth! Gilthoniel! \\n\\nWe still remember, we who dwell \\n\\nIn this far land beneath the trees, \\n\\nThy starlight on the Western Seas. \\n\\nThe song ended. These are High Elves! They spoke the name of \\nElbereth!\\' said Frodo in amazement, \\'Few of that fairest folk are ever seen \\nin the Shire. Not many now remain in Middle-earth, east of the Great Sea. \\nThis is indeed a strange chance!\\' \\n\\nThe hobbits sat in shadow by the wayside. Before long the Elves came \\ndown the lane towards the valley. They passed slowly, and the hobbits could \\nsee the starlight glimmering on their hair and in their eyes. They bore no \\nlights, yet as they walked a shimmer, like the light of the moon above the \\nrim of the hills before it rises, seemed to fall about their feet. They were \\nnow silent, and as the last Elf passed he turned and looked towards the \\nhobbits and laughed. \\n\\n\\'Hail, Frodo!\\' he cried. \\'You are abroad late. Or are you perhaps \\nlost?\\' Then he called aloud to the others, and all the company stopped and \\ngathered round. \\n\\n\\'This is indeed wonderful!\\' they said. \\'Three hobbits in a wood at \\nnight! We have not seen such a thing since Bilbo went away. What is the \\nmeaning of it?\\' \\n\\n\\'The meaning of it, fair people,\\' said Frodo, \\'is simply that we seem \\nto be going the same way as you are. I like walking under the stars. But I \\nwould welcome your company.\\' \\n\\n\\'But we have no need of other company, and hobbits are so dull,\\' they \\nlaughed. \\'And how do you know that we go the same way as you, for you do \\nnot \\n\\nknow whither we are going?\\' \\n\\n\\'And how do you know my name?\\' asked Frodo in return. \\n\\n\\'We know many things,\\' they said. \\'We have seen you often before with \\nBilbo, though you may not have seen us.\\' \\n\\n\\'Who are you, and who is your lord?\\' asked Frodo. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'I am Gildor,\\' answered their leader, the Elf who had first hailed him. \\n\\n\\'Gildor Inglorion of the House of Finrod. We are Exiles, and most of our \\nkindred have long ago departed and we too are now only tarrying here a \\nwhile, ere we return over the Great Sea. But some of our kinsfolk dwell \\nstill in peace in Rivendell. Come now, Frodo, tell us what you are doing? \\n\\nFor we see that there is some shadow of fear upon you.\\' \\n\\n\\'O Wise People!\\' interrupted Pippin eagerly. \\'Tell us about the Black \\nRiders!\\' \\n\\n\\'Black Riders?\\' they said in low voices. \\'Why do you ask about Black \\nRiders?\\' \\n\\n\\'Because two Black Riders have overtaken us today, or one has done so \\ntwice,\\' said Pippin; \\'only a little while ago he slipped away as you drew \\nnear.\\' \\n\\nThe Elves did not answer at once, but spoke together softly in their \\nown tongue. At length Gildor turned to the hobbits. \\'We will not speak of \\nthis here,\\' he said. \\'We think you had best come now with us. It is not our \\ncustom, but for this time we will lake you on our road, and you shall lodge \\nwith us tonight, if you will.\\' \\n\\n\\'O Fair Folk! This is good fortune beyond my hope,\\' said Pippin. Sam \\nwas speechless. \\'I thank you indeed, Gildor Inglorion,\\' said Frodo bowing. \\n\\'Elen snla l(r)menn\\' omentielvo, a star shines on the hour of our meeting,\\' he \\nadded in the high-elven speech. \\n\\n\\'Be careful, friends!\\' cried Gildor laughing. \\'Speak no secrets! Here \\nis a scholar in the Ancient Tongue. Bilbo was a good master. Hail, \\nElf-friend!\\' he said, bowing to Frodo. \\'Come now with your friends and join \\nour company! You had best walk in the middle so that you may not stray. You \\nmay be weary before we halt.\\' \\n\\n\\'Why? Where are you going?\\' asked Frodo. \\n\\n\\'For tonight we go to the woods on the hills above Woodhall. It is some \\nmiles, but you shall have rest at the end of it, and it will shorten your \\njourney tomorrow.\\' \\n\\nThey now marched on again in silence, and passed like shadows and faint \\nlights: for Elves (even more than hobbits) could walk when they wished \\nwithout sound or footfall. Pippin soon began to feel sleepy, and staggered \\nonce or twice; but each time a tall Elf at his side put out his arm and \\nsaved him from a fall. Sam walked along at Frodo\\'s side, as if in a dream, \\nwith an expression on his face half of fear and half of astonished joy. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe woods on either side became denser; the trees were now younger and \\nthicker; and as the lane went lower, running down into a fold of the hills, \\nthere were many deep brakes of hazel on the rising slopes at either hand. At \\nlast the Elves turned aside from the path. A green ride lay almost unseen \\nthrough the thickets on the right; and this they followed as it wound away \\nback up the wooded slopes on to the top of a shoulder of the hills that \\nstood out into the lower land of the river -valley. Suddenly they came out of \\nthe shadow of the trees, and before them lay a wide space of grass, grey \\nunder the night. On three sides the woods pressed upon it; but eastward the \\nground fell steeply and the tops of the dark trees, growing at the bottom of \\nthe slope, were below their feet. Beyond, the low lands lay dim and flat \\nunder the stars. Nearer at hand a few lights twinkled in the village of \\nWoodhall. \\n\\nThe Elves sat on the grass and spoke together in soft voices; they \\nseemed to take no further notice of the hobbits. Frodo and his companions \\nwrapped themselves in cloaks and blankets, and drowsiness stole over them. \\nThe night grew on, and the lights in the valley went out. Pippin fell \\nasleep, pillowed on a green hillock. \\n\\nAway high in the East swung Remmirath, the Netted Stars, and slowly \\nabove the mists red Borgil rose, glowing like a jewel of fire. Then by some \\nshift of airs all the mist was drawn away like a veil, and there leaned up, \\nas he climbed over the rim of the world, the Swordsman of the Sky, \\nMenelvagor with his shining belt. The Elves all burst into song. Suddenly \\nunder the trees a fire sprang up with a red light. \\n\\n\\'Come!\\' the Elves called to the hobbits. \\'Come! Now is the time for \\nspeech and merriment!\\' \\n\\nPippin sat up and rubbed his eyes. He shivered. \\'There is a fire in the \\nhall, and food for hungry guests,\\' said an Elf standing before him. \\n\\nAt the south end of the greensward there was an opening. There the \\ngreen floor ran on into the wood, and formed a wide space like a hall, \\nroofed by the boughs of trees. Their great trunks ran like pillars down each \\nside. In the middle there was a wood-fire blazing, and upon the tree-pillars \\ntorches with lights of gold and silver were burning steadily. The Elves sat \\nround the fire upon the grass or upon the sawn rings of old trunks. Some \\nwent to and fro bearing cups and pouring drink; others brought food on \\nheaped plates and dishes. \\n\\n\\'This is poor fare,\\' they said to the hobbits; \\'for we are lodging in \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe greenwood far from our halls. If ever you are our guests at home, we \\nwill treat you better.\\' \\n\\n\\'It seems to me good enough for a birthday-party,\\' said Frodo. \\n\\nPippin afterwards recalled little of either food or drink, for his mind \\nwas filled with the light upon the elf-faces, and the sound of voices so \\nvarious and so beautiful that he felt in a waking dream. But he remembered \\nthat there was bread, surpassing the savour of a fair white loaf to one who \\nis starving; and fruits sweet as wildberries and richer than the tended \\nfruits of gardens; he drained a cup that was filled with a fragrant draught, \\ncool as a clear fountain, golden as a summer afternoon. \\n\\nSam could never describe in words, nor picture clearly to himself, what \\nhe felt or thought that night, though it remained in his memory as one of \\nthe chief events of his life. The nearest he ever got was to say: \\'Well, \\nsir, if I could grow apples like that, I would call myself a gardener. But \\nit was the singing that went to my heart, if you know what I mean.\\' \\n\\nFrodo sat, eating, drinking, and talking with delight; but his mind was \\nchiefly on the words spoken. He knew a little of the elf-speech and listened \\neagerly. Now and again he spoke to those that served him and thanked them in \\ntheir own language. They smiled at him and said laughing: \\'Here is a jewel \\namong hobbits!\\' \\n\\nAfter a while Pippin fell fast asleep, and was lifted up and borne away \\nto a bower under the trees; there he was laid upon a soft bed and slept the \\nrest of the night away. Sam refused to leave his master. When Pippin had \\ngone, he came and sat curled up at Frodo\\'s feet, where at last he nodded and \\nclosed his eyes. Frodo remained long awake, talking with Gildor. \\n\\nThey spoke of many things, old and new, and Frodo questioned Gildor \\nmuch about happenings in the wide world outside the Shire. The tidings were \\nmostly sad and ominous: of gathering darkness, the wars of Men, and the \\nflight of the Elves. At last Frodo asked the question that was nearest to \\nhis heart: \\n\\n\\'Tell me, Gildor, have you ever seen Bilbo since he left us?\\' \\n\\nGildor smiled. \\'Yes,\\' he answered. \\'Twice. He said farewell to us on \\nthis very spot. But I saw him once again, far from here.\\' He would say no \\nmore about Bilbo, and Frodo fell silent. \\n\\n\\'You do not ask me or tell me much that concerns yourself, Frodo,\\' said \\nGildor. \\'But I already know a little, and I can read more in your face and \\nin the thought behind your questions. You are leaving the Shire, and yet you \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndoubt that you will find what you seek, or accomplish what you intend, or \\nthat you will ever return. Is not that so?\\' \\n\\n\\'It is,\\' said Frodo; \\'but I thought my going was a secret known only to \\nGandalf and my faithful Sam.\\' He looked down at Sam, who was snoring \\ngently. \\n\\n\\'The secret will not reach the Enemy from us,\\' said Gildor. \\n\\n\\'The Enemy?\\' said Frodo. \\'Then you know why I am leaving the Shire?\\' \\n\\n\\'I do not know for what reason the Enemy is pursuing you,\\' answered \\nGildor; \\'but I perceive that he is - strange indeed though that seems to me. \\n\\nAnd I warn you that peril is now both before you and behind you, and upon \\neither side.\\' \\n\\n\\'You mean the Riders? I feared that they were servants of the Enemy. \\nWhat are the Black Riders?\\' \\n\\n\\'Has Gandalf told you nothing?\\' \\n\\n\\'Nothing about such creatures.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then I think it is not for me to say more - lest terror should keep \\nyou from your journey. For it seems to me that you have set out only just in \\ntime, if indeed you are in time. You must now make haste, and neither stay \\nnor turn back; for the Shire is no longer any protection to you.\\' \\n\\n\\'I cannot imagine what information could be more terrifying than your \\nhints and warnings,\\' exclaimed Frodo. \\'I knew that danger lay ahead, of \\ncourse; but I did not expect to meet it in our own Shire. Can\\'t a hobbit \\nwalk from the Water to the River in peace?\\' \\n\\n\\'But it is not your own Shire,\\' said Gildor. \\'Others dwelt here before \\nhobbits were; and others will dwell here again when hobbits are no more. The \\nwide world is all about you: you can fence yourselves in, but you cannot for \\never fence it out.\\' \\n\\n\\'I know - and yet it has always seemed so safe and familiar. What can I \\ndo now? My plan was to leave the Shire secretly, and make my way to \\nRivendell; but now my footsteps are dogged, before ever I get to Buckland.\\' \\n\\n\\'I think you should still follow that plan,\\' said Gildor. \\'I do not \\nthink the Road will prove too hard for your courage. But if you desire \\nclearer counsel, you should ask Gandalf. I do not know the reason for your \\nflight, and therefore I do not know by what means your pursuers will assail \\nyou. These things Gandalf must know. I suppose that you will see him before \\nyou leave the Shire?\\' \\n\\n\\'I hope so. But that is another thing that makes me anxious. I have \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbeen expecting Gandalf for many days. He was to have come to Hobbiton at \\nthe \\n\\nlatest two nights ago; but he has never appeared. Now I am wondering what \\ncan have happened. Should I wait for him?\\' \\n\\nGildor was silent for a moment. \\'I do not like this news,\\' he said at \\nlast. \\'That Gandalf should be late, does not bode well. But it is said: Do \\nnot meddle in the affairs of Wizards, for they are subtle and quick to \\nanger. The choice is yours: to go or wait.\\' \\n\\n\\'And it is also said,\\' answered Frodo: \\'Go not to the Elves for \\ncounsel, for they will say both no and yes. \\' \\n\\n\\'Is it indeed?\\' laughed Gildor. \\'Elves seldom give unguarded advice, \\nfor advice is a dangerous gift, even from the wise to the wise, and all \\ncourses may run ill. But what would you? You have not told me all concerning \\nyourself; and how then shall I choose better than you? But if you demand \\nadvice, I will for friendship\\'s sake give it. I think you should now go at \\nonce, without delay; and if Gandalf does not come before you set out, then I \\nalso advise this: do not go alone. Take such friends as are trusty and \\nwilling. Now you should be grateful, for I do not give this counsel gladly. \\n\\nThe Elves have their own labours and their own sorrows, and they are little \\nconcerned with the ways of hobbits, or of any other creatures upon earth. \\n\\nOur paths cross theirs seldom, by chance or purpose. In this meeting there \\nmay be more than chance; but the purpose is not clear to me, and I fear to \\nsay too much.\\' \\n\\n\\'I am deeply grateful,\\' said Frodo; \\'but I wish you would tell me \\nplainly what the Black Riders are. If I take your advice I may not see \\nGandalf for a long while, and I ought to know what is the danger that \\npursues me.\\' \\n\\n\\'Is it not enough to know that they are servants of the Enemy?\\' \\nanswered Gildor. \\'Flee them! Speak no words to them! They are deadly. Ask no \\nmore of me! But my heart forbodes that, ere all is ended, you, Frodo son of \\nDrogo, will know more of these fell things than Gildor Inglorion. May \\nElbereth protect you!\\' \\n\\n\\'But where shall I find courage?\\' asked Frodo. \\'That is what I chiefly \\nneed.\\' \\n\\n\\'Courage is found in unlikely places,\\' said Gildor. \\'Be of good hope! \\n\\nSleep now! In the morning we shall have gone; but we will send our messages \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthrough the lands. The Wandering Companies shall know of your journey, \\nand \\n\\nthose that have power for good shall be on the watch. I name you Elf-friend; \\nand may the stars shine upon the end of your road! Seldom have we had such \\ndelight in strangers, and it is fair to hear words of the Ancient Speech \\nfrom the lips of other wanderers in the world.\\' \\n\\nFrodo felt sleep coming upon him, even as Gildor finished speaking. \\'I \\nwill sleep now,\\' he said; and the Elf led him to a bower beside Pippin, and \\nhe threw himself upon a bed and fell at once into a dreamless slumber. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 4 . A Short Cut to Mushrooms \\n\\n\\n\\nIn the morning Frodo woke refreshed. He was lying in a bower made by a \\nliving tree with branches laced and drooping to the ground; his bed was of \\nfern and grass, deep and soft and strangely fragrant. The sun was shining \\nthrough the fluttering leaves, which were still green upon the tree. He \\njumped up and went out. \\n\\nSam was sitting on the grass near the edge of the wood. Pippin was \\nstanding studying the sky and weather. There was no sign of the Elves. \\n\\n\\'They have left us fruit and drink, and bread,\\' said Pippin. \\'Come and \\nhave your breakfast. The bread tastes almost as good as it did last night. I \\ndid not want to leave you any, but Sam insisted.\\' \\n\\nFrodo sat down beside Sam and began to eat. \\'What is the plan for \\ntoday?\\' asked Pippin. \\n\\n\\'To walk to Bucklebury as quickly as possible,\\' answered Frodo, and \\ngave his attention to the food. \\n\\n\\'Do you think we shall see anything of those Riders?\\' asked Pippin \\ncheerfully. Under the morning sun the prospect of seeing a whole troop of \\nthem did not seem very alarming to him. \\n\\n\\'Yes, probably,\\' said Frodo, not liking the reminder. \\'But I hope to \\nget across the river without their seeing us.\\' \\n\\n\\'Did you find out anything about them from Gildor?\\' \\n\\n\\'Not much - only hints and riddles,\\' said Frodo evasively. \\'Did you ask \\nabout the sniffing?\\' \\n\\n\\'We didn\\'t discuss it,\\' said Frodo with his mouth full. \\n\\n\\'You should have. I am sure it is very important.\\' \\n\\n\\'In that case I am sure Gildor would have refused to explain it,\\' said \\nFrodo sharply. \\'And now leave me in peace for a bit! I don\\'t want to answer \\na string of questions while I am eating. I want to think!\\' \\n\\n\\'Good heavens!\\' said Pippin. \\'At breakfast?\\' He walked away towards the \\nedge of the green. \\n\\nFrom Frodo\\' s mind the bright morning - treacherously bright, he thought \\n- had not banished the fear of pursuit; and he pondered the words of Gildor. \\nThe merry voice of Pippin came to him. He was running on the green turf and \\nsinging. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'No! I could not!\\' he said to himself. \\'It is one thing to take my \\nyoung friends walking over the Shire with me, until we are hungry and weary, \\nand food and bed are sweet. To take them into exile, where hunger and \\nweariness may have no cure, is quite another - even if they are willing to \\ncome. The inheritance is mine alone. I don\\'t think I ought even to take \\nSam.\\' He looked at Sam Gamgee, and discovered that Sam was watching him. \\n\\n\\'Well, Sam!\\' he said. \\'What about it? I am leaving the Shire as soon as \\never I can - in fact I have made up my mind now not even to wait a day at \\nCrickhollow, if it can be helped.\\' \\n\\n\\'Very good, sir!\\' \\n\\n\\'You still mean to come with me?\\' \\n\\n\\'I do.\\' \\n\\n\\'It is going to be very dangerous, Sam. \\'It is already dangerous. Most \\nlikely neither of us will come back.\\' \\n\\n\\'If you don\\'t come back, sir, then I shan\\'t, that\\'s certain,\\' said Sam. \\n\\n\\'Don\\'t you leave him! they said to me. Leave him! I said. I never mean to. I \\nam going with him, if he climbs to the Moon, and if any of those Black \\nRulers try to stop him, they\\'ll have Sam Gamgee to reckon with, I said. They \\nlaughed.\\' \\n\\n\\'Who are they, and what are you talking about?\\' \\n\\n\\'The Elves, sir. We had some talk last night; and they seemed to know \\nyou were going away, so I didn\\'t see the use of denying it. Wonderful folk, \\nElves, sir! Wonderful!\\' \\n\\n\\'They are,\\' said Frodo. \\'Do you like them still, now you have had a \\ncloser view?\\' \\n\\n\\'They seem a bit above my likes and dislikes, so to speak,\\' answered \\nSam slowly. \\'It don\\'t seem to matter what I think about them. They are quite \\ndifferent from what I expected - so old and young, and so gay and sad, as it \\nwere.\\' \\n\\nFrodo looked at Sam rather startled, half expecting to see some outward \\nsign of the odd change that seemed to have come over him. It did not sound \\nlike the voice of the old Sam Gamgee that he thought he knew. But it looked \\nlike the old Sam Gamgee sitting there, except that his face was unusually \\nthoughtful. \\n\\n\\'Do you feel any need to leave the Shire now - now that your wish to \\nsee them has come true already?\\' he asked. \\n\\n\\'Yes, sir. I don\\'t know how to say it, but after last night I feel \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndifferent. I seem to see ahead, in a kind of way. I know we are going to \\ntake a very long road, into darkness; but I know I can\\'t turn back. It isn\\'t \\nto see Elves now, nor dragons, nor mountains, that I want - 1 don\\'t rightly \\nknow what I want: but I have something to do before the end, and it lies \\nahead, not in the Shire. I must see it through, sir, if you understand me.\\' \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t altogether. But I understand that Gandalf chose me a good \\ncompanion. I am content. We will go together.\\' \\n\\nFrodo finished his breakfast in silence. Then standing up he looked \\nover the land ahead, and called to Pippin. \\n\\n\\'All ready to start?\\' he said as Pippin ran up. \\'We must be getting off \\nat once. We slept late; and there are a good many miles to go.\\' \\n\\n\\'You slept late, you mean,\\' said Pippin. \\'I was up long before; and we \\nare only waiting for you to finish eating and thinking.\\' \\n\\n\\'I have finished both now. And I am going to make for Bucklebury Ferry \\nas quickly as possible. I am not going out of the way, back to the road we \\nleft last night: I am going to cut straight across country from here.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then you are going to fly,\\' said Pippin. \\'You won\\'t cut straight on \\nfoot anywhere in this country.\\' \\n\\n\\'We can cut straighter than the road anyway,\\' answered Frodo. \\'The \\nFerry is east from Woodhall; but the hard road curves away to the left -you \\ncan see a bend of it away north over there. It goes round the north end of \\nthe Marish so as to strike the causeway from the Bridge above Stock. But \\nthat is miles out of the way. We could save a quarter of the distance if we \\nmade a line for the Ferry from where we stand.\\' \\n\\n\\'Short cuts make long delays, \\' argued Pippin. \\'The country is rough \\nround here, and there are bogs and all kinds of difficulties down in the \\nMarish -I know the land in these parts. And if you are worrying about Black \\nRiders, I can\\'t see that it is any worse meeting them on a road than in a \\nwood or a field.\\' \\n\\n\\'It is less easy to find people in the woods and fields,\\' answered \\nFrodo. \\'And if you are supposed to be on the road, there is some chance that \\nyou will be looked for on the road and not off it.\\' \\n\\n\\'All right!\\' said Pippin. \\'I will follow you into every bog and ditch. \\n\\nBut it is hard! I had counted on passing the Golden Perch at Stock before \\nsundown. The best beer in the Eastfarthing, or used to be: it is a long time \\nsince I tasted it.\\' \\n\\n\\'That settles it!\\' said Frodo. \\'Short cuts make delays, but inns make \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nlonger ones. At all costs we must keep you away from the Golden Perch. We \\nwant to get to Bucklebury before dark. What do you say, Sam?\\' \\n\\n\\'I will go along with you, Mr. Frodo,\\' said Sam (in spite of private \\nmisgiving and a deep regret for the best beer in the Eastfarthing). \\n\\nThen if we are going to toil through bog and briar, let\\'s go now!\\' \\nsaid Pippin. \\n\\nIt was already nearly as hot as it had been the day before; but clouds \\nwere beginning to come up from the West. It looked likely to turn to rain. \\n\\nThe hobbits scrambled down a steep green bank and plunged into the thick \\ntrees below. Their course had been chosen to leave Woodhall to their left, \\nand to cut slanting through the woods that clustered along the eastern side \\nof the hills, until they reached the flats beyond. Then they could make \\nstraight for the Ferry over country that was open, except for a few ditches \\nand fences. Frodo reckoned they had eighteen miles to go in a straight line. \\n\\nHe soon found that the thicket was closer and more tangled than it had \\nappeared. There were no paths in the undergrowth, and they did not get on \\nvery fast. When they had struggled to the bottom of the bank, they found a \\nstream running down from the hills behind in a deeply dug bed with steep \\nslippery sides overhung with brambles. Most inconveniently it cut across the \\nline they had chosen. They could not jump over it, nor indeed get across it \\nat all without getting wet, scratched, and muddy. They halted, wondering \\nwhat to do. \\'First check!\\' said Pippin, smiling grimly. \\n\\nSam Gamgee looked back. Through an opening in the trees he caught a \\nglimpse of the top of the green bank from which they had climbed down. \\n\\n\\'Look!\\' he said, clutching Frodo by the arm. They all looked, and on \\nthe edge high above them they saw against the sky a horse standing. Beside \\nit stooped a black figure. \\n\\nThey at once gave up any idea of going back. Frodo led the way, and \\nplunged quickly into the thick bushes beside the stream. \\'Whew!\\' he said to \\nPippin. \\'We were both right! The short cut has gone crooked already; but we \\ngot under cover only just in time. You\\'ve got sharp ears, Sam: can you hear \\nanything coming?\\' \\n\\nThey stood still, almost holding their breath as they listened; but \\nthere was no sound of pursuit. \\'I don\\'t fancy he would try bringing his \\nhorse down that bank,\\' said Sam. \\'But I guess he knows we came down it. We \\nhad better be going on.\\' \\n\\nGoing on was not altogether easy. They had packs to carry, and the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbushes and brambles were reluctant to let them through. They were cut off \\nfrom the wind by the ridge behind, and the air was still and stuffy. When \\nthey forced their way at last into more open ground, they were hot and tired \\nand very scratched, and they were also no longer certain of the direction in \\nwhich they were going. The banks of the stream sank, as it reached the \\nlevels and became broader and shallower, wandering off towards the Marish \\nand the River. \\n\\n\\'Why, this is the Stock-brook!\\' said Pippin. \\'If we are going to try \\nand get back on to our course, we must cross at once and bear right.\\' \\n\\nThey waded the stream, and hurried over a wide open space, rush-grown \\nand treeless, on the further side. Beyond that they came again to a belt of \\ntrees: tall oaks, for the most part, with here and there an elm tree or an \\nash. The ground was fairly level, and there was little undergrowth; but the \\ntrees were loo close for them to see far ahead. The leaves blew upwards in \\nsudden gusts of wind, and spots of rain began to fall from the overcast sky. \\nThen the wind died away and the rain came streaming down. They trudged \\nalong \\n\\nas fast as they could, over patches of grass, and through thick drifts of \\nold leaves; and all about them the rain pattered and trickled. They did not \\ntalk, but kept glancing back, and from side to side. \\n\\nAfter half an hour Pippin said: \\'I hope we have not turned too much \\ntowards the south, and are not walking longwise through this wood! It is not \\na very broad belt --I should have said no more than a mile at the widest - \\nand we ought to have been through it by now.\\' \\n\\n\\'It is no good our starting to go in zig-zags,\\' said Frodo. \\'That won\\'t \\nmend matters. Let us keep on as we are going! I am not sure that I want to \\ncome out into the open yet.\\' \\n\\nThey went on for perhaps another couple of miles. Then the sun gleamed \\nout of ragged clouds again and the rain lessened. It was now past mid-day, \\nand they felt it was high time for lunch. They halted under an elm tree: its \\nleaves though fast turning yellow were still thick, and the ground at its \\nfeel was fairly dry and sheltered. When they came to make their meal, they \\nfound that the Elves had filled their bottles with a clear drink, pale \\ngolden in colour: it had the scent of a honey made of many flowers, and was \\nwonderfully refreshing. Very soon they were laughing, and snapping their \\nfingers at rain, and at Black Riders. The last few miles, they felt, would \\nsoon be behind them. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrodo propped his back against the tree-trunk, and closed his eyes. Sam \\nand Pippin sat near, and they began to hum, and then to sing softly: \\n\\nHo! Ho! Ho! to the bottle I go \\n\\nTo heal my heart and drown my woe. \\n\\nRain may fall and wind may blow, \\n\\nAnd many miles be still to go, \\n\\nBut under a tall tree I will lie, \\n\\nAnd let the clouds go sailing by. \\n\\nHo! Ho! Ho! they began again louder. They stopped short suddenly. Frodo \\nsprang to his feet. A long-drawn wail came down the wind, like the cry of \\nsome evil and lonely creature. It rose and fell, and ended on a high \\npiercing note. Even as they sat and stood, as if suddenly frozen, it was \\nanswered by another cry, fainter and further off, but no less chilling to \\nthe blood. There was then a silence, broken only by the sound of the wind in \\nthe leaves. \\n\\n\\'And what do you think that was?\\' Pippin asked at last, trying to speak \\nlightly, but quavering a little. \\'If it was a bird, it was one that I never \\nheard in the Shire before.\\' \\n\\n\\'It was not bird or beast,\\' said Frodo. \\'It was a call, or a signal -- \\nthere were words in that cry, though I could not catch them. But no hobbit \\nhas such a voice.\\' \\n\\nNo more was said about it. They were all thinking of the Riders, but no \\none spoke of them. They were now reluctant either to stay or go on; but \\nsooner or later they had got to get across the open country to the Ferry, \\nand it was best to go sooner and in daylight. In a few moments they had \\nshouldered their packs again and were off. \\n\\nBefore long the wood came to a sudden end. Wide grass-lands stretched \\nbefore them. They now saw that they had, in fact, turned too much to the \\nsouth. Away over the flats they could glimpse the low hill of Bucklebury \\nacross the River, but it was now to their left. Creeping cautiously out from \\nthe edge of the trees, they set off across the open as quickly as they \\ncould. \\n\\nAt first they felt afraid, away from the shelter of the wood. Far back \\nbehind them stood the high place where they had breakfasted. Frodo half \\nexpected to see the small distant figure of a horseman on the ridge dark \\nagainst the sky; but there was no sign of one. The sun escaping from the \\nbreaking clouds, as it sank towards the hills they had left, was now shining \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbrightly again. Their fear left them, though they still felt uneasy. But the \\nland became steadily more tame and well-ordered. Soon they came into \\nwell-tended fields and meadows: there were hedges and gates and dikes for \\ndrainage. Everything seemed quiet and peaceful, just an ordinary corner of \\nthe Shire. Their spirits rose with every step. The line of the River grew \\nnearer; and the Black Riders began to seem like phantoms of the woods now \\nleft far behind. \\n\\nThey passed along the edge of a huge turnip-field, and came to a stout \\ngate. Beyond it a rutted lane ran between low well-laid hedges towards a \\ndistant clump of trees. Pippin stopped. \\n\\n\\'I know these fields and this gate!\\' he said. \\'This is Bamfurlong, old \\nFarmer Maggot\\'s land. That\\'s his farm away there in the trees.\\' \\n\\n\\'One trouble after another!\\' said Frodo, looking nearly as much alarmed \\nas if Pippin had declared the lane was the slot leading to a dragon\\'s den. \\n\\nThe others looked at him in surprise. \\n\\n\\'What\\'s wrong with old Maggot?\\' asked Pippin. \\'He\\'s a good friend to \\nall the Brandy bucks. Of course he\\'s a terror to trespassers, and keeps \\nferocious dogs - but after all, folk down here are near the border and have \\nto be more on their guard.\\' \\n\\n\\'I know,\\' said Frodo. \\'But all the same,\\' he added with a shamefaced \\nlaugh, \\'I am terrified of him and his dogs. I have avoided his farm for \\nyears and years. He caught me several times trespassing after mushrooms, \\nwhen I was a youngster at Brandy Hall. On the last occasion he beat me, and \\nthen took me and showed me to his dogs. \"See, lads,\" he said, \"next time \\nthis young varmint sets foot on my land, you can eat him. Now see him off!\" \\nThey chased me all the way to the Ferry. I have never got over the fright - \\nthough I daresay the beasts knew their business and would not really have \\ntouched me.\\' \\n\\nPippin laughed. \\'Well, it\\'s time you made it up. Especially if you are \\ncoming back to live in Buckland. Old Maggot is really a stout fellow - if \\nyou leave his mushrooms alone. Fet\\'s get into the lane and then we shan\\'t be \\ntrespassing. If we meet him, I\\'ll do the talking. He is a friend of Merry\\'s, \\nand I used to come here with him a good deal at one time.\\' \\n\\nThey went along the lane, until they saw the thatched roofs of a large \\nhouse and farm-buildings peeping out among the trees ahead. The Maggots, \\nand \\n\\nthe Puddifoots of Stock, and most of the inhabitants of the Marish, were \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhouse-dwellers; and this farm was stoutly built of brick and had a high wall \\nall round it. There was a wide wooden gate opening out of the wall into the \\nlane. \\n\\nSuddenly as they drew nearer a terrific baying and barking broke out, \\nand a loud voice was heard shouting: \\'Grip! Fang! Wolf! Come on, lads!\\' \\n\\nFrodo and Sam stopped dead, but Pippin walked on a few paces. The gate \\nopened and three huge dogs came pelting out into the lane, and dashed \\ntowards the travellers, barking fiercely. They took no notice of Pippin; but \\nSam shrank against the wall, while two wolvish-looking dogs sniffed at him \\nsuspiciously, and snarled if he moved. The largest and most ferocious of the \\nthree halted in front of Frodo, bristling and growling. \\n\\nThrough the gate there now appeared a broad thick -set hobbit with a \\nround red face. \\'Hallo! Hallo! And who may you be, and what may you be \\nwanting?\\' he asked. \\n\\n\\'Good afternoon, Mr. Maggot!\\' said Pippin. \\n\\nThe farmer looked at him closely. \\'Well, if it isn\\'t Master Pippin - \\nMr. Peregrin Took, I should say!\\' he cried, changing from a scowl to a grin. \\n\\'It\\'s a long time since I saw you round here. It\\'s lucky for you that I know \\nyou. I was just going out to set my dogs on any strangers. There are some \\nfunny things going on today. Of course, we do get queer folk wandering in \\nthese parts at times. Too near the River,\\' he said, shaking his head. \\'But \\nthis fellow was the most outlandish I have ever set eyes on. He won\\'t cross \\nmy land without leave a second time, not if I can stop it.\\' \\n\\n\\'What fellow do you mean?\\' asked Pippin. \\n\\n\\'Then you haven\\'t seen him?\\' said the farmer. \\'He went up the lane \\ntowards the causeway not a long while back. He was a funny customer and \\nasking funny questions. But perhaps you\\'ll come along inside, and we\\'ll pass \\nthe news more comfortable. I\\'ve a drop of good ale on tap, if you and your \\nfriends are willing, Mr. Took.\\' \\n\\nIt seemed plain that the farmer would tell them more, if allowed to do \\nit in his own time and fashion, so they all accepted the invitation. \\'What \\nabout the dogs?\\' asked Frodo anxiously. \\n\\nThe farmer laughed. \\'They won\\'t harm you - not unless I tell \\'em to. \\n\\nHere, Grip! Fang! Heel!\\' he cried. \\'Heel, Wolf!\\' To the relief of Frodo and \\nSam, the dogs walked away and let them go free. \\n\\nPippin introduced the other two to the farmer. \\'Mr. Frodo Baggins,\\' he \\nsaid. \\'You may not remember him, but he used to live at Brandy Hall.\\' At the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nname Baggins the farmer started, and gave Frodo a sharp glance. For a moment \\nFrodo thought that the memory of stolen mushrooms had been aroused, and \\nthat \\n\\nthe dogs would be told to see him off. But Farmer Maggot took him by the \\narm. \\n\\n\\'Well, if that isn\\'t queerer than ever?\\' he exclaimed. \\'Mr. Baggins is \\nit? Come inside! We must have a talk.\\' \\n\\nThey went into the farmer\\'s kitchen, and sat by the wide fire-place. \\n\\nMrs. Maggot brought out beer in a huge jug, and filled four large mugs. It \\nwas a good brew, and Pippin found himself more than compensated for \\nmissing \\n\\nthe Golden Perch. Sam sipped his beer suspiciously. He had a natural \\nmistrust of the inhabitants of other parts of the Shire; and also he was not \\ndisposed to be quick friends with anyone who had beaten his master, however \\nlong ago. \\n\\nAfter a few remarks about the weather and the agricultural prospects \\n(which were no worse than usual), Farmer Maggot put down his mug and \\nlooked \\n\\nat them all in turn. \\n\\n\\'Now, Mr. Peregrin,\\' he said, \\'where might you be coming from, and \\nwhere might you be going to? Were you coming to visit\\' me? For, if so, you \\nhad gone past my gate without my seeing you.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, no,\\' answered Pippin. \\'To tell you the truth, since you have \\nguessed it, we got into the lane from the other end: we had come over your \\nfields. But that was quite by accident. We lost our way in the woods, back \\nnear Woodhall, trying to take a short cut to the Ferry.\\' \\n\\n\\'If you were in a hurry, the road would have served you better,\\' said \\nthe farmer. \\'But I wasn\\'t worrying about that. You have leave to walk over \\nmy land, if you have a mind, Mr. Peregrin. And you, Mr. Baggins - though I \\ndaresay you still like mushrooms.\\' He laughed. \\'Ah yes, I recognized the \\nname. I recollect the time when young Frodo Baggins was one of the worst \\nyoung rascals of Buckland. But it wasn\\'t mushrooms I was thinking of. I had \\njust heard the name Baggins before you turned up. What do you think that \\nfunny customer asked me?\\' \\n\\nThey waited anxiously for him to go on. \\'Well,\\' the farmer continued, \\napproaching his point with slow relish, \\'he came riding on a big black horse \\nin at the gate, which happened to be open, and right up to my door. All \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nblack he was himself, too, and cloaked and hooded up, as if he did not want \\nto be known. \"Now what in the Shire can he want?\" I thought to myself. We \\ndon\\'t see many of the Big Folk over the border; and anyway I had never heard \\nof any like this black fellow. \\n\\n\\' \"Good-day to you!\" I says, going out to him. \"This lane don\\'t lead \\nanywhere, and wherever you may be going, your quickest way will be back to \\nthe road.\" I didn\\'t like the looks of him; and when Grip came out, he took \\none sniff and let out a yelp as if he had been slung: he put down his tail \\nand bolted off howling. The black fellow sat quite still. \\n\\n\\' \"I come from yonder,\" he said, slow and stiff-like, pointing back \\nwest, over my fields, if you please. \"Have you seen Baggins? \" he asked in a \\nqueer voice, and bent down towards me. I could not see any face, for his \\nhood fell down so low; and I felt a sort of shiver down my back. But I did \\nnot see why he should come riding over my land so bold. \\n\\n\\' \"Be off!\" I said. \"There are no Bagginses here. You\\'re in the wrong \\npart of the Shire. You had better go back west to Hobbiton - but you can go \\nby road this time.\" \\n\\n\\' \"Baggins has left,\" he answered in a whisper. \"He is coming. He is \\nnot far away. I wish to find him. If he passes will you tell me? I will come \\nback with gold.\" \\n\\n\\' \"No you won\\'t,\" I said. \"You\\'ll go back where you belong, double \\nquick. I give you one minute before I call all my dogs.\" \\n\\n\\'He gave a sort of hiss. It might have been laughing, and it might not. \\n\\nThen he spurred his great horse right at me, and I jumped out of the way \\nonly just in time. I called the dogs, but he swung off, and rode through the \\ngate and up the lane towards the causeway like a bolt of thunder. What do \\nyou think of that?\\' \\n\\nFrodo sat for a moment looking at the fire, but his only thought was \\nhow on earth would they reach the Ferry. \\'I don\\'t know what to think,\\' he \\nsaid at last. \\n\\n\\'Then I\\'ll tell you what to think,\\' said Maggot. \\'You should never have \\ngone mixing yourself up with Hobbiton folk, Mr. Frodo. Folk are queer up \\nthere.\\' Sam stirred in his chair, and looked at the farmer with an \\nunfriendly eye. \\'But you were always a reckless lad. When I heard you had \\nleft the Brandybucks and gone off to that old Mr. Bilbo, I said that you \\nwere going to find trouble. Mark my words, this all comes of those strange \\ndoings of Mr. Bilbo\\'s. His money was got in some strange fashion in foreign \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nparts, they say. Maybe there is some that want to know what has become of \\nthe gold and jewels that he buried in the hill of Hobbiton, as I hear?\\' \\n\\nFrodo said nothing: the shrewd guesses of the farmer were rather \\ndisconcerting. \\n\\n\\'Well, Mr. Frodo,\\' Maggot went on, \\'I\\'m glad that you\\'ve had the sense \\nto come back to Buckland. My advice is: stay there! And don\\'t get mixed up \\nwith these outlandish folk. You\\'ll have friends in these parts. If any of \\nthese black fellows come after you again, I\\'ll deal with them. I\\'ll say \\nyou\\'re dead, or have left the Shire, or anything you like. And that might be \\ntrue enough; for as like as not it is old Mr. Bilbo they want news of.\\' \\n\\n\\'Maybe you\\'re right,\\' said Frodo, avoiding the farmer\\'s eye and staring \\nat the fire. \\n\\nMaggot looked at him thoughtfully. \\'Well, I see you have ideas of your \\nown,\\' he said. \\'It is as plain as my nose that no accident brought you and \\nthat rider here on the same afternoon; and maybe my news was no great news \\nto you, after all. I am not asking you to tell me anything you have a mind \\nto keep to yourself; but I see you are in some kind of trouble. Perhaps you \\nare thinking it won\\'t be too easy to get to the Ferry without being caught?\\' \\n\\n\\'I was thinking so,\\' said Frodo. But we have got to try and get there; \\nand it won\\'t be done by sitting and thinking. Sol am afraid we must be \\ngoing. Thank you very much indeed for your kindness! I\\'ve been in terror of \\nyou and your dogs for over thirty years, Farmer Maggot, though you may laugh \\nto hear it. It\\'s a pity: for I\\'ve missed a good friend. And now I\\'m sorry to \\nleave so soon. But I\\'ll come back, perhaps, one day - if I get a chance.\\' \\n\\n\\'You\\'ll be welcome when you come,\\' said Maggot. \\'But now I\\'ve a notion. \\nIt\\'s near sundown already, and we are going to have our supper; for we \\nmostly go to bed soon after the Sun. If you and Mr. Peregrin and all could \\nstay and have a bite with us, we would be pleased!\\' \\n\\n\\'And so should we!\\' said Frodo. \\'But we must be going at once, I\\'m \\nafraid. Even now it will be dark before we can reach the Ferry.\\' \\n\\n\\'Ah! but wait a minute! I was going to say: after a bit of supper, I\\'ll \\ngel out a small waggon, and I\\'ll drive you all to the Ferry. That will save \\nyou a good step, and it might also save you trouble of another sort.\\' \\n\\nFrodo now accepted the invitation gratefully, to the relief of Pippin \\nand Sam. The sun was already behind the western hills, and the light was \\nfailing. Two of Maggot\\'s sons and his three daughters came in, and a \\ngenerous supper was laid on the large table. The kitchen was lit with \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncandles and the fire was mended. Mrs. Maggot hustled in and out. One or two \\nother hobbits belonging to the farm-household came in. In a short while \\nfourteen sat down to eat. There was beer in plenty, and a mighty dish of \\nmushrooms and bacon, besides much other solid farmhouse fare. The dogs lay \\nby the fire and gnawed rinds and cracked bones. \\n\\nWhen they had finished, the farmer and his sons went out with a lantern \\nand got the waggon ready. It was dark in the yard, when the guests came out. \\nThey threw their packs on board and climbed in. The farmer sat in the \\ndriving-seat, and whipped up his two stout ponies. His wife stood in the \\nlight of the open door. \\n\\n\\'You be careful of yourself. Maggot!\\' she called. \\'Don\\'t go arguing \\nwith any foreigners, and come straight back!\\' \\n\\n\\'I will!\\' said he, and drove out of the gate. There was now no breath \\nof wind stirring; the night was still and quiet, and a chill was in the air. \\n\\nThey went without lights and took it slowly. After a mile or two the lane \\ncame to an end, crossing a deep dike, and climbing a short slope up on to \\nthe high-banked causeway. \\n\\nMaggot got down and took a good look either way, north and south, but \\nnothing could be seen in the darkness, and there was not a sound in the \\nstill air. Thin strands of river -mist were hanging above the dikes, and \\ncrawling over the fields. \\n\\n\\'It\\'s going to be thick,\\' said Maggot; \\'but I\\'ll not light my lantern \\ntill I turn for home. We\\'ll hear anything on the road long before we meet it \\ntonight.\\' \\n\\nIt was five miles or more from Maggot\\'s lane to the Ferry. The hobbits \\nwrapped themselves up, but their ears were strained for any sound above the \\ncreak of the wheels and the slow clop of the ponies\\' hoofs. The waggon \\nseemed slower than a snail to Frodo. Beside him Pippin was nodding towards \\nsleep; but Sam was staring forwards into the rising fog. \\n\\nThey reached the entrance to the Ferry lane at last. It was marked by \\ntwo tall white posts that suddenly loomed up on their right. Farmer Maggot \\ndrew in his ponies and the waggon creaked to a halt. They were just \\nbeginning lo scramble out, when suddenly they heard what they had all been \\ndreading: hoofs on the road ahead. The sound was coming towards them. \\n\\nMaggot jumped down and stood holding the ponies\\' heads, and peering \\nforward into the gloom. Clip-clop, clip-clop came the approaching rider. The \\nfall of the hoofs sounded loud in the still, foggy air. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'You\\'d better be hidden, Mr. Frodo,\\' said Sam anxiously. \\'You get down \\nin the waggon and cover up with blankets, and we\\'ll send this rider to the \\nrightabouts!\\' He climbed out and went to the farmer\\'s side. Black Riders \\nwould have to ride over him to get near the waggon. \\n\\nClop-clop, clop-clop. The rider was nearly on them. \\n\\n\\'Hallo there!\\' called Farmer Maggot. The advancing hoofs stopped short. \\nThey thought they could dimly guess a dark cloaked shape in the mist, a yard \\nor two ahead. \\'Now then!\\' said the farmer, throwing the reins to Sam and \\nstriding forward. \\'Don\\'t you come a step nearer! What do you want, and where \\nare you going?\\' \\n\\n\\'I want Mr. Baggins. Have you seen him?\\' said a muffled voice - but the \\nvoice was the voice of Merry Brandybuck. A dark lantern was uncovered, and \\nits light fell on the astonished face of the farmer. \\n\\n\\'Mr. Merry!\\' he cried. \\n\\n\\'Yes, of course! Who did you think it was?\\' said Merry coming forward. \\n\\nAs he came out of the mist and their fears subsided, he seemed suddenly to \\ndiminish to ordinary hobbit-size. He was riding a pony, and a scarf was \\nswathed round his neck and over his chin to keep out the fog. \\n\\nFrodo sprang out of the waggon to greet him. \\'So there you are at \\nlast!\\' said Merry. \\'I was beginning to wonder if you would turn up at all \\ntoday, and I was just going back to supper. When it grew foggy I came across \\nand rode up towards Stock to see if you had fallen in any ditches. But I\\'m \\nblest if I know which way you have come. Where did you find them, Mr. \\nMaggot? In your duck-pond?\\' \\n\\n\\'No, I caught \\'em trespassing,\\' said the farmer, \\'and nearly set my \\ndogs on \\'em; but they\\'ll tell you all the story, I\\'ve no doubt. Now, if \\nyou\\'ll excuse me, Mr. Merry and Mr. Frodo and all, I\\'d best be turning for \\nhome. Mrs. Maggot will be worriting with the night getting thick.\\' \\n\\nHe backed the waggon into the lane and turned it. \\'Well, good night to \\nyou all,\\' he said. \\'It\\'s been a queer day, and no mistake. But all\\'s well as \\nends well; though perhaps we should not say that until we reach our own \\ndoors. I\\'ll not deny that I\\'ll be glad now when I do.\\' He lit his lanterns, \\nand got up. Suddenly he produced a large basket from under the seat. \\'I was \\nnearly forgetting,\\' he said. \\'Mrs. Maggot put this up for Mr. Baggins, with \\nher compliments.\\' He handed it down and moved off, followed by a chorus of \\nthanks and good-nights. \\n\\nThey watched the pale rings of light round his lanterns as they \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndwindled into the foggy night. Suddenly Frodo laughed: from the covered \\nbasket he held, the scent of mushrooms was rising. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 5 . A Conspiracy Unmasked \\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Now we had better get home ourselves,\\' said Merry. There\\'s something \\nfunny about all this, I see; but it must wait till we get in.\\' \\n\\nThey turned down the Ferry lane, which was straight and well-kept and \\nedged with large white- washed stones. In a hundred yards or so it brought \\nthem to the river -bank, where there was a broad wooden landing-stage. A \\nlarge flat ferry-boat was moored beside it. The white bollards near the \\nwater\\'s edge glimmered in the light of two lamps on high posts. Behind them \\nthe mists in the flat fields were now above the hedges; but the water before \\nthem was dark, with only a few curling wisps like steam among the reeds by \\nthe bank. There seemed to be less fog on the further side. \\n\\nMerry led the pony over a gangway on to the ferry, and the others \\nfollowed. Merry then pushed slowly off with a long pole. The Brandywine \\nflowed slow and broad before them. On the other side the bank was steep, and \\nup it a winding path climbed from the further landing. Lamps were twinkling \\nthere. Behind loomed up the Buck Hill; and out of it, through stray shrouds \\nof mist, shone many round windows, yellow and red. They were the windows \\nof \\n\\nBrandy Hall, the ancient home of the Brandy bucks. \\n\\nLong ago Gorhendad Oldbuck, head of the Oldbuck family, one of the \\noldest in the Marish or indeed in the Shire, had crossed the river, which \\nwas the original boundary of the land eastwards. He built (and excavated) \\nBrandy Hall, changed his name to Brandybuck, and settled down to become \\nmaster of what was virtually a small independent country. His family grew \\nand grew, and after his days continued to grow, until Brandy Hall occupied \\nthe whole of the low hill, and had three large front-doors, many side-doors, \\nand about a hundred windows. The Brandybucks and their numerous \\ndependants \\n\\nthen began to burrow, and later to build, all round about. That was the \\norigin of Buckland, a thickly inhabited strip between the river and the Old \\nForest, a sort of colony from the Shire. Its chief village was Bucklebury, \\nclustering in the banks and slopes behind Brandy Hall. \\n\\nThe people in the Marish were friendly with the Bucklanders, and the \\nauthority of the Master of the Hall (as the head of the Brandybuck family \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwas called) was still acknowledged by the farmers between Stock and Rushey. \\nBut most of the folk of the old Shire regarded the Bucklanders as peculiar, \\nhalf foreigners as it were. Though, as a matter of fact, they were not very \\ndifferent from the other hobbits of the Four Farthings. Except in one point: \\nthey were fond of boats, and some of them could swim. \\n\\nTheir land was originally unprotected from the East; but on that side \\nthey had built a hedge: the High Hay. It had been planted many generations \\nago, and was now thick and tail, for it was constantly tended. It ran all \\nthe way from Brandywine Bridge, in a big loop curving away from the river, \\nto Haysend (where the Withywindle flowed out of the Forest into the \\nBrandywine): well over twenty miles from end to end. But, of course, it was \\nnot a complete protection. The Forest drew close to the hedge in many \\nplaces. The Bucklanders kept their doors locked after dark, and that also \\nwas not usual in the Shire. \\n\\nThe ferry-boat moved slowly across the water. The Buckland shore drew \\nnearer. Sam was the only member of the party who had not been over the river \\nbefore. He had a strange feeling as the slow gurgling stream slipped by: his \\nold life lay behind in the mists, dark adventure lay in front. He scratched \\nhis head, and for a moment had a passing wish that Mr. Frodo could have gone \\non living quietly at Bag End. \\n\\nThe four hobbits stepped off the ferry. Merry was tying it up, and \\nPippin was already leading the pony up the path, when Sam (who had been \\nlooking back, as if to take farewell of the Shire) said in a hoarse whisper: \\n\\n\\'Look back, Mr. Frodo! Do you see anything?\\' \\n\\nOn the far stage, under the distant lamps, they could just make out a \\nfigure: it looked like a dark black bundle left behind. But as they looked \\nit seemed to move and sway this way and that, as if searching the ground. It \\nthen crawled, or went crouching, back into the gloom beyond the lamps. \\n\\n\\'What in the Shire is that?\\' exclaimed Merry. \\n\\n\\'Something that is following us,\\' said Frodo. \\'But don\\'t ask any more \\nnow! Let\\'s get away at once!\\' They hurried up the path to the top of the \\nbank, but when they looked back the far shore was shrouded in mist, and \\nnothing could be seen. \\n\\n\\'Thank goodness you don\\'t keep any boats on the west -bank!\\' said Frodo. \\n\\'Can horses cross the river?\\' \\n\\n\\'They can go twenty miles north to Brandywine Bridge - or they might \\nswim,\\' answered Merry. \\'Though I never heard of any horse swimming the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBrandywine. But what have horses to do with it?\\' I\\'ll tell you later. Let\\'s \\nget indoors and then we can talk.\\' \\n\\n\\'All right! You and Pippin know your way; so I\\'ll just ride on and tell \\nFatty Bolger that you are coming. We\\'ll see about supper and things.\\' \\n\\n\\'We had our supper early with Farmer Maggot,\\' said Frodo; \\'but we could \\ndo with another.\\' \\n\\n\\'You shall have it! Give me that basket!\\' said Merry, and rode ahead \\ninto the darkness. \\n\\nIt was some distance from the Brandywine to Frodo\\'s new house at \\nCrickhollow. They passed Buck Hill and Brandy Hall on their left, and on the \\noutskirts of Bucklebury struck the main road of Buckland that ran south from \\nthe Bridge. Half a mile northward along this they came to a lane opening on \\ntheir right. This they followed for a couple of miles as it climbed up and \\ndown into the country. \\n\\nAt last they came to a narrow gate in a thick hedge. Nothing could be \\nseen of the house in the dark: it stood back from the lane in the middle of \\na wide circle of lawn surrounded by a belt of low trees inside the outer \\nhedge. Frodo had chosen it, because it stood in an out-of-the-way corner of \\nthe country, and there were no other dwellings close by. You could get in \\nand out without being noticed. It had been built a long while before by the \\nBrandybucks, for the use of guests, or members of the family that wished to \\nescape from the crowded life of Brandy Hall for a time. It was an \\nold-fashioned countrified house, as much like a hobbit-hole as possible: it \\nwas long and low, with no upper storey; and it had a roof of turf, round \\nwindows, and a large round door. \\n\\nAs they walked lip the green path from the gate no light was visible; \\nthe windows were dark and shuttered. Frodo knocked on the door, and Fatty \\nBolger opened it. A friendly light streamed out. They slipped in quickly and \\nshut themselves and the light inside. They were in a wide hall with doors on \\neither side; in front of them a passage ran back down the middle of the \\nhouse. \\n\\n\\'Well, what do you think of it?\\' asked Merry coming up the passage. \\'We \\nhave done our best in a short time to make it look like home. After all \\nFatty and I only got here with the last cart-load yesterday.\\' \\n\\nFrodo looked round. It did look like home. Many of his own favourite \\nthings - or Bilbo\\'s things (they reminded him sharply of him in their new \\nselling) - were arranged as nearly as possible as they had been at Bag End. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was a pleasant, comfortable, welcoming place; and he found himself \\nwishing that he was really coming here to settle down in quiet retirement. \\n\\nIt seemed unfair to have put his friends to all this trouble; and he \\nwondered again how he was going to break the news to them that he must leave \\nthem so soon, indeed at once. Yet that would have to be done that very \\nnight, before they all went to bed. \\n\\n\\'It\\'s delightful!\\' he said with an effort. \\'I hardly feel that I have \\nmoved at all.\\' \\n\\nThe travellers hung up their cloaks, and piled their packs on the \\nfloor. Merry led them down the passage and threw open a door at the far end. \\nFirelight came out, and a puff of steam. \\n\\n\\'A bath!\\' cried Pippin. \\'O blessed Meriadoc!\\' \\n\\n\\'Which order shall we go in?\\' said Frodo. \\'Eldest first, or quickest \\nfirst? You\\'ll be last either way, Master Peregrin.\\' \\n\\n\\'Trust me to arrange things better than that!\\' said Merry. \\'We can\\'t \\nbegin life at Crickhollow with a quarrel over baths. In that room there are \\nthree tubs, and a copper full of boiling water. There are also towels, mats \\nand soap. Get inside, and be quick!\\' \\n\\nMerry and Fatty went into the kitchen on the other side of the passage, \\nand busied themselves with the final preparations for a late supper. \\nSnatches of competing songs came from the bathroom mixed with the sound \\nof \\n\\nsplashing and wallowing. The voice of Pippin was suddenly lifted up above \\nthe others in one of Bilbo\\'s favourite bath-songs. \\n\\nSing hey! for the bath at close of day \\nthat washes the weary mud away! \\n\\nA loon is he that will not sing: \\n\\nO! Water Hot is a noble thing! \\n\\nO! Sweet is the sound of falling rain, \\nand the brook that leaps from hill to plain; \\nbut better than rain or rippling streams \\nis Water Hot that smokes and steams. \\n\\nO! Water cold we may pour at need \\ndown a thirsty throat and be glad indeed; \\nbut better is Beer, if drink we lack, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand Water Hot poured down the back. \\n\\n\\n\\nO! Water is fair that leaps on high \\n\\nin a fountain white beneath the sky; \\n\\nbut never did fountain sound so sweet \\n\\nas splashing Hot Water with my feet! \\n\\nThere was a terrific splash, and a shout of Whoa! from Frodo. It \\nappeared that a lot of Pippin\\'s bath had imitated a fountain and leaped on \\nhigh. \\n\\nMerry went to the door: \\'What about supper and beer in the throat?\\' he \\ncalled. Frodo came out drying his hair. \\n\\n\\'There\\'s so much water in the air that I\\'m coming into the kitchen to \\nfinish,\\' he said. \\n\\n\\'Lawks!\\' said Merry, looking in. The stone floor was swimming. \\'You \\nought to mop all that up before you get anything to eat. Peregrin,\\' he said. \\n\\'Hurry up, or we shan\\'t wait for you.\\' \\n\\nThey had supper in the kitchen on a table near the fire. \\'I suppose you \\nthree won\\'t want mushrooms again?\\' said Fredegar without much hope. \\n\\n\\'Yes we shall!\\' cried Pippin. \\n\\n\\'They\\'re mine!\\' said Frodo. \\'Given to me by Mrs. Maggot, a queen among \\nfarmers\\' wives. Take your greedy hands away, and I\\'ll serve them.\\' \\n\\nHobbits have a passion for mushrooms, surpassing even the greediest \\nlikings of Big People. A fact which partly explains young Frodo\\'s long \\nexpeditions to the renowned fields of the Marish, and the wrath of the \\ninjured Maggot. On this occasion there was plenty for all, even according to \\nhobbit standards. There were also many other things to follow, and when they \\nhad finished even Fatty Bolger heaved a sigh of content. They pushed back \\nthe table, and drew chairs round the fire. \\n\\n\\'We\\'ll clear up later,\\' said Merry. \\'Now tell me all about it! I guess \\nthat you have been having adventures, which was not quite fair without me. I \\nwant a full account; and most of all I want to know what was the matter with \\nold Maggot, and why he spoke to me like that. He sounded almost as if he was \\nscared, if that is possible.\\' \\n\\n\\'We have all been scared,\\' said Pippin after a pause, in which Frodo \\nstared at the fire and did not speak. \\'You would have been, too, if you had \\nbeen chased for two days by Black Riders.\\' \\n\\n\\'And what are they?\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Black figures riding on black horses,\\' answered Pippin. \\'If Frodo \\nwon\\'t talk, I will tell you the whole tale from the beginning.\\' He then gave \\na full account of their journey from the time when they left Hobbiton. Sam \\ngave various supporting nods and exclamations. Frodo remained silent. \\n\\n\\'I should think you were making it all up,\\' said Merry, \\'if I had not \\nseen that black shape on the landing-stage - and heard the queer sound in \\nMaggot\\'s voice. What do you make of it all, Frodo?\\' \\n\\n\\'Cousin Frodo has been very close,\\' said Pippin. \\'But the time has come \\nfor him to open out. So far we have been given nothing more to go on than \\nFarmer Maggot\\'s guess that it has something to do with old Bilbo\\'s \\ntreasure.\\' \\n\\n\\'That was only a guess,\\' said Frodo hastily. \\'Maggot does not know \\nanything.\\' \\n\\n\\'Old Maggot is a shrewd fellow,\\' said Merry. \\'A lot goes on behind his \\nround face that does not come out in his talk. I\\'ve heard that he used to go \\ninto the Old Forest at one time, and he has the reputation of knowing a good \\nmany strange things. But you can at least tell us, Frodo, whether you think \\nhis guess good or bad.\\' \\n\\n\\'I think, \\' answered Frodo slowly, \\'that it was a good guess, as far as \\nit goes. There is a connexion with Bilbo\\'s old adventures, and the Riders \\nare looking, or perhaps one ought to say searching, for him or for me. I \\nalso fear, if you want to know, that it is no joke at all; and that I am not \\nsafe here or anywhere else.\\' He looked round at the windows and walls, as if \\nhe was afraid they would suddenly give way. The others looked at him in \\nsilence, and exchanged meaning glances among themselves. \\n\\n\\'It\\'s coming out in a minute,\\' whispered Pippin to Merry. Merry nodded. \\n\\n\\'Well!\\' said Frodo at last, sitting up and straightening his back, as \\nif he had made a decision. \\'I can\\'t keep it dark any longer. I have got \\nsomething to tell you all. But I don\\'t know quite how to begin.\\' \\n\\n\\'I think I could help you,\\' said Merry quietly, \\'by telling you some of \\nit myself.\\' \\n\\n\\'What do you mean?\\' said Frodo, looking at him anxiously. \\'Just this, \\nmy dear old Frodo: you are miserable, because you don\\'t know how to say \\ngood-bye. You meant to leave the Shire, of course. But danger has come on \\nyou sooner than you expected, and now you are making up your mind to go at \\nonce. And you don\\'t want to. We are very sorry for you.\\' \\n\\nFrodo opened his mouth and shut it again. His look of surprise was so \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncomical that they laughed. \\'Dear old Frodo!\\' said Pippin. \\'Did you really \\nthink you had thrown dust in all our eyes? You have not been nearly careful \\nor clever enough for that! You have obviously been planning to go and saying \\nfarewell to all your haunts all this year since April. We have constantly \\nheard you muttering: \"Shall I ever look down into that valley again, I \\nwonder\", and things like that. And pretending that you had come to the end \\nof your money, and actually selling your beloved Bag End to those \\nSackville-Bagginses! And all those close talks with Gandalf.\\' \\n\\n\\'Good heavens!\\' said Frodo. \\'I thought I had been both careful and \\nclever. I don\\'t know what Gandalf would say. Is all the Shire discussing my \\ndeparture then?\\' \\n\\n\\'Oh no!\\' said Merry. \\'Don\\'t worry about that! The secret won\\'t keep for \\nlong, of course; but at present it is, I think, only known to us \\nconspirators. After all, you must remember that we know you well, and are \\noften with you. We can usually guess what you are thinking. I knew Bilbo, \\ntoo. To tell you the truth, I had been watching you rather closely ever \\nsince he left. I thought you would go after him sooner or later; indeed I \\nexpected you to go sooner, and lately we have been very anxious. We have \\nbeen terrified that you might give us the slip, and go off suddenly, all on \\nyour own like he did. Ever since this spring we have kept our eyes open, and \\ndone a good deal of planning on our own account. You are not going to escape \\nso easily!\\' \\n\\n\\'But I must go,\\' said Frodo. \\'It cannot be helped, dear friends. It is \\nwretched for us all, but it is no use your trying to keep me. Since you have \\nguessed so much, please help me and do not hinder me!\\' \\n\\n\\'You do not understand!\\' said Pippin. \\'You must go - and therefore we \\nmust, too. Merry and I are coming with you. Sam is an excellent fellow, and \\nwould jump down a dragon\\'s throat to save you, if he did not trip over his \\nown feet; but you will need more than one companion in your dangerous \\nadventure.\\' \\n\\n\\'My dear and most beloved hobbits!\\' said Frodo deeply moved. \\'But I \\ncould not allow it. I decided that long ago, too. You speak of danger, but \\nyou do not understand. This is no treasure-hunt, no there-and -back journey. \\n\\nI am flying from deadly peril into deadly peril.\\' \\n\\n\\'Of course we understand,\\' said Merry firmly. \\'That is why we have \\ndecided to come. We know the Ring is no laughing -matter; but we are going to \\ndo our best to help you against the Enemy.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Ring!\\' said Frodo, now completely amazed. \\n\\n\\'Yes, the Ring,\\' said Merry. \\'My dear old hobbit, you don\\'t allow for \\nthe inquisitiveness of friends. I have known about the existence of the Ring \\nfor years - before Bilbo went away, in fact; but since he obviously regarded \\nit as secret, I kept the knowledge in my head, until we formed our \\nconspiracy. I did not know Bilbo, of course, as well as I know you; I was \\ntoo young, and he was also more careful - but he was not careful enough. If \\nyou want to know how I first found out, I will tell you.\\' \\n\\n\\'Go on!\\' said Frodo faintly. \\n\\n\\'It was the Sackville-Bagginses that were his downfall, as you might \\nexpect. One day, a year before the Party, I happened to be walking along the \\nroad, when I saw Bilbo ahead. Suddenly in the distance the S.-B.s appeared, \\ncoming towards us. Bilbo slowed down, and then hey presto! he vanished. I \\nwas so startled that I hardly had the wits to hide myself in a more ordinary \\nfashion; but I got through the hedge and walked along the field inside. I \\nwas peeping through into the road, after the S.-B.s had passed, and was \\nlooking straight at Bilbo when he suddenly reappeared. I caught a glint of \\ngold as he put something back in his trouser -pocket. \\n\\n\\'After that I kept my eyes open. In fact, I confess that I spied. But \\nyou must admit that it was very intriguing, and I was only in my teens. I \\nmust be the only one in the Shire, besides you Frodo, that has ever seen the \\nold fellow\\'s secret book.\\' \\n\\n\\'You have read his book!\\' cried Frodo. \\'Good heavens above! Is nothing \\nsafe?\\' \\n\\n\\'Not too safe, I should say,\\' said Merry. \\'But I have only had one \\nrapid glance, and that was difficult to get. He never left the book about. I \\nwonder what became of it. I should like another look. Have you got it, \\nFrodo?\\' \\n\\n\\'No. It was not at Bag End. He must have taken it away.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, as I was saying,\\' Merry proceeded, \\'I kept my knowledge to \\nmyself, till this Spring when things got serious. Then we formed our \\nconspiracy; and as we were serious, too, and meant business, we have not \\nbeen too scrupulous. You are not a very easy nut to crack, and Gandalf is \\nworse. But if you want to be introduced to our chief investigator, I can \\nproduce him.\\' \\n\\n\\'Where is he?\\' said Frodo, looking round, as if he expected a masked \\nand sinister figure to come out of a cupboard. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Step forward, Sam!\\' said Merry; and Sam stood up with a face scarlet \\nup to the ears. \\'Here\\'s our collector of information ! And he collected a \\nlot, I can tell you, before he was finally caught. After which, I may say, \\nhe seemed to regard himself as on parole, and dried up.\\' \\n\\n\\'Sam!\\' cried Frodo, feeling that amazement could go no further, and \\nquite unable to decide whether he felt angry, amused, relieved, or merely \\nfoolish. \\n\\n\\'Yes, sir!\\' said Sam. \\'Begging your pardon, sir! But I meant no wrong \\nto you, Mr. Frodo, nor to Mr. Gandalf for that matter. He has some sense, \\nmind you; and when you said go alone, he said no! lake someone as you can \\ntrust. \\' \\n\\n\\'But it does not seem that I can trust anyone,\\' said Frodo. Sam looked \\nat him unhappily. \\'It all depends on what you want,\\' put in Merry. \\'You can \\ntrust us to stick to you through thick and thin - to the bitter end. And you \\ncan trust us to keep any secret of yours - closer than you keep it yourself. \\n\\nBut you cannot trust us to let you face trouble alone, and go off without a \\nword. We are your friends, Frodo. Anyway: there it is. We know most of what \\nGandalf has told you. We know a good deal about the Ring. We are horribly \\nafraid - but we are coming with you; or following you like hounds.\\' \\n\\n\\'And after all, sir,\\' added Sam, \\'you did ought to take the Elves\\' \\nadvice. Gildor said you should take them as was willing, and you can\\'t deny \\nit.\\' \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t deny it,\\' said Frodo, looking at Sam, who was now grinning. \\'I \\ndon\\'t deny it, but I\\'ll never believe you are sleeping again, whether you \\nsnore or not. I shall kick you hard to make sure. \\n\\n\\'You are a set of deceitful scoundrels!\\' he said, turning to the \\nothers. \\'But bless you!\\' he laughed, getting up and waving his arms, \\'I give \\nin. I will take Gildor\\'s advice. If the danger were not so dark, I should \\ndance for joy. Even so, I cannot help feeling happy; happier than I have \\nfelt for a long time. I had dreaded this evening.\\' \\n\\n\\'Good! That\\'s settled. Three cheers for Captain Frodo and company!\\' \\nthey shouted; and they danced round him. Merry and Pippin began a song, \\nwhich they had apparently got ready for the occasion. \\n\\nIt was made on the model of the dwarf-song that started Bilbo on his \\nadventure long ago, and went to the same tune: \\n\\nFarewell we call to hearth and hall! \\n\\nThough wind may blow and rain may fall, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe must away ere break of day \\nFar over wood and mountain tall. \\n\\n\\n\\nTo Rivendell, where Elves yet dwell \\nIn glades beneath the misty fell, \\n\\nThrough moor and waste we ride in haste, \\n\\nAnd whither then we cannot tell. \\n\\nWith foes ahead, behind us dread, \\n\\nBeneath the sky shall be our bed, \\n\\nUntil at last our toil be passed, \\n\\nOur journey done, our errand sped. \\n\\nWe must away! We must away! \\n\\nWe ride before the break of day! \\n\\n\\'Very good!\\' said Frodo. \\'But in that case there are a lot of things to \\ndo before we go to bed - under a roof, for tonight at any rate.\\' \\n\\n\\'Oh! That was poetry!\\' said Pippin. \\'Do you really mean to start before \\nthe break of day?\\' \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know,\\' answered Frodo. \\'I fear those Black Riders, and I am \\nsure it is unsafe to stay in one place long, especially in a place to which \\nit is known I was going. Also Gildor advised me not to wait. But I should \\nvery much like to see Gandalf. I could see that even Gildor was disturbed \\nwhen he heard that Gandalf had never appeared. It really depends on two \\nthings. Flow soon could the Riders get to Bucklebury? And how soon could \\nwe \\n\\nget off? It will take a good deal of preparation.\\' \\n\\n\\'The answer to the second question,\\' said Merry, \\'is that we could get \\noff in an hour. I have prepared practically everything. There are six ponies \\nin a stable across the fields; stores and tackle are all packed, except for \\na few extra clothes, and the perishable food.\\' \\n\\n\\'It seems to have been a very efficient conspiracy,\\' said Frodo. \\'But \\nwhat about the Black Riders? Would it be safe to wait one day for Gandalf?\\' \\n\\n\\'That all depends on what you think the Riders would do, if they found \\nyou here,\\' answered Merry. \\'They could have reached here by now, of course, \\nif they were not stopped at the North-gate, where the Hedge runs down to the \\nriver -bank, just this side of the Bridge. The gate-guards would not let them \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthrough by night, though they might break through. Even in the daylight they \\nwould try to keep them out, I think, at any rate until they got a message \\nthrough to the Master of the Hall - for they would not like the look of the \\nRiders, and would certainly be frightened by them. But, of course, Buckland \\ncannot resist a determined attack for long. And it is possible that in the \\nmorning even a Black Rider that rode up and asked for Mr. Baggins would be \\nlet through. It is pretty generally known that you are coming back to live \\nat Crickhollow.\\' \\n\\nFrodo sat for a while in thought. \\'I have made up my mind,\\' he said \\nfinally. \\'I am starting tomorrow, as soon as it is light. But I am not going \\nby road: it would be safer to wait here than that. If I go through the \\nNorth-gate my departure from Buckland will be known at once, instead of \\nbeing secret for several days at least, as it might be. And what is more, \\nthe Bridge and the East Road near the borders will certainly be watched, \\nwhether any Rider gets into Buckland or not. We don\\'t know how many there \\nare; but there are at least two, and possibly more. The only thing to do is \\nto go off in a quite unexpected direction.\\' \\n\\n\\'But that can only mean going into the Old Forest!\\' said Fredegar \\nhorrified. \\'You can\\'t be thinking of doing that. It is quite as dangerous as \\nBlack Riders.\\' \\n\\n\\'Not quite,\\' said Merry. It sounds very desperate, but I believe Frodo \\nis right. It is the only way of getting off without being followed at once. \\n\\nWith luck we might gel a considerable start.\\' \\n\\n\\'But you won\\'t have any luck in the Old Forest,\\' objected Fredegar. \\'No \\none ever has luck in there. You\\'ll gel lost. People don\\'t go in there.\\' \\n\\n\\'Oh yes they do!\\' said Merry. \\'The Brandybucks go in - occasionally \\nwhen the fit takes them. We have a private entrance. Frodo went in once, \\nlong ago. I have been in several times: usually in daylight, of course, when \\nthe trees are sleepy and fairly quiet.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, do as you think best!\\' said Fredegar. \\'I am more afraid of the \\nOld Forest than of anything I know about: the stories about it are a \\nnightmare; but my vote hardly counts, as I am not going on the journey. \\n\\nStill, I am very glad someone is stopping behind, who can tell Gandalf what \\nyou have done, when he turns up, as I am sure he will before long.\\' \\n\\nFond as he was of Frodo, Fatty Bolger had no desire to leave the Shire, \\nnor to see what lay outside it. His family came from the Eastfarthing, from \\nBudgeford in Bridgefields in fact, but he had never been over the Brandywine \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBridge. His task, according to the original plans of the conspirators, was \\nto stay behind and deal with inquisitive folk, and to keep up as long as \\npossible the pretence that Mr. Baggins was still living at Crickhollow. He \\nhad even brought along some old clothes of Frodo\\'s to help him in playing \\nthe part. They little thought how dangerous that part might prove. \\n\\n\\'Excellent!\\' said Frodo, when he understood the plan. \\'We could not \\nhave left any message behind for Gandalf otherwise. I don\\'t know whether \\nthese Riders can read or not, of course, but I should not have dared to risk \\na written message, in case they got in and searched the house. But if Fatty \\nis willing to hold the fort, and I can be sure of Gandalf knowing the way we \\nhave gone, that decides me. I am going into the Old Forest first thing \\ntomorrow.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, that\\'s that,\\' said Pippin. \\'On the whole I would rather have our \\njob than Fatty\\'s - waiting here till Black Riders come.\\' \\n\\n\\'You wait till you are well inside the Forest,\\' said Fredegar. \\'You\\'ll \\nwish you were back here with me before this time tomorrow.\\' \\n\\n\\'It\\'s no good arguing about it any more,\\' said Merry. \\'We have still \\ngot to tidy up and put the finishing touches to the packing, before we get \\nto bed. I shall call you all before the break of day.\\' \\n\\nWhen at last he had got to bed, Frodo could not sleep for some time. \\n\\nHis legs ached. He. was glad that he was riding in the morning. Eventually \\nhe fell into a vague dream, in which he seemed to be looking out of a high \\nwindow over a dark sea of tangled trees. Down below among the roots there \\nwas the sound of creatures crawling and snuffling. He felt sure they would \\nsmell him out sooner or later. \\n\\nThen he heard a noise in the distance. At first he thought it was a \\ngreat wind coming over the leaves of the forest. Then he knew that it was \\nnot leaves, but the sound of the Sea far-off; a sound he had never heard in \\nwaking life, though it had often troubled his dreams. Suddenly he found he \\nwas out in the open. There were no trees after all. He was on a dark heath, \\nand there was a strange salt smell in the air. Looking up he saw before him \\na tall white tower, standing alone on a high ridge. A great desire came over \\nhim to climb the tower and see the Sea. He started to struggle up the ridge \\ntowards the tower: but suddenly a light came in the sky, and there was a \\nnoise of thunder. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 6. The Old Forest \\n\\n\\n\\nFrodo woke suddenly. It was still dark in the room. Merry was standing \\nthere with a candle in one hand, and banging on the door with the other. \\n\\n\\'All right! What is it?\\' said Frodo, still shaken and bewildered. \\n\\n\\'What is it!\\' cried Merry. \\'It is time to get up. It is half past four \\nand very foggy. Come on! Sam is already getting breakfast ready. Even Pippin \\nis up. I am just going to saddle the ponies, and fetch the one that is to be \\nthe baggage-carrier. Wake that sluggard Fatty! At least he must get up and \\nsee us off.\\' \\n\\nSoon after six o\\'clock the five hobbits were ready to start. Fatty \\nBolger was still yawning. They stole quietly out of the house. Merry went in \\nfront leading a laden pony, and took his way along a path that went through \\na spinney behind the house, and then cut across several fields. The leaves \\nof trees were glistening, and every twig was dripping; the grass was grey \\nwith cold dew. Everything was still, and far-away noises seemed near and \\nclear: fowls chattering in a yard, someone closing a door of a distant \\nhouse. \\n\\nIn their shed they found the ponies; sturdy little beasts of the kind \\nloved by hobbits, not speedy, but good for a long day\\'s work. They mounted, \\nand soon they were riding off into the mist, which seemed to open \\nreluctantly before them and close forbiddingly behind them. After riding for \\nabout an hour, slowly and without talking, they saw the Fledge looming \\nsuddenly ahead. It was tall and netted over with silver cobwebs. \\'How are \\nyou going to get through this?\\' asked Fredegar. \\'Follow me!\\' said Merry, \\n\\n\\'and you will see.\\' He turned to the left along the Hedge, and soon they \\ncame to a point where it bent inwards, running along the lip of a hollow. A \\ncutting had been made, at some distance from the Hedge, and went sloping \\ngently down into the ground. It had walls of brick at the sides, which rose \\nsteadily, until suddenly they arched over and formed a tunnel that dived \\ndeep under the Hedge and came out in the hollow on the other side. \\n\\nHere Fatty Bolger halted. \\'Good-bye, Frodo!\\' he said. \\'I wish you were \\nnot going into the Forest. I only hope you will not need rescuing before the \\nday is out. But good luck to you - today and every day!\\' \\n\\n\\'If there are no worse things ahead than the Old Forest, I shall be \\nlucky,\\' said Frodo. \\'Tell Gandalf to hurry along the East Road: we shall \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsoon be back on it and going as fast as we can.\\' \\'Good-bye!\\' they cried, and \\nrode down the slope and disappeared from Fredegar\\'s sight into the tunnel. \\n\\nIt was dark and damp. At the far end it was closed by a gate of \\nthick-set iron bars. Merry got down and unlocked the gate, and when they had \\nall passed through he pushed it to again. It shut with a clang, and the lock \\nclicked. The sound was ominous. \\n\\n\\'There!\\' said Merry. \\'You have left the Shire, and are now outside, and \\non the edge of the Old Forest.\\' \\n\\n\\'Are the stories about it true?\\' asked Pippin. \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know what stories you mean,\\' Merry answered. \\'If you mean the \\nold bogey-stories Fatty\\'s nurses used to tell him, about goblins and wolves \\nand things of that sort, I should say no. At any rate I don\\'t believe them. \\n\\nBut the Forest is queer. Everything in it is very much more alive, more \\naware of what is going on, so to speak, than things are in the Shire. And \\nthe trees do not like strangers. They watch you. They are usually content \\nmerely to watch you, as long as daylight lasts, and don\\'t do much. \\nOccasionally the most unfriendly ones may drop a branch, or stick a root \\nout, or grasp at you with a long trailer. But at night things can be most \\nalarming, or so I am told. I have only once or twice been in here after \\ndark, and then only near the hedge. I thought all the trees were whispering \\nto each other, passing news and plots along in an unintelligible language; \\nand the branches swayed and groped without any wind. They do say the trees \\ndo actually move, and can surround strangers and hem them in. In fact long \\nago they attacked the Hedge: they came and planted themselves right by it, \\nand leaned over it. But the hobbits came and cut down hundreds of trees, and \\nmade a great bonfire in the Forest, and burned all the ground in a long \\nstrip east of the Hedge. After that the trees gave up the attack, but they \\nbecame very unfriendly. There is still a wide bare space not far inside \\nwhere the bonfire was made.\\' \\n\\n\\'Is it only the trees that are dangerous?\\' asked Pippin. \\n\\n\\'There are various queer things living deep in the Forest, and on the \\nfar side,\\' said Merry, \\'or at least I have heard so; but I have never seen \\nany of them. But something makes paths. Whenever one comes inside one \\nfinds \\n\\nopen tracks; but they seem to shift and change from time to time in a queer \\nfashion. Not far from this tunnel there is, or was for a long time, the \\nbeginning of quite a broad path leading to the Bonfire Glade, and then on \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmore or less in our direction, east and a little north. That is the path I \\nam going to try and find.\\' \\n\\nThe hobbits now left the tunnel-gate and rode across the wide hollow. \\n\\nOn the far side was a faint path leading up on to the floor of the Forest, a \\nhundred yards and more beyond the Hedge; but it vanished as soon as it \\nbrought them under the trees. Looking back they could see the dark line of \\nthe Hedge through the stems of trees that were already thick about them. \\nLooking ahead they could see only tree-trunks of innumerable sizes and \\nshapes: straight or bent, twisted, leaning, squat or slender, smooth or \\ngnarled and branched; and all the stems were green or grey with moss and \\nslimy, shaggy growths. \\n\\nMerry alone seemed fairly cheerful. \\'You had better lead on and find \\nthat path,\\' Frodo said to him. \\'Don\\'t let us lose one another, or forget \\nwhich way the Hedge lies!\\' \\n\\nThey picked a way among the trees, and their ponies plodded along, \\ncarefully avoiding the many writhing and interlacing roots. There was no \\nundergrowth. The ground was rising steadily, and as they went forward it \\nseemed that the trees became taller, darker, and thicker. There was no \\nsound, except an occasional drip of moisture falling through the still \\nleaves. For the moment there was no whispering or movement among the \\nbranches; but they all got an uncomfortable feeling that they were being \\nwatched with disapproval, deepening to dislike and even enmity. The feeling \\nsteadily grew, until they found themselves looking up quickly, or glancing \\nback over their shoulders, as if they expected a sudden blow. \\n\\nThere was not as yet any sign of a path, and the trees seemed \\nconstantly to bar their way. Pippin suddenly felt that he could not bear it \\nany longer, and without warning let out a shout. \\'Oi! Oi !\\' he cried. \\'I am \\nnot going to do anything. Just let me pass through, will you!\\' \\n\\nThe others halted startled; but the cry fell as if muffled by a heavy \\ncurtain. There was no echo or answer though the wood seemed to become \\nmore \\n\\ncrowded and more watchful than before. \\n\\n\\'I should not shout, if I were you,\\' said Merry. It does more harm than \\ngood.\\' \\n\\nFrodo began to wonder if it were possible to find a way through, and if \\nhe had been right to make the others come into this abominable wood. Merry \\nwas looking from side to side, and seemed already uncertain which way to go. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPippin noticed it. \\'It has not taken you long to lose us,\\' he said. But at \\nthat moment Merry gave a whistle of relief and pointed ahead. \\n\\n\\'Well, well!\\' he said. \\'These trees do shift. There is the Bonfire \\nGlade in front of us (or I hope so), but the path to it seems to have moved \\naway!\\' \\n\\nThe light grew clearer as they went forward. Suddenly they came out of \\nthe trees and found themselves in a wide circular space. There was sky above \\nthem, blue and clear to their surprise, for down under the Forest -roof they \\nhad not been able to see the rising morning and the lifting of the mist. The \\nsun was not, however, high enough yet to shine down into the clearing, \\nthough its light was on the tree-tops. The leaves were all thicker and \\ngreener about the edges of the glade, enclosing it with an almost solid \\nwall. No tree grew there, only rough grass and many tall plants: stalky and \\nfaded hemlocks and wood-parsley, fire-weed seeding into fluffy ashes, and \\nrampant nettles and thistles. A dreary place: but it seemed a charming and \\ncheerful garden after the close Forest. \\n\\nThe hobbits felt encouraged, and looked up hopefully at the broadening \\ndaylight in the sky. At the far side of the glade there was a break in the \\nwall of trees, and a clear path beyond it. They could see it running on into \\nthe wood, wide in places and open above, though every now and again the \\ntrees drew in and overshadowed it with their dark boughs. Up this path they \\nrode. They were still climbing gently, but they now went much quicker, and \\nwith better heart; for it seemed to them that the Forest had relented, and \\nwas going to let them pass unhindered after all. \\n\\nBut after a while the air began to get hot and stuffy. The trees drew \\nclose again on either side, and they could no longer see far ahead. Now \\nstronger than ever they felt again the ill will of the wood pressing on \\nthem. So silent was it that the fall of their ponies\\' hoofs, rustling on \\ndead leaves and occasionally stumbling on hidden roots, seemed to thud in \\ntheir ears. Frodo tried to sing a song to encourage them, but his voice sank \\nto a murmur. \\n\\nO! Wanderers in the shadowed land \\ndespair not! For though dark they stand, \\nall woods there be must end at last, \\nand see the open sun go past: \\nthe setting sun, the rising sun, \\nthe day\\'s end, or the day begun. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor east or west all woods must fail... \\n\\nFail - even as he said the word his voice faded into silence. The air \\nseemed heavy and the making of words wearisome. Just behind them a large \\nbranch fell from an old overhanging tree with a crash into the path. The \\ntrees seemed to close in before them. \\n\\nThey do not like all that about ending and failing,\\' said Merry. \\'I \\nshould not sing any more at present. Wait till we do get to the edge, and \\nthen we\\'ll turn and give them a rousing chorus!\\' \\n\\nHe spoke cheerfully, and if he felt any great anxiety, he did not show \\nit. The others did not answer. They were depressed. A heavy weight was \\nsettling steadily on Frodo\\'s heart, and he regretted now with every step \\nforward that he had ever thought of challenging the menace of the trees. He \\nwas, indeed, just about to stop and propose going back (if that was still \\npossible), when things took a new turn. The path stopped climbing, and \\nbecame for a while nearly level. The dark trees drew aside, and ahead they \\ncould see the path going almost straight forward. Before them, but some \\ndistance off, there stood a green hill-top, treeless, rising like a bald \\nhead out of the encircling wood. The path seemed to be making directly for \\nit. \\n\\nThey now hurried forward again, delighted with the thought of climbing \\nout for a while above the roof of the Forest. The path dipped, and then \\nagain began to climb upwards, leading them at last to the foot of the steep \\nhillside. There it left the trees and faded into the turf. The wood stood \\nall round the hill like thick hair that ended sharply in a circle round a \\nshaven crown. \\n\\nThe hobbits led their ponies up, winding round and round until they \\nreached the top. There they stood and gazed about them. The air was gleaming \\nand sunlit, but hazy; and they could not see to any great distance. Near at \\nhand the mist was now almost gone; though here and there it lay in hollows \\nof the wood, and to the south of them, out of a deep fold cutting right \\nacross the Forest, the fog still rose like steam or wisps of white smoke. \\n\\n\\'That,\\' said Merry, pointing with his hand, \\'that is the line of the \\nWithywindle. It comes down out of the Downs and flows south-west through \\nthe \\n\\nmidst of the Forest to join the Brandywine below Haysend. We don\\'t want to \\ngo that way! The Withywindle valley is said to be the queerest part of the \\nwhole wood - the centre from which all the queerness comes, as it were.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe others looked in the direction that Merry pointed out, but they \\ncould see little but mists over the damp and deep-cut valley; and beyond it \\nthe southern half of the Forest faded from view. \\n\\nThe sun on the hill-lop was now getting hot. It must have been about \\neleven o\\'clock; but the autumn haze still prevented them from seeing much in \\nother directions. In the west they could not make out either the line of the \\nHedge or the valley of the Brandywine beyond it. Northward, where they \\nlooked most hopefully, they could see nothing that might be the line of the \\ngreat East Road, for which they were making. They were on an island in a sea \\nof trees, and the horizon was veiled. \\n\\nOn the south-eastern side the ground fell very steeply, as if the \\nslopes of the hill were continued far down under the trees, like \\nisland-shores that really are the sides of a mountain rising out of deep \\nwaters. They sat on the green edge and looked out over the woods below them, \\nwhile they ate their mid-day meal. As the sun rose and passed noon they \\nglimpsed far off in the east the grey-green lines of the Downs that lay \\nbeyond the Old Forest on that side. That cheered them greatly; for it was \\ngood to see a sight of anything beyond the wood\\'s borders, though they did \\nnot mean to go that way, if they could help it: the Barrow-downs had as \\nsinister a reputation in hobbit-legend as the Forest itself. \\n\\nAt length they made up their minds to go on again. The path that had \\nbrought them to the hill reappeared on the northward side; but they had not \\nfollowed it far before they became aware that it was bending steadily to the \\nright. Soon it began to descend rapidly and they guessed that it must \\nactually be heading towards the Withy windle valley: not at all the direction \\nthey wished lo take. After some discussion they decided to leave this \\nmisleading path and strike northward; for although they had not been able to \\nsee it from the hill-top, the Road must lie that way, and it could not be \\nmany miles off. Also northward, and to the left of the path, the land seemed \\nlo be drier and more open, climbing up to slopes where the trees were \\nthinner, and pines and firs replaced the oaks and ashes and other strange \\nand nameless trees of the denser wood. \\n\\nAt first their choice seemed to be good: they got along at a fair \\nspeed, though whenever they got a glimpse of the sun in an open glade they \\nseemed unaccountably to have veered eastwards. But after a time the trees \\nbegan to close in again, just where they had appeared from a distance to be \\nthinner and less tangled. Then deep folds in the ground were discovered \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nunexpectedly, like the ruts of great giant-wheels or wide moats and sunken \\nroads long disused and choked with brambles. These lay usually right across \\ntheir line of march, and could only be crossed by scrambling down and out \\nagain, which was troublesome and difficult with their ponies. Each time they \\nclimbed down they found the hollow filled with thick bushes and matted \\nundergrowth, which somehow would not yield to the left, but only gave way \\nwhen they turned to the right; and they had to go some distance along the \\nbottom before they could find a way up the further bank. Each time they \\nclambered out, the trees seemed deeper and darker; and always to the left \\nand upwards it was most difficult to find a way, and they were forced to the \\nright and downwards. \\n\\nAfter an hour or two they had lost all clear sense of direction, though \\nthey knew well enough that they had long ceased to go northward at all. They \\nwere being headed off, and were simply following a course chosen for them - \\neastwards and southwards, into the heart of the Forest and not out of it. \\n\\nThe afternoon was wearing away when they scrambled and stumbled into a \\nfold that was wider and deeper than any they had yet met. It was so sleep \\nand overhung that it proved impossible to climb out of it again, either \\nforwards or backwards, without leaving their ponies and their baggage \\nbehind. All they could do was to follow the fold - downwards. The ground \\ngrew soft, and in places boggy; springs appeared in the banks, and soon they \\nfound themselves following a brook that trickled and babbled through a weedy \\nbed. Then the ground began to fall rapidly, and the brook growing strong and \\nnoisy, flowed and leaped swiftly downhill. They were in a deep dim-lit gully \\nover-arched by trees high above them. \\n\\nAfter stumbling along for some way along the stream, they came quite \\nsuddenly out of the gloom. As if through a gate they saw the sunlight before \\nthem. Coming to the opening they found that they had made their way down \\nthrough a cleft in a high sleep bank, almost a cliff. At its feet was a wide \\nspace of grass and reeds; and in the distance could be glimpsed another bank \\nalmost as steep. A golden afternoon of late sunshine lay warm and drowsy \\nupon the hidden land between. In the midst of it there wound lazily a dark \\nriver of brown water, bordered with ancient willows, arched over with \\nwillows, blocked with fallen willows, and flecked with thousands of faded \\nwillow-leaves. The air was thick with them, fluttering yellow from the \\nbranches; for there was a warm and gentle breeze blowing softly in the \\nvalley, and the reeds were rustling, and the willow-boughs were creaking. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Well, now I have at least some notion of where we are!\\' said Merry. \\n\\n\\'We have come almost in the opposite direction to which we intended. This is \\nthe River Withy windle! I will go on and explore.\\' \\n\\nHe passed out into the sunshine and disappeared into the long grasses. \\nAfter a while he reappeared, and reported that there was fairly solid ground \\nbetween the cliff-foot and the river; in some places firm turf went down to \\nthe water\\'s edge. \\'What\\'s more,\\' he said, \\'there seems to be something like \\na footpath winding along on this side of the river. If we turn left and \\nfollow it, we shall be bound to come out on the east side of the Forest \\neventually.\\' \\n\\n\\'I dare say!\\' said Pippin. \\'That is, if the track goes on so far, and \\ndoes not simply lead us into a bog and leave us there. Who made the track, \\ndo you suppose, and why? I am sure it was not for our benefit. I am getting \\nvery suspicious of this Forest and everything in it, and I begin to believe \\nall the stories about it. And have you any idea how far eastward we should \\nhave to go?\\' \\n\\n\\'No,\\' said Merry, \\'I haven\\'t. I don\\'t know in the least how far down \\nthe Withywindle we are, or who could possibly come here often enough to \\nmake \\n\\na path along it. But there is no other way out that I can see or think of.\\' \\n\\nThere being nothing else for it, they filed out, and Merry led them to \\nthe path that he had discovered. Everywhere the reeds and grasses were lush \\nand tall, in places far above their heads; but once found, the path was easy \\nto follow, as it turned and twisted, picking out the sounder ground among \\nthe bogs and pools. Here and there it passed over other rills, running down \\ngullies into the Withywindle out of the higher forest-lands, and at these \\npoints there were tree-trunks or bundles of brushwood laid carefully across. \\n\\nThe hobbits began to feel very hot. There were armies of flies of all \\nkinds buzzing round their ears, and the afternoon sun was burning on their \\nbacks. At last they came suddenly into a thin shade; great grey branches \\nreached across the path. Each step forward became more reluctant than the \\nlast. Sleepiness seemed to be creeping out of the ground and up their legs, \\nand falling softly out of the air upon their heads and eyes. \\n\\nFrodo felt his chin go down and his head nod. Just in front of him \\nPippin fell forward on to his knees. Frodo halted. \\'It\\'s no good,\\' he heard \\nMerry saying. \\'Can\\'t go another step without rest. Must have nap. It\\'s cool \\nunder the willows. Less flies!\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrodo did not like the sound of this. \\'Come on!\\' he cried. \\'We can\\'t \\nhave a nap yet. We must get clear of the Forest first.\\' But the others were \\ntoo far gone to care. Beside them Sam stood yawning and blinking stupidly. \\n\\nSuddenly Frodo himself felt sleep overwhelming him. His head swam. \\nThere now seemed hardly a sound in the air. The flies had stopped buzzing. \\nOnly a gentle noise on the edge of hearing, a soft fluttering as of a song \\nhalf whispered, seemed to stir in the boughs above. He lifted his heavy eyes \\nand saw leaning over him a huge willow-tree, old and hoary. Enormous it \\nlooked, its sprawling branches going up like reaching arms with many \\nlong-fingered hands, its knotted and twisted trunk gaping in wide fissures \\nthat creaked faintly as the boughs moved. The leaves fluttering against the \\nbright sky dazzled him, and he toppled over, lying where he fell upon the \\ngrass. \\n\\nMerry and Pippin dragged themselves forward and lay down with their \\nbacks to the willow-trunk. Behind them the great cracks gaped wide to \\nreceive them as the tree swayed and creaked. They looked up at the grey and \\nyellow leaves, moving softly against the light, and singing. They shut their \\neyes, and then it seemed that they could almost hear words, cool words, \\nsaying something about water and sleep. They gave themselves up to the spell \\nand fell fast asleep at the foot of the great grey willow. \\n\\nFrodo lay for a while fighting with the sleep that was overpowering \\nhim; then with an effort he struggled to his feel again. He felt a \\ncompelling desire for cool water. \\'Wait for me, Sam,\\' he stammered. \\'Must \\nbathe feet a minute.\\' \\n\\nHalf in a dream he wandered forward to the riverward side of the tree, \\nwhere great winding roots grew out into the stream, like gnarled dragonets \\nstraining down to drink. He straddled one of these, and paddled his hot feel \\nin the cool brown water; and there he too suddenly fell asleep with his back \\nagainst the tree. \\n\\nSam sat down and scratched his head, and yawned like a cavern. He was \\nworried. The afternoon was getting late, and he thought this sudden \\nsleepiness uncanny. \\'There\\'s more behind this than sun and warm air,\\' he \\nmuttered to himself. \\'I don\\'t like this great big tree. I don\\'t trust it. \\n\\nHark at it singing about sleep now! This won\\'t do at all!\\' \\n\\nHe pulled himself to his feet, and staggered off to see what had become \\nof the ponies. He found that two had wandered on a good way along the path; \\nand he had just caught them and brought them back towards the others, when \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhe heard two noises; one loud, and the other soft but very clear. One was \\nthe splash of something heavy falling into the water; the other was a noise \\nlike the snick of a lock when a door quietly closes fast. \\n\\nHe rushed back to the bank. Frodo was in the water close to the edge, \\nand a great tree-root seemed to be over him and holding him down, but he was \\nnot struggling. Sam gripped him by the jacket, and dragged him from under \\nthe root; and then with difficulty hauled him on to the bank. Almost at once \\nhe woke, and coughed and spluttered. \\n\\n\\'Do you know, Sam,\\' he said at length, \\'the beastly tree threw me in! I \\nfelt it. The big root just twisted round and tipped me in!\\' \\n\\n\\'You were dreaming I expect, Mr. Frodo,\\' said Sam. \\'You shouldn\\'t sit \\nin such a place, if you feel sleepy.\\' \\n\\n\\'What about the others?\\' Frodo asked. \\'I wonder what sort of dreams \\nthey are having.\\' \\n\\nThey went round to the other side of the tree, and then Sam understood \\nthe click that he had heard. Pippin had vanished. The crack by which he had \\nlaid himself had closed together, so that not a chink could be seen. Merry \\nwas trapped: another crack had closed about his waist; his legs lay outside, \\nbut the rest of him was inside a dark opening, the edges of which gripped \\nlike a pair of pincers. \\n\\nFrodo and Sam beat first upon the tree-trunk where Pippin had lain. \\n\\nThey then struggled frantically to pull open the jaws of the crack that held \\npoor Merry. It was quite useless. \\n\\n\\'What a foul thing to happen!\\' cried Frodo wildly. \\'Why did we ever \\ncome into this dreadful Forest? I wish we were all back at Crickhollow!\\' He \\nkicked the tree with all his strength, heedless of his own feet. A hardly \\nperceptible shiver ran through the stem and up into the branches; the leaves \\nrustled and whispered, but with a sound now of faint and far-off laughter. \\n\\n\\'I suppose we haven\\'t got an axe among our luggage, Mr. Frodo?\\' asked \\nSam. \\n\\n\\'I brought a little hatchet for chopping firewood,\\' said Frodo. \\'That \\nwouldn\\'t be much use.\\' \\n\\n\\'Wait a minute!\\' cried Sam, struck by an idea suggested by firewood. \\n\\n\\'We might do something with fire!\\' \\n\\n\\'We might,\\' said Frodo doubtfully. \\'We might succeed in roasting Pippin \\nalive inside.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'We might try to hurt or frighten this tree to begin with,\\' said Sam \\nfiercely. \\'If it don\\'t let them go, I\\'ll have it down, if I have to gnaw \\nit.\\' He ran to the ponies and before long came back with two tinder-boxes \\nand a hatchet. \\n\\nQuickly they gathered dry grass and leaves, and bits of bark; and made \\na pile of broken twigs and chopped sticks. These they heaped against the \\ntrunk on the far side of the tree from the prisoners. As soon as Sam had \\nstruck a spark into the tinder, it kindled the dry grass and a flurry of \\nflame and smoke went up. The twigs crackled. Little fingers of fire licked \\nagainst the dry scored rind of the ancient tree and scorched it. A tremor \\nran through the whole willow. The leaves seemed to hiss above their heads \\nwith a sound of pain and anger. A loud scream came from Merry, and from far \\ninside the tree they heard Pippin give a muffled yell. \\n\\n\\'Put it out! Put it out!\\' cried Merry. \\'He\\'ll squeeze me in two, if you \\ndon\\'t. He says so!\\' \\n\\n\\'Who? What?\\' shouted Frodo, rushing round to the other side of the \\ntree. \\n\\n\\'Put it out! Put it out!\\' begged Merry. The branches of the willow \\nbegan to sway violently. There was a sound as of a wind rising and spreading \\noutwards to the branches of all the other trees round about, as though they \\nhad dropped a stone into the quiet slumber of the river -valley and set up \\nripples of anger that ran out over the whole Forest. Sam kicked at the \\nlittle fire and stamped out the sparks. But Frodo, without any clear idea of \\nwhy he did so, or what he hoped for, ran along the path crying help! help! \\nhelp! It seemed to him that he could hardly hear the sound of his own shrill \\nvoice: it was blown away from him by the willow-wind and drowned in a \\nclamour of leaves, as soon as the words left his mouth. He felt desperate: \\nlost and witless. \\n\\nSuddenly he slopped. There was an answer, or so he thought; but it \\nseemed to come from behind him, away down the path further back in the \\nForest. He turned round and listened, and soon there could be no doubt: \\nsomeone was singing a song; a deep glad voice was singing carelessly and \\nhappily, but it was singing nonsense: \\n\\nHey dol! merry dol! ring a dong dillo! \\n\\nRing a dong! hop along! fal lal the willow! \\n\\nTom Bom, jolly Tom, Tom Bombadillo! \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHalf hopeful and half afraid of some new danger, Frodo and Sam now both \\nstood still. Suddenly out of a long string of nonsense-words (or so they \\nseemed) the voice rose up loud and clear and burst into this song: \\n\\nHey! Come merry dot ! derry dol! My darling! \\n\\nLight goes the weather-wind and the feathered starling. \\n\\nDown along under Hill, shining in the sunlight, \\n\\nWaiting on the doorstep for the cold starlight, \\n\\nThere my pretty lady is. River-woman\\'s daughter, \\n\\nSlender as the willow-wand, clearer than the water. \\n\\nOld Tom Bombadil water-lilies bringing \\n\\nComes hopping home again. Can you hear him singing? \\n\\nHey! Come merry dol! deny dol! and merry-o, \\n\\nGoldberry, Goldberry, merry yellow berry-o! \\n\\nPoor old Willow-man, you tuck your roots away! \\n\\nTom\\'s in a hurry now. Evening will follow day. \\n\\nTom\\'s going home again water-lilies bringing. \\n\\nHey! Come derry dol! Can you hear me singing? \\n\\nFrodo and Sam stood as if enchanted. The wind puffed out. The leaves \\nhung silently again on stiff branches. There was another burst of song, and \\nthen suddenly, hopping and dancing along the path, there appeared above the \\nreeds an old battered hat with a tall crown and a long blue feather stuck in \\nthe band. With another hop and a bound there came into view a man, or so it \\nseemed. At any rate he was too large and heavy for a hobbit, if not quite \\ntall enough for one of the Big People, though he made noise enough for one, \\nslumping along with great yellow boots on his thick legs, and charging \\nthrough grass and rushes like a cow going down to drink. He had a blue coat \\nand a long brown beard; his eyes were blue and bright, and his face was red \\nas a ripe apple, but creased into a hundred wrinkles of laughter. In his \\nhands he carried on a large leaf as on a tray a small pile of white \\nwater-lilies. \\n\\n\\'Help!\\' cried Frodo and Sam running towards him with their hands \\nstretched out. \\n\\n\\'Whoa! Whoa! steady there!\\' cried the old man, holding up one hand, and \\nthey stopped short, as if they had been struck stiff. \\'Now, my little \\nfellows, where be you a-going to, puffing like a bellows? What\\'s the matter \\nhere then? Do you know who I am? I\\'m Tom Bombadil. Tell me what\\'s \\nyour \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntrouble! Tom\\'s in a hurry now. Don\\'t you crush my lilies!\\' \\n\\n\\'My friends are caught in the willow-tree,\\' cried Frodo breathlessly. \\n\\n\\'Master Merry\\'s being squeezed in a crack!\\' cried Sam. \\n\\n\\'What?\\' shouted Tom Bombadil, leaping up in the air. \\'Old Man Willow? \\nNaught worse than that, eh? That can soon be mended. I know the tune for \\nhim. Old grey Willow-man! I\\'ll freeze his marrow cold, if he don\\'t behave \\nhimself. I\\'ll sing his roots off. I\\'ll sing a wind up and blow leaf and \\nbranch away. Old Man Willow!\\' Setting down his lilies carefully on the \\ngrass, he ran to the tree. There he saw Merry\\'s feet still sticking out - \\nthe rest had already been drawn further inside. Tom put his mouth to the \\ncrack and began singing into it in a low voice. They could not catch the \\nwords, but evidently Merry was aroused. His legs began to kick. Tom sprang \\naway, and breaking off a hanging branch smote the side of the willow with \\nit. \\'You let them out again, Old Man Willow!\\' he said. \\'What be you \\na-thinking of? You should not be waking. Eat earth! Dig deep! Drink water! \\nGo to sleep! Bombadil is talking!\\' He then seized Merry\\'s feet and drew him \\nout of the suddenly widening crack. \\n\\nThere was a tearing creak and the other crack split open, and out of it \\nPippin sprang, as if he had been kicked. Then with a loud snap both cracks \\nclosed fast again. A shudder ran through the tree from root to tip, and \\ncomplete silence fell. \\n\\n\\'Thank you!\\' said the hobbits, one after the other. \\n\\nTom Bombadil burst out laughing. \\'Well, my little fellows!\\' said he, \\nstooping so that he peered into their faces. \\'You shall come home with me! \\nThe table is all laden with yellow cream, honeycomb, and white bread and \\nbutter. Goldberry is waiting. Time enough for questions around the supper \\ntable. You follow after me as quick as you are able!\\' With that he picked up \\nhis lilies, and then with a beckoning wave of his hand went hopping and \\ndancing along the path eastward, still singing loudly and nonsensically. \\n\\nToo surprised and too relieved to talk, the hobbits followed after him \\nas fast as they could. But that was not fast enough. Tom soon disappeared in \\nfront of them, and the noise of his singing got fainter and further away. \\nSuddenly his voice came floating back to them in a loud halloo! \\n\\nHop along, my little friends, up the Withywindle! \\n\\nTom\\'s going on ahead candles for to kindle. \\n\\nDown west sinks the Sun: soon you will be groping. \\n\\nWhen the night-shadows fall, then the door will open, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOut of the window-panes light will twinkle yellow. \\n\\nFear no alder black! Heed no hoary willow! \\n\\nFear neither root nor bough! Tom goes on before you. \\n\\nHey now! merry dot! We\\'ll be waiting for you! \\n\\nAfter that the hobbits heard no more. Almost at once the sun seemed to \\nsink into the trees behind them. They thought of the slanting light of \\nevening glittering on the Brandywine River, and the windows of Bucklebury \\nbeginning to gleam with hundreds of lights. Great shadows fell across them; \\ntrunks and branches of trees hung dark and threatening over the path. White \\nmists began to rise and curl on the surface of the river and stray about the \\nroots of the trees upon its borders. Out of the very ground at their feet a \\nshadowy steam arose and mingled with the swiftly falling dusk. \\n\\nIt became difficult to follow the path, and they were very tired. Their \\nlegs seemed leaden. Strange furtive noises ran among the bushes and reeds on \\neither side of them; and if they looked up to the pale sky, they caught \\nsight of queer gnarled and knobbly faces that gloomed dark against the \\ntwilight, and leered down at them from the high bank and the edges of the \\nwood. They began to feel that all this country was unreal, and that they \\nwere stumbling through an ominous dream that led to no awakening. \\n\\nJust as they felt their feet slowing down to a standstill, they noticed \\nthat the ground was gently rising. The water began to murmur. In the \\ndarkness they caught the white glimmer of foam, where the river flowed over \\na short fall. Then suddenly the trees came to an end and the mists were left \\nbehind. They stepped out from the Forest, and found a wide sweep of grass \\nwelling up before them. The river, now small and swift, was leaping merrily \\ndown to meet them, glinting here and there in the light of the stars, which \\nwere already shining in the sky. \\n\\nThe grass under their feet was smooth and short, as if it had been mown \\nor shaven. The eaves of the Forest behind were clipped, and trim as a hedge. \\nThe path was now plain before them, well -tended and bordered with stone. It \\nwound up on to the top of a grassy knoll, now grey under the pale starry \\nnight; and there, still high above them on a further slope, they saw the \\ntwinkling lights of a house. Down again the path went, and then up again, up \\na long smooth hillside of turf, towards the light. Suddenly a wide yellow \\nbeam flowed out brightly from a door that was opened. There was Tom \\nBombadil\\'s house before them, up, down, under hill. Behind it a steep \\nshoulder of the land lay grey and bare, and beyond that the dark shapes of \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe Barrow-downs stalked away into the eastern night. \\n\\nThey all hurried forward, hobbits and ponies. Already half their \\nweariness and all their fears had fallen from them. Hey! Come merry dol! \\nrolled out the song to greet them. \\n\\nHey! Come derry dol! Hop along, my hearties! \\n\\nHobbits! Ponies all! We are fond of parties. \\n\\nNow let the fun begin! Let us sing together! \\n\\nThen another clear voice, as young and as ancient as Spring, like the \\nsong of a glad water flowing down into the night from a bright morning in \\nthe hills, came falling like silver to meet them: \\n\\nNow let the song begin! Let us sing together \\n\\nOf sun, stars, moon and mist, rain and cloudy weather, \\n\\nLight on the budding leaf, dew on the feather, \\n\\nWind on the open hill, bells on the heather, \\n\\nReeds by the shady pool, lilies on the water: \\n\\nOld Tom Bombadil and the River-daughter! \\n\\nAnd with that song the hobbits stood upon the threshold, and a golden \\nlight was all about them. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 7 . In the House of Tom Bombadil \\n\\n\\n\\nThe four hobbits stepped over the wide stone threshold, and stood \\nstill, blinking. They were in a long low room, filled with the light of \\nlamps swinging from the beams of the roof; and on the table of dark polished \\nwood stood many candles, tall and yellow, burning brightly. \\n\\nIn a chair, at the far side of the room facing the outer door, sat a \\nwoman. Her long yellow hair rippled down her shoulders; her gown was \\ngreen, \\n\\ngreen as young reeds, shot with silver like beads of dew; and her belt was \\nof gold, shaped like a chain of flag-lilies set with the pale-blue eyes of \\nforget-me-nots. About her feel in wide vessels of green and brown \\nearthenware, white water-lilies were floating, so that she seemed to be \\nenthroned in the midst of a pool. \\n\\n\\'Enter, good guests!\\' she said, and as she spoke they knew that it was \\nher clear voice they had heard singing. They came a few timid steps further \\ninto the room, and began to bow low, feeling strangely surprised and \\nawkward, like folk that, knocking at a cottage door to beg for a drink of \\nwater, have been answered by a fair young elf-queen clad in living flowers. \\nBut before they could say anything, she sprang lightly up and over the \\nlily -bowls, and ran laughing towards them; and as she ran her gown rustled \\nsoftly like the wind in the flowering borders of a river. \\n\\n\\'Come dear folk!\\' she said, taking Frodo by the hand. Faugh and be \\nmerry! I am Goldberry, daughter of the River.\\' Then lightly she passed them \\nand closing the door she turned her back to it, with her white arms spread \\nout across it. \\'Let us shut out the night!\\' she said. \\'For you are still \\nafraid, perhaps, of mist and tree-shadows and deep water, and untame things. \\nFear nothing! For tonight you are under the roof of Tom Bombadil.\\' \\n\\nThe hobbits looked at her in wonder; and she looked at each of them and \\nsmiled. \\'Fair lady Goldberry!\\' said Frodo at last, feeling his heart moved \\nwith a joy that he did not understand. He stood as he had at times stood \\nenchanted by fair el ven- voices; but the spell that was now laid upon him was \\ndifferent: less keen and lofty was the delight, but deeper and nearer to \\nmortal heart; marvellous and yet not strange. \\'Fair lady Goldberry!\\' he said \\nagain. \\'Now the joy that was hidden in the songs we heard is made plain to \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nme. \\n\\nO slender as a willow-wand! O clearer than clear water ! \\n\\nO reed by the living pool! Fair River-daughter! \\n\\nO spring-time and summer-time, and spring again after! \\n\\nO wind on the waterfall, and the leaves\\' laughter!\\' \\n\\nSuddenly he stopped and stammered, overcome with surprise to hear \\nhimself saying such things. But Goldberry laughed. \\n\\n\\'Welcome!\\' she said. \\'I had not heard that folk of the Shire were so \\nsweet -tongued. But I see you are an elf-friend; the light in your eyes and \\nthe ring in your voice tells it. This is a merry meeting! Sit now, and wait \\nfor the Master of the house! He will not be long. He is tending your tired \\nbeasts.\\' \\n\\nThe hobbits sat down gladly in low rush-seated chairs, while Goldberry \\nbusied herself about the table; and their eyes followed her, for the slender \\ngrace of her movement filled them with quiet delight. From somewhere behind \\nthe house came the sound of singing. Every now and again they caught, among \\nmany a derry dol and a merry dol and a ring a ding dillo the repeated words: \\n\\nOld Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow; \\n\\nBright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow. \\n\\n\\'Fair lady!\\' said Frodo again after a while. \\'Tell me, if my asking \\ndoes not seem foolish, who is Tom Bombadil?\\' \\n\\n\\'He is,\\' said Goldberry, staying her swift movements and smiling. \\n\\nFrodo looked at her questioningly. \\'He is, as you have seen him,\\' she \\nsaid in answer to his look. \\'He is the Master of wood, water, and hill.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then all this strange land belongs to him?\\' \\n\\n\\'No indeed!\\' she answered, and her smile faded. \\'That would indeed be a \\nburden,\\' she added in a low voice, as if to herself. \\'The trees and the \\ngrasses and all things growing or living in the land belong each to \\nthemselves. Tom Bombadil is the Master. No one has ever caught old Tom \\nwalking in the forest, wading in the water, leaping on the hill-tops under \\nlight and shadow. He has no fear. Tom Bombadil is master.\\' \\n\\nA door opened and in came Tom Bombadil. He had now no hat and his \\nthick \\n\\nbrown hair was crowned with autumn leaves. He laughed, and going to \\nGoldberry, took her hand. \\n\\n\\'Here\\'s my pretty lady!\\' he said, bowing to the hobbits. \\'Here\\'s my \\nGoldberry clothed all in silver -green with flowers in her girdle! Is the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntable laden? I see yellow cream and honeycomb, and white bread, and butter; \\nmilk, cheese, and green herbs and ripe berries gathered. Is that enough for \\nus? Is the supper ready?\\' \\n\\n\\'It is,\\' said Goldberry; \\'but the guests perhaps are not?\\' \\n\\nTom clapped his hands and cried: \\'Tom, Tom! your guests are tired, and \\nyou had near forgotten! Come now, my merry friends, and Tom will refresh \\nyou! You shall clean grimy hands, and wash your weary faces; cast off your \\nmuddy cloaks and comb out your tangles!\\' \\n\\nHe opened the door, and they followed him down a short passage and \\nround a sharp turn. They came to a low room with a sloping roof (a \\npenthouse, it seemed, built on to the north end of the house). Its walls \\nwere of clean stone, but they were mostly covered with green hanging mats \\nand yellow curtains. The floor was flagged, and strewn with fresh green \\nrushes. There were four deep mattresses, each piled with white blankets, \\nlaid on the floor along one side. Against the opposite wall was a long bench \\nladen with wide earthenware basins, and beside it stood brown ewers filled \\nwith water, some cold, some steaming hot. There were soft green slippers set \\nready beside each bed. \\n\\nBefore long, washed and refreshed, the hobbits were seated at the \\ntable, two on each side, while at either end sat Goldberry and the Master. \\n\\nIt was a long and merry meal. Though the hobbits ate, as only famished \\nhobbits can eat, there was no lack. The drink in their drinking -bowls seemed \\nto be clear cold water, yet it went to their hearts like wine and set free \\ntheir voices. The guests became suddenly aware that they were singing \\nmerrily, as if it was easier and more natural than talking. \\n\\nAt last Tom and Goldberry rose and cleared the table swiftly. The \\nguests were commanded to sit quiet, and were set in chairs, each with a \\nfootstool to his tired feet. There was a fire in the wide hearth before \\nthem, and it was burning with a sweet smell, as if it were built of \\napple-wood. When everything was set in order, all the lights in the room \\nwere put out, except one lamp and a pair of candles at each end of the \\nchimney-shelf. Then Goldberry came and stood before them, holding a candle; \\nand she wished them each a good night and deep sleep. \\n\\n\\'Have peace now,\\' she said, \\'until the morning! Heed no nightly noises! \\n\\nFor nothing passes door and window here save moonlight and starlight and the \\nwind off the hill-top. Good night!\\' She passed out of the room with a \\nglimmer and a rustle. The sound of her footsteps was like a stream falling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngently away downhill over cool stones in the quiet of night. \\n\\nTom sat on a while beside them in silence, while each of them tried to \\nmuster the courage to ask one of the many questions he had meant to ask at \\nsupper. Sleep gathered on their eyelids. At last Frodo spoke: \\n\\n\\'Did you hear me calling, Master, or was it just chance that brought \\nyou at that moment?\\' \\n\\nTom stirred like a man shaken out of a pleasant dream. \\'Eh, what?\\' said \\nhe. \\'Did I hear you calling? Nay, I did not hear: I was busy singing. Just \\nchance brought me then, if chance you call it. It was no plan of mine, \\nthough I was waiting for you. We heard news of you, and learned that you \\nwere wandering. We guessed you\\'d come ere long down to the water: all paths \\nlead that way, down to Withywindle. Old grey Willow-man, he\\'s a mighty \\nsinger; and it\\'s hard for little folk to escape his cunning mazes. But Tom \\nhad an errand there, that he dared not hinder.\\' Tom nodded as if sleep was \\ntaking him again; but he went on in a soft singing voice: \\n\\nI had an errand there: gathering water-lilies, \\ngreen leaves and lilies white to please my pretty lady, \\nthe last ere the year\\'s end to keep them from the winter, \\nto flower by her pretty feet tilt the snows are melted. \\n\\nEach year at summer\\'s end I go to find them for her, \\nin a wide pool, deep and clear, far down Withywindle; \\nthere they open first in spring and there they linger latest. \\n\\nBy that pool long ago I found the River-daughter, \\nfair young Goldberry sitting in the rushes. \\n\\nSweet was her singing then, and her heart was beating! \\n\\nHe opened his eyes and looked at them with a sudden glint of blue: \\n\\nAnd that proved well for you -- for now I shall no longer \\ngo down deep again along the forest-water, \\nnot while the year is old. Nor shall I be passing \\nOld Man Willow\\'s house this side of spring-time, \\nnot till the merry spring, when the River-daughter \\ndances down the withy-path to bathe in the water. \\n\\nHe fell silent again; but Frodo could not help asking one more \\nquestion: the one he most desired to have answered. \\'Tell us, Master,\\' he \\nsaid, \\'about the Willow-man. What is he? I have never heard of him before.\\' \\n\\n\\'No, don\\'t!\\' said Merry and Pippin together, sitting suddenly upright. \\n\\n\\'Not now! Not until the morning!\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat is right!\\' said the old man. \\'Now is the time for resting. Some \\nthings are ill to hear when the world\\'s in shadow. Sleep till the \\nmorning -light, rest on the pillow ! Heed no nightly noise! Fear no grey \\nwillow!\\' And with that he took down the lamp and blew it out, and grasping a \\ncandle in either hand he led them out of the room. \\n\\nTheir mattresses and pillows were soft as down, and the blankets were \\nof white wool. They had hardly laid themselves on the deep beds and drawn \\nthe light covers over them before they were asleep. \\n\\nIn the dead night, Frodo lay in a dream without light. Then he saw the \\nyoung moon rising; under its thin light there loomed before him a black wall \\nof rock, pierced by a dark arch like a great gate. It seemed to Frodo that \\nhe was lifted up, and passing over he saw that the rock-wall was a circle of \\nhills, and that within it was a plain, and in the midst of the plain stood a \\npinnacle of stone, like a vast tower but not made by hands. On its top stood \\nthe figure of a man. The moon as it rose seemed to hang for a moment above \\nhis head and glistened in his white hair as the wind stirred it. Up from the \\ndark plain below came the crying of fell voices, and the howling of many \\nwolves. Suddenly a shadow, like the shape of great wings, passed across the \\nmoon. The figure lifted his arms and a light flashed from the staff that he \\nwielded. A mighty eagle swept down and bore him away. The voices wailed \\nand \\n\\nthe wolves yammered. There was a noise like a strong wind blowing, and on it \\nwas borne the sound of hoofs, galloping, galloping, galloping from the East. \\n\\'Black Riders!\\' thought Frodo as he wakened, with the sound of the hoofs \\nstill echoing in his mind. He wondered if he would ever again have the \\ncourage to leave the safety of these stone walls. He lay motionless, still \\nlistening; but all was now silent, and at last he turned and fell asleep \\nagain or wandered into some other unremembered dream. \\n\\nAt his side Pippin lay dreaming pleasantly; but a change came over his \\ndreams and he turned and groaned. Suddenly he woke, or thought he had \\nwaked, \\n\\nand yet still heard in the darkness the sound that had disturbed his dream: \\ntip-tap, squeak : the noise was like branches fretting in the wind, \\ntwig-fingers scraping wall and window: creak, creak, creak. He wondered if \\nthere were willow-trees close to the house; and then suddenly he had a \\ndreadful feeling that he was not in an ordinary house at all, but inside the \\nwillow and listening to that horrible dry creaking voice laughing at him \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nagain. He sat up, and felt the soft pillows yield to his hands, and he lay \\ndown again relieved. He seemed to hear the echo of words in his ears: \\'Fear \\nnothing! Have peace until the morning! Heed no nightly noises!\\' Then he went \\nto sleep again. \\n\\nIt was the sound of water that Merry heard falling into his quiet \\nsleep: water streaming down gently, and then spreading, spreading \\nirresistibly all round the house into a dark shoreless pool. It gurgled \\nunder the walls, and was rising slowly but surely. \\'I shall be drowned!\\' he \\nthought. It will find its way in, and then I shall drown.\\' He felt that he \\nwas lying in a soft slimy bog, and springing up he set his fool on the \\ncorner of a cold hard flagstone. Then he remembered where he was and lay \\ndown again. He seemed to hear or remember hearing: \\'Nothing passes doors or \\nwindows save moonlight and starlight and the wind off the hill-top.\\' A \\nlittle breath of sweet air moved the curtain. He breathed deep and fell \\nasleep again. \\n\\nAs far as he could remember, Sam slept through the night in deep \\ncontent, if logs are contented. \\n\\nThey woke up, all four at once, in the morning light. Tom was moving \\nabout the room whistling like a starling. When he heard them stir he clapped \\nhis hands, and cried: \\'Hey! Come merry dol! derry dol! My hearties!\\' He drew \\nback the yellow curtains, and the hobbits saw that these had covered the \\nwindows, at either end of the room, one looking east and the other looking \\nwest. \\n\\nThey leapt up refreshed. Frodo ran to the eastern window, and found \\nhimself looking into a kitchen-garden grey with dew. He had half expected to \\nsee turf right up to the walls, turf all pocked with hoof-prints. Actually \\nhis view was screened by a tall line of beans on poles; but above and far \\nbeyond them the grey top of the hill loomed up against the sunrise. It was a \\npale morning: in the East, behind long clouds like lines of soiled wool \\nstained red at the edges, lay glimmering deeps of yellow. The sky spoke of \\nrain to come; but the light was broadening quickly, and the red flowers on \\nthe beans began to glow against the wet green leaves. \\n\\nPippin looked out of the western window, down into a pool of mist. The \\nForest was hidden under a fog. It was like looking down on to a sloping \\ncloud-roof from above. There was a fold or channel where the mist was broken \\ninto many plumes and billows; the valley of the Withywindle. The stream ran \\ndown the hill on the left and vanished into the white shadows. Near at hand \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwas a flower-garden and a clipped hedge silver -netted, and beyond that grey \\nshaven grass pale with dew-drops. There was no willow-tree to be seen. \\n\\n\\'Good morning, merry friends!\\' cried Tom, opening the eastern window \\nwide. A cool air flowed in; it had a rainy smell. \\'Sun won\\'t show her face \\nmuch today. I\\'m thinking. I have been walking wide, leaping on the hilltops, \\nsince the grey dawn began, nosing wind and weather, wet grass underfoot, wet \\nsky above me. I wakened Goldberry singing under window; but nought \\nwakes \\n\\nhobbit-folk in the early morning. In the night little folk wake up in the \\ndarkness, and sleep after light has come! Ring a ding dillo! Wake now, my \\nmerry friends! Forget the nightly noises! Ring a ding dillo del! derry del, \\nmy hearties! If you come soon you\\'ll find breakfast on the table. If you \\ncome late you\\'ll get grass and rain-water!\\' \\n\\nNeedless to say - not that Tom\\'s threat sounded very serious - the \\nhobbits came soon, and left the table late and only when it was beginning lo \\nlook rather empty. Neither Tom nor Goldberry were there. Tom could be heard \\nabout the house, clattering in the kitchen, and up and down the stairs, and \\nsinging here and there outside. The room looked westward over the \\nmist-clouded valley, and the window was open. Water dripped down from the \\nthatched eaves above. Before they had finished breakfast the clouds had \\njoined into an unbroken roof, and a straight grey rain came softly and \\nsteadily down. Behind its deep curtain the Forest was completely veiled. \\n\\nAs they looked out of the window there came falling gently as if it was \\nflowing down the rain out of the sky, the clear voice of Goldberry singing \\nup above them. They could hear few words, but it seemed plain to them that \\nthe song was a rain-song, as sweet as showers on dry hills, that told the \\ntale of a river from the spring in the highlands to the Sea far below. The \\nhobbits listened with delight; and Frodo was glad in his heart, and blessed \\nthe kindly weather, because it delayed them from departing. The thought of \\ngoing had been heavy upon him from the moment he awoke; but he guessed \\nnow \\n\\nthat they would not go further that day. \\n\\nThe upper wind settled in the West and deeper and wetter clouds rolled \\nup to spill their laden rain on the bare heads of the Downs. Nothing could \\nbe seen all round the house but falling water. Frodo stood near the open \\ndoor and watched the white chalky path turn into a little river of milk and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngo bubbling away down into the valley. Tom Bombadil came trotting round \\nthe \\n\\ncorner of the house, waving his arms as if he was warding off the rain - and \\nindeed when he sprang over the threshold he seemed quite dry, except for his \\nboots. These he took off and put in the chimney-corner. Then he sat in the \\nlargest chair and called the hobbits to gather round him. \\n\\nThis is Goldberry\\'s washing day,\\' he said, \\'and her autumn-cleaning. \\n\\nToo wet for hobbit-folk - let them rest while they are able! It\\'s a good day \\nfor long tales, for questions and for answers, so Tom will start the \\ntalking.\\' \\n\\nHe then told them many remarkable stories, sometimes half as if \\nspeaking to himself, sometimes looking at them suddenly with a bright blue \\neye under his deep brows. Often his voice would turn to song, and he would \\nget out of his chair and dance about. He told them tales of bees and \\nflowers, the ways of trees, and the strange creatures of the Forest, about \\nthe evil things and good things, things friendly and things unfriendly, \\ncruel things and kind things, and secrets hidden under brambles. \\n\\nAs they listened, they began to understand the lives of the Forest, \\napart from themselves, indeed to feel themselves as the strangers where all \\nother things were at home. Moving constantly in and out of his talk was Old \\nMan Willow, and Frodo learned now enough to content him, indeed more \\nthan \\n\\nenough, for it was not comfortable lore. Tom\\'s words laid bare the hearts of \\ntrees and their thoughts, which were often dark and strange, and filled with \\na hatred of things that go free upon the earth, gnawing, biting, breaking, \\nhacking, burning: destroyers and usurpers. It was not called the Old Forest \\nwithout reason, for it was indeed ancient, a survivor of vast forgotten \\nwoods; and in it there lived yet, ageing no quicker than the hills, the \\nfathers of the fathers of trees, remembering times when they were lords. The \\ncountless years had filled them with pride and rooted wisdom, and with \\nmalice. But none were more dangerous than the Great Willow: his heart was \\nrotten, but his strength was green; and he was cunning, and a master of \\nwinds, and his song and thought ran through the woods on both sides of the \\nriver. His grey thirsty spirit drew power out of the earth and spread like \\nfine root-threads in the ground, and invisible twig-fingers in the air, till \\nit had under its dominion nearly all the trees of the Forest from the Hedge \\nto the Downs. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSuddenly Tom\\'s talk left the woods and went leaping up the young \\nstream, over bubbling waterfalls, over pebbles and worn rocks, and among \\nsmall flowers in close grass and wet crannies, wandering at last up on to \\nthe Downs. They heard of the Great Barrows, and the green mounds, and the \\nstone-rings upon the hills and in the hollows among the hills. Sheep were \\nbleating in flocks. Green walls and white walls rose. There were fortresses \\non the heights. Kings of little kingdoms fought together, and the young Sun \\nshone like fire on the red metal of their new and greedy swords. There was \\nvictory and defeat; and towers fell, fortresses were burned, and flames went \\nup into the sky. Gold was piled on the biers of dead kings and queens; and \\nmounds covered them, and the stone doors were shut; and the grass grew over \\nall. Sheep walked for a while biting the grass, but soon the hills were \\nempty again. A shadow came out of dark places far away, and the bones were \\nstirred in the mounds. Barrow- wights walked in the hollow places with a \\nclink of rings on cold fingers, and gold chains in the wind.\\' Stone rings \\ngrinned out of the ground like broken teeth in the moonlight. \\n\\nThe hobbits shuddered. Even in the Shire the rumour of the \\nBarrow- wights of the Barrow-downs beyond the Forest had been heard. But it \\nwas not a tale that any hobbit liked to listen to, even by a comfortable \\nfireside far away. These four now suddenly remembered what the joy of this \\nhouse had driven from their minds: the house of Tom Bombadil nestled under \\nthe very shoulder of those dreaded hills. They lost the thread of his tale \\nand shifted uneasily, looking aside at one another. \\n\\nWhen they caught his words again they found that he had now wandered \\ninto strange regions beyond their memory and beyond their waking thought, \\ninto limes when the world was wider, and the seas flowed straight to the \\nwestern Shore; and still on and back Tom went singing out into ancient \\nstarlight, when only the Elf-sires were awake. Then suddenly he slopped, and \\nthey saw that he nodded as if he was falling asleep. The hobbits sat still \\nbefore him, enchanted; and it seemed as if, under the spell of his words, \\nthe wind had gone, and the clouds had dried up, and the day had been \\nwithdrawn, and darkness had come from East and West, and all the sky was \\nfilled with the light of white stars. \\n\\nWhether the morning and evening of one day or of many days had passed \\nFrodo could not tell. Ele did not feel either hungry or tired, only filled \\nwith wonder. The stars shone through the window and the silence of the \\nheavens seemed to be round him. He spoke at last out of his wonder and a \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsudden fear of that silence: \\n\\n\\'Who are you, Master?\\' he asked. \\n\\n\\'Eh, what?\\' said Tom sitting up, and his eyes glinting in the gloom. \\n\\n\\'Don\\'t you know my name yet? That\\'s the only answer. Tell me, who are you, \\nalone, yourself and nameless? But you are young and I am old. Eldest, that\\'s \\nwhat I am. Mark my words, my friends: Tom was here before the river and the \\ntrees; Tom remembers the first raindrop and the first acorn. He made paths \\nbefore the Big People, and saw the little People arriving. He was here \\nbefore the Kings and the graves and the Barrow- wights. When the Elves passed \\nwestward, Tom was here already, before the seas were bent. He knew the dark \\nunder the stars when it was fearless - before the Dark Lord came from \\nOutside.\\' \\n\\nA shadow seemed to pass by the window, and the hobbits glanced hastily \\nthrough the panes. When they turned again, Goldberry stood in the door \\nbehind, framed in light. She held a candle, shielding its flame from the \\ndraught with her hand; and the light flowed through it, like sunlight \\nthrough a white shell. \\n\\n\\'The rain has ended,\\' she said; \\'and new waters are running downhill, \\nunder the stars. Let us now laugh and be glad!\\' \\n\\n\\'And let us have food and drink!\\' cried Tom. \\'Long tales are thirsty. \\n\\nAnd long listening\\'s hungry work, morning, noon, and evening!\\' With that he \\njumped out of his chair, and with a bound took a candle from the \\nchimney-shelf and lit it in the flame that Goldberry held; then he danced \\nabout the table. Suddenly he hopped through the door and disappeared. \\n\\nQuickly he returned, bearing a large and laden tray. Then Tom and \\nGoldberry set the table; and the hobbits sat half in wonder and half in \\nlaughter: so fair was the grace of Goldberry and so merry and odd the \\ncaperings of Tom. Yet in some fashion they seemed to weave a single dance, \\nneither hindering the other, in and out of the room, and round about the \\ntable; and with great speed food and vessels and lights were set in order. \\n\\nThe boards blazed with candles, white and yellow. Tom bowed to his guests. \\n\\'Supper is ready,\\' said Goldberry; and now the hobbits saw that she was \\nclothed all in silver with a white girdle, and her shoes were like fishes\\' \\nmail. But Tom was all in clean blue, blue as rain-washed forget-me-nots, and \\nhe had green stockings. \\n\\nIt was a supper even better than before. The hobbits under the spell of \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTom\\'s words may have missed one meal or many, but when the food was \\nbefore \\n\\nthem it seemed at least a week since they had eaten. They did not sing or \\neven speak much for a while, and paid close attention to business. But after \\na time their hearts and spirit rose high again, and their voices rang out in \\nmirth and laughter. \\n\\nAfter they had eaten, Goldberry sang many songs for them, songs that \\nbegan merrily in the hills and fell softly down into silence; and in the \\nsilences they saw in their minds pools and waters wider than any they had \\nknown, and looking into them they saw the sky below them and the stars like \\njewels in the depths. Then once more she wished them each good night and \\nleft them by the fireside. But Tom now seemed wide awake and plied them \\nwith \\n\\nquestions. \\n\\nHe appeared already to know much about them and all their families, and \\nindeed to know much of all the history and doings of the Shire down from \\ndays hardly remembered among the hobbits themselves. It no longer surprised \\nthem; but he made no secret that he owed his recent knowledge largely to \\nFarmer Maggot, whom he seemed to regard as a person of more importance \\nthan \\n\\nthey had imagined. \\'There\\'s earth under his old feet, and clay on his \\nfingers; wisdom in his bones, and both his eyes are open,\\' said Tom. It was \\nalso clear that Tom had dealings with the Elves, and it seemed that in some \\nfashion, news had reached him from Gildor concerning the flight of Frodo. \\n\\nIndeed so much did Tom know, and so cunning was his questioning, that \\nFrodo found himself telling him more about Bilbo and his own hopes and fears \\nthan he had told before even to Gandalf. Tom wagged his head up and down, \\nand there was a glint in his eyes when he heard of the Riders. \\n\\n\\'Show me the precious Ring!\\' he said suddenly in the midst of the \\nstory: and Frodo, to his own astonishment, drew out the chain from his \\npocket, and unfastening the Ring handed it at once to Tom. \\n\\nIt seemed to grow larger as it lay for a moment on his big \\nbrown-skinned hand. Then suddenly he put it to his eye and laughed. For a \\nsecond the hobbits had a vision, both comical and alarming, of his bright \\nblue eye gleaming through a circle of gold. Then Tom put the Ring round the \\nend of his little finger and held it up to the candlelight. For a moment the \\nhobbits noticed nothing strange about this. Then they gasped. There was no \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsign of Tom disappearing! \\n\\nTom laughed again, and then he spun the Ring in the air - and it \\nvanished with a flash. Frodo gave a cry - and Tom leaned forward and handed \\nit back to him with a smile. \\n\\nFrodo looked at it closely, and rather suspiciously (like one who has \\nlent a trinket to a juggler). It was the same Ring, or looked the same and \\nweighed the same: for that Ring had always seemed to Frodo to weigh \\nstrangely heavy in the hand. But something prompted him to make sure. He \\nwas \\n\\nperhaps a trifle annoyed with Tom for seeming to make so light of what even \\nGandalf thought so perilously important. He waited for an opportunity, when \\nthe talk was going again, and Tom was telling an absurd story about badgers \\nand their queer ways - then he slipped the Ring on. \\n\\nMerry turned towards him to say something and gave a start, and checked \\nan exclamation. Frodo was delighted (in a way): it was his own ring all \\nright, for Merry was staring blankly at his chair, and obviously could not \\nsee him. He got up and crept quietly away from the fireside towards the \\nouter door. \\n\\n\\'Hey there!\\' cried Tom, glancing towards him with a most seeing look in \\nhis shining eyes. \\'Hey! Come Frodo, there! Where be you a-going? Old Tom \\nBombadil\\'s not as blind as that yet. Take off your golden ring! Your hand\\'s \\nmore fair without it. Come back! Leave your game and sit down beside me! \\nWe \\n\\nmust talk a while more, and think about the morning. Tom must teach the \\nright road, and keep your feet from wandering.\\' \\n\\nFrodo laughed (trying to feel pleased), and taking off the Ring he came \\nand sat down again. Tom now told them that he reckoned the Sun would shine \\ntomorrow, and it would be a glad morning, and setting out would be hopeful. \\nBut they would do well to start early; for weather in that country was a \\nthing that even Tom could not be sure of for long, and it would change \\nsometimes quicker than he could change his jacket. \\'I am no weather-master,\\' \\nhe said; \\'nor is aught that goes on two legs.\\' \\n\\nBy his advice they decided to make nearly due North from his house, \\nover the western and lower slopes of the Downs: they might hope in that way \\nto strike the East Road in a day\\'s journey, and avoid the Barrows. He told \\nthem not to be afraid - but to mind their own business. \\n\\n\\'Keep to the green grass. Don\\'t you go a-meddling with old stone or \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncold Wights or prying in their houses, unless you be strong folk with hearts \\nthat never falter!\\' He said this more than once; and he advised them to pass \\nbarrows by on the west-side, if they chanced to stray near one. Then he \\ntaught them a rhyme to sing, if they should by ill-luck fall into any danger \\nor difficulty the next day. \\n\\nHo! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo! \\n\\nBy water, wood and hill, by the reed and willow, \\n\\nBy fire, sun and moon, harken now and hear us! \\n\\nCome, Tom Bombadil, for our need is near us! \\n\\nWhen they had sung this altogether after him, he clapped them each on \\nthe shoulder with a laugh, and taking candles led them back to their \\nbedroom. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 8 . Fog on the Barrow-Downs \\n\\n\\n\\nThat night they heard no noises. But either in his dreams or out of \\nthem, he could not tell which, Frodo heard a sweet singing running in his \\nmind; a song that seemed to come like a pale light behind a grey \\nrain-curtain, and growing stronger to turn the veil all to glass and silver, \\nuntil at last it was rolled back, and a far green country opened before him \\nunder a swift sunrise. \\n\\nThe vision melted into waking; and there was Tom whistling like a \\ntree-full of birds; and the sun was already slanting down the hill and \\nthrough the open window. Outside everything was green and pale gold. \\n\\nAfter breakfast, which they again ate alone, they made ready to say \\nfarewell, as nearly heavy of heart as was possible on such a morning: cool, \\nbright, and clean under a washed autumn sky of thin blue. The air came fresh \\nfrom the North-west. Their quiet ponies were almost frisky, sniffing and \\nmoving restlessly. Tom came out of the house and waved his hat and danced \\nupon the doorstep, bidding the hobbits to get up and be off and go with good \\nspeed. \\n\\nThey rode off along a path that wound away from behind the house, and \\nwent slanting up towards the north end of the hill -brow under which it \\nsheltered. They had just dismounted to lead their ponies up the last steep \\nslope, when suddenly Frodo stopped. \\n\\n\\'Goldberry!\\' he cried. \\'My fair lady, clad all in silver green! We have \\nnever said farewell to her, nor seen her since the evening!\\' He was so \\ndistressed that he turned back; but at that moment a clear call came \\nrippling down. There on the hill-brow she stood beckoning to them: her hair \\nwas flying loose, and as it caught the sun it shone and shimmered. A light \\nlike the glint of water on dewy grass flashed from under her feet as she \\ndanced. \\n\\nThey hastened up the last slope, and stood breathless beside her. They \\nbowed, but with a wave of her arm she bade them look round; and they looked \\nout from the hill-top over lands under the morning. It was now as clear and \\nfar-seen as it had been veiled and misty when they stood upon the knoll in \\nthe Forest, which could now be seen rising pale and green out of the dark \\ntrees in the West. In that direction the land rose in wooded ridges, green, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyellow, russet under the sun, beyond which lay hidden the valley of the \\nBrandywine. To the South, over the line of the Withywindle, there was a \\ndistant glint like pale glass where the Brandywine River made a great loop \\nin the lowlands and flowed away out of the knowledge of the hobbits. \\nNorthward beyond the dwindling downs the land ran away in flats and \\nswellings of grey and green and pale earth -colours, until it faded into a \\nfeatureless and shadowy distance. Eastward the Barrow-downs rose, ridge \\nbehind ridge into the morning, and vanished out of eyesight into a guess: it \\nwas no more than a guess of blue and a remote white glimmer blending with \\nthe hem of the sky, but it spoke to them, out of memory and old tales, of \\nthe high and distant mountains. \\n\\nThey took a deep draught of the air, and felt that a skip and a few \\nstout strides would bear them wherever they wished. It seemed fainthearted \\nto go jogging aside over the crumpled skirts of the downs towards the Road, \\nwhen they should be leaping, as lusty as Tom, over the stepping stones of \\nthe hills straight towards the Mountains. \\n\\nGoldberry spoke to them and recalled their eyes and thoughts. \\'Speed \\nnow, fair guests!\\' she said. \\'And hold to your purpose! North with the wind \\nin the left eye and a blessing on your footsteps! Make haste while the Sun \\nshines!\\' And to Frodo she said: \\'Farewell, Elf-friend, it was a merry \\nmeeting!\\' \\n\\nBut Frodo found no words to answer. He bowed low, and mounted his pony, \\nand followed by his friends jogged slowly down the gentle slope behind the \\nhill. Tom Bombadil\\'s house and the valley, and the Forest were lost to view. \\nThe air grew warmer between the green walls of hillside and hillside, and \\nthe scent of turf rose strong and sweet as they breathed. Turning back, when \\nthey reached the bottom of the green hollow, they saw Goldberry, now small \\nand slender like a sunlit flower against the sky: she was standing still \\nwatching them, and her hands were stretched out towards them. As they looked \\nshe gave a clear call, and lifting up her hand she turned and vanished \\nbehind the hill . \\n\\nTheir way wound along the floor of the hollow, and round the green feet \\nof a steep hill into another deeper and broader valley, and then over the \\nshoulder of further hills, and down their long limbs, and up their smooth \\nsides again, up on to new hill-tops and down into new valleys. There was no \\ntree nor any visible water: it was a country of grass and short springy \\nturf, silent except for the whisper of the air over the edges of the land, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand high lonely cries of strange birds. As they journeyed the sun mounted, \\nand grew hot. Each time they climbed a ridge the breeze seemed to have grown \\nless. When they caught a glimpse of the country westward the distant Forest \\nseemed to be smoking, as if the fallen rain was steaming up again from leaf \\nand root and mould. A shadow now lay round the edge of sight, a dark haze \\nabove which the upper sky was like a blue cap, hot and heavy. \\n\\nAbout mid-day they came to a hill whose top was wide and flattened, \\nlike a shallow saucer with a green mounded rim. Inside there was no air \\nstirring, and the sky seemed near their heads. They rode across and looked \\nnorthwards. Then their hearts rose, for it seemed plain that they had come \\nfurther already than they had expected. Certainly the distances had now all \\nbecome hazy and deceptive, but there could be no doubt that the Downs were \\ncoming to an end. A long valley lay below them winding away northwards, \\nuntil it came to an opening between two steep shoulders. Beyond, there \\nseemed to be no more hills. Due north they faintly glimpsed a long dark \\nline. That is a line of trees,\\' said Merry, \\'and that must mark the Road. \\n\\nAll along it for many leagues east of the Bridge there are trees growing. \\n\\nSome say they were planted in the old days.\\' \\n\\n\\'Splendid!\\' said Frodo. \\'If we make as good going this afternoon as we \\nhave done this morning, we shall have left the Downs before the Sun sets and \\nbe jogging on in search of a camping place.\\' But even as he spoke he turned \\nhis glance eastwards, and he saw that on that side the hills were higher and \\nlooked down upon them; and all those hills were crowned with green mounds, \\nand on some were standing stones, pointing upwards like jagged teeth out of \\ngreen gums. \\n\\nThat view was somehow disquieting; so they turned from the sight and \\nwent down into the hollow circle. In the midst of it there stood a single \\nstone, standing tall under the sun above, and at this hour casting no \\nshadow. It was shapeless and yet significant: like a landmark, or a guarding \\nfinger, or more like a warning. But they were now hungry, and the sun was \\nstill at the fearless noon; so they set their backs against the east side of \\nthe stone. It was cool, as if the sun had had no power to warm it; but at \\nthat time this seemed pleasant. There they took food and drink, and made as \\ngood a noon-meal under the open sky as anyone could wish; for the food came \\nfrom \\'down under Hill\\'. Tom had provided them with plenty for the comfort of \\nthe day. Their ponies unburdened strayed upon the grass. \\n\\nRiding over the hills, and eating their fill, the warm sun and the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nscent of turf, lying a little too long, stretching out their legs and \\nlooking at the sky above their noses: these things are, perhaps, enough to \\nexplain what happened. However, that may be: they woke suddenly and \\nuncomfortably from a sleep they had never meant to take. The standing stone \\nwas cold, and it cast a long pale shadow that stretched eastward over them. \\nThe sun, a pale and watery yellow, was gleaming through the mist just above \\nthe west wall of the hollow in which they lay; north, south, and east, \\nbeyond the wall the fog was thick, cold and white. The air was silent, heavy \\nand chill. Their ponies were standing crowded together with their heads \\ndown. \\n\\nThe hobbits sprang to their feet in alarm, and ran to the western rim. \\n\\nThey found that they were upon an island in the fog. Even as they looked out \\nin dismay towards the setting sun, it sank before their eyes into a white \\nsea, and a cold grey shadow sprang up in the East behind. The fog rolled up \\nto the walls and rose above them, and as it mounted it bent over their heads \\nuntil it became a roof: they were shut in a hall of mist whose central \\npillar was the standing stone. \\n\\nThey felt as if a trap was closing about them; but they did not quite \\nlose heart. They still remembered the hopeful view they had had of the line \\nof the Road ahead, and they still knew in which direction it lay. In any \\ncase, they now had so great a dislike for that hollow place about the stone \\nthat no thought of remaining there was in their minds. They packed up as \\nquickly as their chilled fingers would work. \\n\\nSoon they were leading their ponies in single file over the rim and \\ndown the long northward slope of the hill, down into a foggy sea. As they \\nwent down the mist became colder and damper, and their hair hung lank and \\ndripping on their foreheads. When they reached the bottom it was so cold \\nthat they halted and got out cloaks and hoods, which soon became bedewed \\nwith grey drops. Then, mounting their ponies, they went slowly on again, \\nfeeling their way by the rise and fall of the ground. They were steering, as \\nwell as they could guess, for the gate-like opening at the far northward end \\nof the long valley which they had seen in the morning. Once they were \\nthrough the gap, they had only lo keep on in anything like a straight line \\nand they were bound in the end to strike the Road. Their thoughts did not go \\nbeyond that, except for a vague hope that perhaps away beyond the Downs \\nthere might be no fog. \\n\\nTheir going was very slow. To prevent their getting separated and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwandering in different directions they went in file, with Frodo leading. Sam \\nwas behind him, and after him came Pippin, and then Merry. The valley \\nseemed \\n\\nto stretch on endlessly. Suddenly Frodo saw a hopeful sign. On either side \\nahead a darkness began to loom through the mist; and he guessed that they \\nwere at last approaching the gap in the hills, the north-gate of the \\nBarrow-downs. If they could pass that, they would be free. \\n\\n\\'Come on! Follow me!\\' he called back over his shoulder, and he hurried \\nforward. But his hope soon changed to bewilderment and alarm. The dark \\npatches grew darker, but they shrank; and suddenly he saw, towering ominous \\nbefore him and leaning slightly towards one another like the pillars of a \\nheadless door, two huge standing stones. He could not remember having seen \\nany sign of these in the valley, when he looked out from the hill in the \\nmorning. He had passed between them almost before he was aware: and even \\nas \\n\\nhe did so darkness seemed to fall round him. His pony reared and snorted, \\nand he fell off. When he looked back he found that he was alone: the others \\nhad not followed him. \\'Sam!\\' he called. \\'Pippin! Merry! Come along! Why \\ndon\\'t you keep up?\\' \\n\\nThere was no answer. Fear took him, and he ran back past the stones \\nshouting wildly: \\'Sam! Sam! Merry! Pippin!\\' The pony bolted into the mist \\nand vanished. From some way off, or so it seemed, he thought he heard a cry: \\n\\'Hoy! Frodo! Hoy!\\' It was away eastward, on his left as he stood under the \\ngreat stones, staring and straining into the gloom. He plunged off in the \\ndirection of the call, and found himself going steeply uphill. \\n\\nAs he struggled on he called again, and kept on calling more and more \\nfrantically; but he heard no answer for some time, and then it seemed faint \\nand far ahead and high above him. \\'Frodo! Hoy!\\' came the thin voices out of \\nthe mist: and then a cry that sounded like help, help! often repeated, \\nending with a last help! that trailed off into a long wail suddenly cut \\nshort. He stumbled forward with all the speed he could towards the cries; \\nbut the light was now gone, and clinging night had closed about him, so that \\nit was impossible to be sure of any direction. He seemed all the time to be \\nclimbing up and up. \\n\\nOnly the change in the level of the ground at his feet told him when he \\nat last came to the top of a ridge or hill. He was weary, sweating and yet \\nchilled. It was wholly dark. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Where are you?\\' he cried out miserably. \\n\\nThere was no reply. He stood listening. He was suddenly aware that it \\nwas getting very cold, and that up here a wind was beginning to blow, an icy \\nwind. A change was coming in the weather. The mist was flowing past him \\nnow \\n\\nin shreds and tatters. His breath was smoking, and the darkness was less \\nnear and thick. He looked up and saw with surprise that faint stars were \\nappearing overhead amid the strands of hurrying cloud and fog. The wind \\nbegan to hiss over the grass. \\n\\nHe imagined suddenly that he caught a muffled cry, and he made towards \\nit; and even as he went forward the mist was rolled up and thrust aside, and \\nthe starry sky was unveiled. A glance showed him that he was now facing \\nsouthwards and was on a round hill-top, which he must have climbed from the \\nnorth. Out of the east the biting wind was blowing. To his right there \\nloomed against the westward stars a dark black shape. A great barrow stood \\nthere. \\n\\n\\'Where are you?\\' he cried again, both angry and afraid. \\n\\n\\'Here!\\' said a voice, deep and cold, that seemed to come out of the \\nground. \\'I am waiting for you!\\' \\n\\n\\'No!\\' said Frodo; but he did not run away. His knees gave, and he fell \\non the ground. Nothing happened, and there was no sound. Trembling he \\nlooked \\n\\nup, in time to see a tall dark figure like a shadow against the stars. It \\nleaned over him. He thought there were two eyes, very cold though lit with a \\npale light that seemed to come from some remote distance. Then a grip \\nstronger and colder than iron seized him. The icy touch froze his bones, and \\nhe remembered no more. \\n\\nWhen he came to himself again, for a moment he could recall nothing \\nexcept a sense of dread. Then suddenly he knew that he was imprisoned, \\ncaught hopelessly; he was in a barrow. A Barrow-wight had taken him, and he \\nwas probably already under the dreadful spells of the Barrow- wights about \\nwhich whispered tales spoke. He dared not move, but lay as he found himself: \\nflat on his back upon a cold stone with his hands on his breast. \\n\\nBut though his fear was so great that it seemed to be part of the very \\ndarkness that was round him, he found himself as he lay thinking about Bilbo \\nBaggins and his stories, of their jogging along together in the lanes of the \\nShire and talking about roads and adventures. There is a seed of courage \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhidden (often deeply, it is true) in the heart of the fattest and most timid \\nhobbit, wailing for some final and desperate danger to make it grow. Frodo \\nwas neither very fat nor very timid; indeed, though he did not know it, \\n\\nBilbo (and Gandalf) had thought him the best hobbit in the Shire. He thought \\nhe had come to the end of his adventure, and a terrible end, but the thought \\nhardened him. He found himself stiffening, as if for a final spring; he no \\nlonger felt limp like a helpless prey. \\n\\nAs he lay there, thinking and getting a hold of himself, he noticed all \\nat once that the darkness was slowly giving way: a pale greenish light was \\ngrowing round him. It did not at first show him what kind of a place he was \\nin, for the light seemed to be coming out of himself, and from the floor \\nbeside him, and had not yet reached the roof or wall. He turned, and there \\nin the cold glow he saw lying beside him Sam, Pippin, and Merry. They were \\non their backs, and their faces looked deathly pale; and they were clad in \\nwhite. About them lay many treasures, of gold maybe, though in that light \\nthey looked cold and unlovely. On their heads were circlets, gold chains \\nwere about their waists, and on their fingers were many rings. Swords lay by \\ntheir sides, and shields were at their feet. But across their three necks \\nlay one long naked sword. \\n\\nSuddenly a song began: a cold murmur, rising and falling. The voice \\nseemed far away and immeasurably dreary, sometimes high in the air and thin, \\nsometimes like a low moan from the ground. Out of the formless stream of sad \\nbut horrible sounds, strings of words would now and again shape themselves: \\ngrim, hard, cold words, heartless and miserable. The night was railing \\nagainst the morning of which it was bereaved, and the cold was cursing the \\nwarmth for which it hungered. Frodo was chilled to the marrow. After a while \\nthe song became clearer, and with dread in his heart he perceived that it \\nhad changed into an incantation: \\n\\nCold be hand and heart and bone, \\n\\nand cold be sleep under stone: \\n\\nnever mare to wake on stony bed, \\n\\nnever, till the Sun fails and the Moon is dead. \\n\\nIn the black wind the stars shall die, \\nand still on gold here let them lie, \\ntill the dark lord lifts his hand \\nover dead sea and withered land. \\n\\nHe heard behind his head a creaking and scraping sound. Raising himself \\n\\n\\n\\n\\non one arm he looked, and saw now in the pale light that they were in a kind \\nof passage which behind them turned a corner. Round the corner a long arm \\nwas groping, walking on its fingers towards Sam, who was lying nearest, and \\ntowards the hilt of the sword that lay upon him. \\n\\nAt first Frodo felt as if he had indeed been turned into stone by the \\nincantation. Then a wild thought of escape came to him. He wondered if he \\nput on the Ring, whether the Barrow-wight would miss him, and he might find \\nsome way out. He thought of himself running free over the grass, grieving \\nfor Merry, and Sam, and Pippin, but free and alive himself. Gandalf would \\nadmit that there had been nothing else he could do. \\n\\nBut the courage that had been awakened in him was now too strong: he \\ncould not leave his friends so easily. He wavered, groping in his pocket, \\nand then fought with himself again; and as he did so the arm crept nearer. \\nSuddenly resolve hardened in him, and he seized a short sword that lay \\nbeside him, and kneeling he stooped low over the bodies of his companions. \\nWith what strength he had he hewed at the crawling arm near the wrist, and \\nthe hand broke off; but at the same moment the sword splintered up to the \\nhilt. There was a shriek and the light vanished. In the dark there was a \\nsnarling noise. \\n\\nFrodo fell forward over Merry, and Merry\\'s face felt cold. All at once \\nback into his mind, from which it had disappeared with the first coming of \\nthe fog, came the memory of the house down under the Hill, and of Tom \\nsinging. He remembered the rhyme that Tom had taught them. In a small \\ndesperate voice he began: Ho! Tom Bombadil! and with that name his voice \\nseemed to grow strong: it had a full and lively sound, and the dark chamber \\nechoed as if to drum and trumpet. \\n\\nHo! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo! \\n\\nBy water, wood and hill, by the reed and willow, \\n\\nBy fire, sun and moon, harken now and hear us! \\n\\nCome, Tom Bombadil, for our need is near us! \\n\\nThere was a sudden deep silence, in which Frodo could hear his heart \\nbeating. After a long slow moment he heard plain, but far away, as if it was \\ncoming down through the ground or through thick walls, an answering voice \\nsinging: \\n\\nOld Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow, \\n\\nBright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow. \\n\\nNone has ever caught him yet, for Tom, he is the master: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHis songs are stronger songs, and his feet are faster. \\n\\nThere was a loud rumbling sound, as of stones rolling and falling, and \\nsuddenly light streamed in, real light, the plain light of day. A low \\ndoor -like opening appeared at the end of the chamber beyond Frodo\\'s feet; \\nand there was Tom\\'s head (hat, feather, and all) framed against the light of \\nthe sun rising red behind him. The light fell upon the floor, and upon the \\nfaces of the three hobbits lying beside Frodo. They did not stir, but the \\nsickly hue had left them. They looked now as if they were only very deeply \\nasleep. \\n\\nTom stooped, removed his hat, and came into the dark chamber, singing: \\n\\nGet out, you old Wight! Vanish in the sunlight! \\n\\nShrivel like the cold mist, like the winds go wailing, \\n\\nOut into the barren lands far beyond the mountains! \\n\\nCome never here again! Leave your barrow empty! \\n\\nLost and forgotten be, darker than the darkness, \\n\\nWhere gates stand for ever shut, till the world is mended. \\n\\nAt these words there was a cry and part of the inner end of the chamber \\nfell in with a crash. Then there was a long trailing shriek, fading away \\ninto an unguessable distance; and after that silence. \\n\\n\\'Come, friend Frodo!\\' said Tom. \\'Let us get out on to clean grass! You \\nmust help me bear them.\\' \\n\\nTogether they carried out Merry, Pippin, and Sam. As Frodo left the \\nbarrow for the last time he thought he saw a severed hand wriggling still, \\nlike a wounded spider, in a heap of fallen earth. Tom went back in again, \\nand there was a sound of much thumping and stamping. When he came out he \\nwas \\n\\nbearing in his arms a great load of treasure: things of gold, silver, \\ncopper, and bronze; many beads and chains and jewelled ornaments. He \\nclimbed \\n\\nthe green barrow and laid them all on top in the sunshine. \\n\\nThere he stood, with his hat in his hand and the wind in his hair, and \\nlooked down upon the three hobbits, that had been laid on their backs upon \\nthe grass at the west side of the mound. Raising his right hand he said in a \\nclear and commanding voice: \\n\\nWake now my merry tads! Wake and hear me calling! \\n\\nWarm now be heart and limb! The cold stone is fallen; \\n\\nDark door is standing wide; dead hand is broken. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNight under Night is flown, and the Gate is open! \\n\\nTo Frodo\\'s great joy the hobbits stirred, stretched their arms, rubbed \\ntheir eyes, and then suddenly sprang up. They looked about in amazement, \\nfirst at Frodo, and then at Tom standing large as life on the barrow-top \\nabove them; and then at themselves in their thin white rags, crowned and \\nbelted with pale gold, and jingling with trinkets. \\n\\n\\'What in the name of wonder?\\' began Merry, feeling the golden circlet \\nthat had slipped over one eye. Then he stopped, and a shadow came over his \\nface, and he closed his eyes. \\'Of course, I remember!\\' he said. \\'The men of \\nCarn Dym came on us at night, and we were worsted. Ah! the spear in my \\nheart!\\' He clutched at his breast. \\'No! No!\\' he said, opening his eyes. \\n\\n\\'What am I saying? I have been dreaming. Where did you get to, Frodo?\\' \\n\\n\\'I thought that I was lost,\\' said Frodo; \\'but I don\\'t want to speak of \\nit. Let us think of what we are to do now! Let us go on!\\' \\n\\n\\'Dressed up like this, sir?\\' said Sam. \\'Where are my clothes?\\' He flung \\nhis circlet, belt, and rings on the grass, and looked round helplessly, as \\nif he expected to find his cloak, jacket, and breeches, and other \\nhobbit-garments lying somewhere to hand. \\n\\n\\'You won\\'t find your clothes again,\\' said Tom, bounding down from the \\nmound, and laughing as he danced round them in the sunlight. One would have \\nthought that nothing dangerous or dreadful had happened; and indeed the \\nhorror faded out of their hearts as they looked at him, and saw the merry \\nglint in his eyes. \\n\\n\\'What do you mean?\\' asked Pippin, looking at him, half puzzled and half \\namused. \\'Why not?\\' \\n\\nBut Tom shook his head, saying: \\'You\\'ve found yourselves again, out of \\nthe deep water. Clothes are but little loss, if you escape from drowning. Be \\nglad, my merry friends, and let the warm sunlight heal now heart and limb! \\nCast off these cold rags! Run naked on the grass, while Tom goes a-hunting!\\' \\n\\nHe sprang away down hill, whistling and calling. Looking down after him \\nFrodo saw him running away southwards along the green hollow between \\ntheir \\n\\nhill and the next, still whistling and crying: \\n\\nHey! now! Come hoy now! Whither do you wander? \\n\\nUp, down, near or far, here, there or yonder? \\n\\nSharp-ears, Wise-nose, Swish-tail and Bumpkin, \\n\\nWhite-socks my little lad, and old Fatty Lumpkin! \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo he sang, running fast, tossing up his hat and catching it, until he \\nwas hidden by a fold of the ground: but for some time his hey now! hoy now! \\ncame floating back down the wind, which had shifted round towards the south. \\n\\nThe air was growing very warm again. The hobbits ran about for a while \\non the grass, as he told them. Then they lay basking in the sun with the \\ndelight of those that have been wafted suddenly from bitter winter to a \\nfriendly clime, or of people that, after being long ill and bedridden, wake \\none day to find that they are unexpectedly well and the day is again full of \\npromise. \\n\\nBy the time that Tom returned they were feeling strong (and hungry). He \\nreappeared, hat first, over the brow of the hill, and behind him came in an \\nobedient line six ponies: their own five and one more. The last was plainly \\nold Fatty Lumpkin: he was larger, stronger, fatter (and older) than their \\nown ponies. Merry, to whom the others belonged, had not, in fact, given them \\nany such names, but they answered to the new names that Tom had given \\nthem \\n\\nfor the rest of their lives. Tom called them one by one and they climbed \\nover the brow and stood in a line. Then Tom bowed to the hobbits. \\n\\n\\'Here are your ponies, now!\\' he said. \\'They\\'ve more sense (in some \\nways) than you wandering hobbits have - more sense in their noses. For they \\nsniff danger ahead which you walk right into; and if they run to save \\nthemselves, then they run the right way. You must forgive them all; for \\nthough their hearts are faithful, to face fear of Barrow- wights is not what \\nthey were made for. See, here they come again, bringing all their burdens!\\' \\n\\nMerry, Sam, and Pippin now clothed themselves in spare garments from \\ntheir packs; and they soon felt too hot, for they were obliged to put on \\nsome of the thicker and warmer things that they had brought against the \\noncoming of winter. \\n\\n\\'Where does that other old animal, that Fatty Lumpkin, come from?\\' \\nasked Frodo. \\n\\n\\'He\\'s mine,\\' said Tom. \\'My four-legged friend; though I seldom ride \\nhim, and he wanders often far, free upon the hillsides. When your ponies \\nstayed with me, they got to know my Lumpkin; and they smelt him in the \\nnight, and quickly ran to meet him. I thought he\\'d look for them and with \\nhis words of wisdom take all their fear away. But now, my jolly Lumpkin, old \\nTom\\'s going to ride. Hey! he\\'s coming with you, just to set you on the road; \\nso he needs a pony. For you cannot easily talk to hobbits that are riding, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhen you\\'re on your own legs trying to trot beside them.\\' \\n\\nThe hobbits were delighted to hear this, and thanked Tom many times; \\nbut he laughed, and said that they were so good at losing themselves that he \\nwould not feel happy till he had seen them safe over the borders of his \\nland. Tve got things to do,\\' he said: \\'my making and my singing, my \\ntalking and my walking, and my watching of the country. Tom can\\'t be always \\nnear to open doors and willow-cracks. Tom has his house to mind, and \\nGoldberry is waiting.\\' \\n\\nIt was still fairly early by the sun, something between nine and ten, \\nand the hobbits turned their minds to food. Their last meal had been lunch \\nbeside the standing stone the day before. They breakfasted now off the \\nremainder of Tom\\'s provisions, meant for their supper, with additions that \\nTom had brought with him. It was not a large meal (considering hobbits and \\nthe circumstances), but they felt much better for it. While they were eating \\nTom went up to the mound, and looked through the treasures. Most of these he \\nmade into a pile that glistened and sparkled on the grass. He bade them lie \\nthere \\'free to all finders, birds, beasts. Elves or Men, and all kindly \\ncreatures\\'; for so the spell of the mound should be broken and scattered and \\nno Wight ever come back to it. He chose for himself from the pile a brooch \\nset with blue stones, many-shaded like flax-flowers or the wings of blue \\nbutterflies. He looked long at it, as if stirred by some memory, shaking his \\nhead, and saying at last: \\n\\n\\'Here is a pretty toy for Tom and for his lady! Fair was she who long \\nago wore this on her shoulder. Goldberry shall wear it now, and we will not \\nforget her!\\' \\n\\nFor each of the hobbits he chose a dagger, long, leaf-shaped, and keen, \\nof marvellous workmanship, damasked with serpent-forms in red and gold. \\nThey \\n\\ngleamed as he drew them from their black sheaths, wrought of some strange \\nmetal, light and strong, and set with many fiery stones. Whether by some \\nvirtue in these sheaths or because of the spell that lay on the mound, the \\nblades seemed untouched by time, unrusted, sharp, glittering in the sun. \\n\\n\\'Old knives are long enough as swords for hobbit-people,\\' he said. \\n\\n\\'Sharp blades are good to have, if Shire-folk go walking, east, south, or \\nfar away into dark and danger.\\' Then he told them that these blades were \\nforged many long years ago by Men of Westernesse: they were foes of the \\nDark \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLord, but they were overcome by the evil king of Carn Dym in the Land of \\nAngmar. \\n\\n\\'Few now remember them,\\' Tom murmured, \\'yet still some go wandering, \\nsons of forgotten kings walking in loneliness, guarding from evil things \\nfolk that are heedless.\\' \\n\\nThe hobbits did not understand his words, but as he spoke they had a \\nvision as it were of a great expanse of years behind them, like a vast \\nshadowy plain over which there strode shapes of Men, tall and grim with \\nbright swords, and last came one with a star on his brow. Then the vision \\nfaded, and they were back in the sunlit world. It was time to start again. \\n\\nThey made ready, packing their bags and lading their ponies. Their new \\nweapons they hung on their leather belts under their jackets, feeling them \\nvery awkward, and wondering if they would be of any use. Fighting had not \\nbefore occurred to any of them as one of the adventures in which their \\nflight would land them. \\n\\nAt last they set off. They led their ponies down the hill; and then \\nmounting they trotted quickly along the valley. They looked back and saw the \\ntop of the old mound on the hill, and from it the sunlight on the gold went \\nup like a yellow flame. Then they turned a shoulder of the Downs and it was \\nhidden from view. \\n\\nThough Frodo looked about him on every side he saw no sign of the great \\nstones standing like a gate, and before long they came to the northern gap \\nand rode swiftly through, and the land fell away before them. It was a merry \\njourney with Tom Bombadil trotting gaily beside them, or before them, on \\nFatty Lumpkin, who could move much faster than his girth promised. Tom \\nsang \\n\\nmost of the time, but it was chiefly nonsense, or else perhaps a strange \\nlanguage unknown to the hobbits, an ancient language whose words were \\nmainly \\n\\nthose of wonder and delight. \\n\\nThey went forward steadily, but they soon saw that the Road was further \\naway than they had imagined. Even without a fog, their sleep at mid-day \\nwould have prevented them from reaching it until after nightfall on the day \\nbefore. The dark line they had seen was not a line of trees but a line of \\nbushes growing on the edge of a deep dike with a steep wall on the further \\nside. Tom said that it had once been the boundary of a kingdom, but a very \\nlong lime ago. He seemed to remember something sad about it, and would not \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsay much. \\n\\nThey climbed down and out of the dike and through a gap in the wall, \\nand then Tom turned due north, for they had been bearing somewhat to the \\nwest. The land was now open and fairly level, and they quickened their pace, \\nbut the sun was already sinking low when at last they saw a line of tall \\ntrees ahead, and they knew that they had come back to the Road after many \\nunexpected adventures. They galloped their ponies over the last furlongs, \\nand halted under the long shadows of the trees. They were on the top of a \\nsloping bank, and the Road, now dim as evening drew on, wound away \\nbelow \\n\\nthem. At this point it ran nearly from South-west to North-east, and on \\ntheir right it fell quickly down into a wide hollow. It was rutted and bore \\nmany signs of the recent heavy rain; there were pools and pot-holes full of \\nwater. They rode down the bank and looked up and down. There was nothing \\nto \\n\\nbe seen. \\'Well, here we are again at last!\\' said Frodo. \\'I suppose we \\nhaven\\'t lost more than two days by my short cut through the Forest! But \\nperhaps the delay will prove useful - it may have put them off our trail.\\' \\n\\nThe others looked at him. The shadow of the fear of the Black Riders \\ncame suddenly over them again. Ever since they had entered the Forest they \\nhad thought chiefly of getting back to the Road; only now when it lay \\nbeneath their feet did they remember the danger which pursued them, and was \\nmore than likely to be lying in wait for them upon the Road itself. They \\nlooked anxiously back towards the setting sun, but the Road was brown and \\nempty. \\n\\n\\'Do you think,\\' asked Pippin hesitatingly, \\'do you think we may be \\npursued, tonight?\\' \\n\\n\\'No, I hope not tonight,\\' answered Tom Bombadil; \\'nor perhaps the next \\nday. But do not trust my guess; for I cannot tell for certain. Out east my \\nknowledge fails. Tom is not master of Riders from the Black Land far beyond \\nhis country.\\' \\n\\nAll the same the hobbits wished he was coming with them. They felt that \\nhe would know how to deal with Black Riders, if anyone did. They would \\nsoon \\n\\nnow be going forward into lands wholly strange to them, and beyond all but \\nthe most vague and distant legends of the Shire, and in the gathering \\ntwilight they longed for home. A deep loneliness and sense of loss was on \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthem. They stood silent, reluctant to make the final parting, and only \\nslowly became aware that Tom was wishing them farewell, and telling them to \\nhave good heart and to ride on till dark without halting. \\n\\n\\'Tom will give you good advice, till this day is over (after that your \\nown luck must go with you and guide you): four miles along the Road you\\'ll \\ncome upon a village, Bree under Bree-hill, with doors looking westward. \\nThere you\\'ll find an old inn that is called The Prancing Pony. Barliman \\nButterbur is the worthy keeper. There you can stay the night, and afterwards \\nthe morning will speed you upon your way. Be bold, but wary! Keep up your \\nmerry hearts, and ride to meet your fortune!\\' \\n\\nThey begged him to come at least as far as the inn and drink once more \\nwith them; but he laughed and refused, saying: \\n\\nTom\\'s country ends here: he will not pass the borders. \\n\\nTom has his house to mind, and Goldberry is waiting! \\n\\nThen he turned, tossed up his hat, leaped on Lumpkin\\'s back, and rode \\nup over the bank and away singing into the dusk. \\n\\nThe hobbits climbed up and watched him until he was out of sight. \\n\\n\\'I am sorry to take leave of Master Bombadil,\\' said Sam. \\'He\\'s a \\ncaution and no mistake. I reckon we may go a good deal further and see \\nnaught better, nor queerer. But I won\\'t deny I\\'ll be glad to see this \\nPrancing Pony he spoke of. I hope it\\'ll be like The Green Dragon away back \\nhome! What sort of folk are they in Bree?\\' \\n\\n\\'There are hobbits in Bree,\\' said Merry, \\'as well as Big Folk. I \\ndaresay it will be homelike enough. The Pony is a good inn by all accounts. \\n\\nMy people ride out there now and again.\\' \\n\\n\\'It may be all we could wish,\\' said Frodo; \\'but it is outside the Shire \\nall the same. Don\\'t make yourselves too much at home ! Please remember -all \\nof you - that the name of Baggins must NOT be mentioned. I am Mr. Underhill, \\nif any name must be given.\\' \\n\\nThey now mounted their ponies and rode off silently into the evening. \\nDarkness came down quickly, as they plodded slowly downhill and up again, \\nuntil at last they saw lights twinkling some distance ahead. \\n\\nBefore them rose Bree-hill barring the way, a dark mass against misty \\nstars; and under its western flank nestled a large village. Towards it they \\nnow hurried desiring only to find a fire, and a door between them and the \\nnight. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 9 . At the Sign of \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Prancing Pony \\n\\nBree was the chief village of the Bree-land, a small inhabited region, \\nlike an island in the empty lands round about. Besides Bree itself, there \\nwas Staddle on the other side of the hill, Combe in a deep valley a little \\nfurther eastward, and Archet on the edge of the Chetwood. Lying round \\nBree-hill and the villages was a small country of fields and tamed woodland \\nonly a few miles broad. \\n\\nThe Men of Bree were brown-haired, broad, and rather short, cheerful \\nand independent: they belonged to nobody but themselves; but they were more \\nfriendly and familiar with Hobbits, Dwarves, Elves, and other inhabitants of \\nthe world about them than was (or is) usual with Big People. According to \\ntheir own tales they were the original inhabitants and were the descendants \\nof the first Men that ever wandered into the West of the middle-world. Few \\nhad survived the turmoils of the Elder Days; but when the Kings returned \\nagain over the Great Sea they had found the Bree-men still there, and they \\nwere still there now, when the memory of the old Kings had faded into the \\ngrass. \\n\\nIn those days no other Men had settled dwellings so far west, or within \\na hundred leagues of the Shire. But in the wild lands beyond Bree there were \\nmysterious wanderers. The Bree-folk called them Rangers, and knew nothing \\nof \\n\\ntheir origin. They were taller and darker than the Men of Bree and were \\nbelieved to have strange powers of sight and hearing, and to understand the \\nlanguages of beasts and birds. They roamed at will southwards, and eastwards \\neven as far as the Misty Mountains; but they were now few and rarely seen. \\nWhen they appeared they brought news from afar, and told strange forgotten \\ntales which were eagerly listened to; but the Bree-folk did not make friends \\nof them. \\n\\nThere were also many families of hobbits in the Bree-land and they \\nclaimed to be the oldest settlement of Hobbits in the world, one that was \\nfounded long before even the Brandywine was crossed and the Shire colonized. \\nThey lived mostly in Staddle though there were some in Bree itself, \\nespecially on the higher slopes of the hill, above the houses of the Men. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Big Folk and the Little Folk (as they called one another) were on \\nfriendly terms, minding their own affairs in their own ways, but both \\nrightly regarding themselves as necessary parts of the Bree-folk. Nowhere \\nelse in the world was this peculiar (but excellent) arrangement to be found. \\n\\nThe Bree-folk, Big and Little, did not themselves travel much; and the \\naffairs of the four villages were their chief concern. Occasionally the \\nHobbits of Bree went as far as Buckland, or the Eastfarthing; but though \\ntheir link land was not much further than a day\\'s riding east of the \\nBrandywine Bridge, the Hobbits of the Shire now seldom visited it. An \\noccasional Bucklander or adventurous Took would come out to the Inn for a \\nnight or two, but even that was becoming less and less usual. The \\nShire-hobbits referred to those of Bree, and to any others that lived beyond \\nthe borders, as Outsiders, and took very little interest in them, \\nconsidering them dull and uncouth. There were probably many more \\nOutsiders \\n\\nscattered about in the West of the World in those days than the people of \\nthe Shire imagined. Some, doubtless, were no better than tramps, ready to \\ndig a hole in any bank and stay only as long as it suited them. But in the \\nBree-land, at any rate, the hobbits were decent and prosperous, and no more \\nrustic than most of their distant relatives Inside. It was not yet forgotten \\nthat there had been a time when there was much coming and going between \\nthe \\n\\nShire and Bree. There was Bree-blood in the Brandybucks by all accounts. \\n\\nThe village of Bree had some hundred stone houses of the Big Folk, \\nmostly above the Road, nestling on the hillside with windows looking west. \\nOn that side, running in more than half a circle from the hill and back to \\nit, there was a deep dike with a thick hedge on the inner side. Over this \\nthe Road crossed by a causeway; but where it pierced the hedge it was barred \\nby a great gate. There was another gate in the southern comer where the Road \\nran out of the village. The gates were closed at nightfall; but just inside \\nthem were small lodges for the gatekeepers. \\n\\nDown on the Road, where it swept to the right to go round the foot of \\nthe hill, there was a large inn. It had been built long ago when the traffic \\non the roads had been far greater. For Bree stood at an old meeting of ways; \\nanother ancient road crossed the East Road just outside (he dike at the \\nwestern end of the village, and in former days Men and other folk of various \\nsorts had travelled much on it. Strange as News from Bree was still a saying \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nin the Eastfarthing, descending from those days, when news from North, \\nSouth, and East could be heard in the inn, and when the Shire-hobbits used \\nto go more often to hear it. But the Northern Lands had long been desolate, \\nand the North Road was now seldom used: it was grass-grown, and the \\nBree-folk called it the Greenway. \\n\\nThe Inn of Bree was still there, however, and the innkeeper was an \\nimportant person. His house was a meeting place for the idle, talkative, and \\ninquisitive among the inhabitants, large and small, of the four villages; \\nand a resort of Rangers and other wanderers, and for such travellers (mostly \\ndwarves) as still journeyed on the East Road, to and from the Mountains. \\n\\nIt was dark, and white stars were shining, when Frodo and his \\ncompanions came at last to the Greenway-crossing and drew near the village. \\nThey came to the West-gate and found it shut, but at the door of the lodge \\nbeyond it, there was a man sitting. He jumped up and fetched a lantern and \\nlooked over the gate at them in surprise. \\n\\n\\'What do you want, and where do you come from?\\' he asked gruffly. \\n\\n\\'We are making for the inn here,\\' answered Frodo. \\'We are journeying \\neast and cannot go further tonight.\\' \\n\\n\\'Hobbits ! Four hobbits ! And what\\'s more, out of the Shire by their \\ntalk,\\' said the gatekeeper, softly as if speaking to himself. He stared at \\nthem darkly for a moment, and then slowly opened the gate and let them ride \\nthrough. \\n\\n\\'We don\\'t often see Shire-folk riding on the Road at night,\\' he went \\non, as they halted a moment by his door. \\'You\\'ll pardon my wondering what \\nbusiness takes you away east of Bree! What may your names be, might I ask?\\' \\n\\n\\'Our names and our business are our own, and this does not seem a good \\nplace to discuss them,\\' said Frodo, not liking the look of the man or the \\ntone of his voice. \\n\\n\\'Your business is your own, no doubt,\\' said the man; \\'but it\\'s my \\nbusiness to ask questions after nightfall.\\' \\n\\n\\'We are hobbits from Buckland, and we have a fancy to travel and to \\nstay at the inn here,\\' put in Merry. \\'I am Mr. Brandybuck. Is that enough \\nfor you? The Bree-folk used to be fair-spoken to travellers, or so I had \\nheard.\\' \\n\\n\\'All right, all right!\\' said the man. \\'I meant no offence. But you\\'ll \\nfind maybe that more folk than old Harry at the gate will be asking you \\nquestions. There\\'s queer folk about. If you go on to The Pony, you\\'ll find \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyou\\'re oat the only guests.\\' \\n\\nHe wished them good night, and they said no more; but Frodo could see \\nin the lantern-light that the man was still eyeing them curiously. He was \\nglad to hear the gate clang to behind them, as they rode forward. He \\nwondered why the man was so suspicious, and whether any one had been \\nasking \\n\\nfor news of a party of hobbits. Could it have been Gandalf? He might have \\narrived, while they were delayed in the Forest and the Downs. But there was \\nsomething in the look and the voice of the gatekeeper that made him uneasy. \\n\\nThe man stared after the hobbits for a moment, and then he went back to \\nhis house. As soon as his back was turned, a dark figure climbed quickly in \\nover the gate and melted into the shadows of the village street. \\n\\nThe hobbits rode on up a gentle slope, passing a few detached houses, \\nand drew up outside the inn. The houses looked large and strange to them. \\nSam stared up at the inn with its three storeys and many windows, and felt \\nhis heart sink. He had imagined himself meeting giants taller than trees, \\nand other creatures even more terrifying, some time or other in the course \\nof his journey; but at the moment he was finding his first sight of Men and \\ntheir tall houses quite enough, indeed too much for the dark end of a tiring \\nday. He pictured black horses standing all saddled in the shadows of the \\ninn-yard, and Black Riders peering out of dark upper windows. \\n\\n\\'We surely aren\\'t going to stay here for the night, are we, sir?\\' he \\nexclaimed. \\'If there are hobbit-folk in these pans, why don\\'t we look for \\nsome that would be willing to take us in? It would be more homelike.\\' \\n\\n\\'What\\'s wrong with the inn?\\' said Frodo. \\'Tom Bombadil recommended it. \\nI expect it\\'s homelike enough inside.\\' \\n\\nEven from the outside the inn looked a pleasant house to familiar eyes. \\n\\nIt had a front on the Road, and two wings running back on land partly cut \\nout of the lower slopes of the hill, so that at the rear the second-floor \\nwindows were level with the ground. There was a wide arch leading to a \\ncourtyard between the two wings, and on the left under the arch there was a \\nlarge doorway reached by a few broad steps. The door was open and light \\nstreamed out of it. Above the arch there was a lamp, and beneath it swung a \\nlarge signboard: a fat white pony reared up on its hind legs. Over the door \\nwas painted in white letters: THE PRANCING PONY by BARLIMAN \\nBUTTERBUR. Many \\n\\nof the lower windows showed lights behind thick curtains. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs they hesitated outside in the gloom, someone began singing a merry \\nsong inside, and many cheerful voices joined loudly in the chorus. They \\nlistened to this encouraging sound for a moment and then got off their \\nponies. The song ended and there was a burst of laughter and clapping. \\n\\nThey led their ponies under the arch, and leaving them standing in the \\nyard they climbed up the steps. Frodo went forward and nearly bumped into a \\nshort fat man with a bald head and a red face. He had a white apron on, and \\nwas bustling out of one door and in through another, carrying a tray laden \\nwith full mugs. \\n\\n\\'Can we--\\' began Frodo. \\n\\n\\'Half a minute, if you please!\\' shouted the man over his shoulder, and \\nvanished into a babel of voices and a cloud of smoke. In a moment he was out \\nagain, wiping his hands on his apron. \\n\\n\\'Good evening, little master!\\' he said, bending down. \\'What may you be \\nwanting?\\' \\n\\n\\'Beds for four, and stabling for five ponies, if that can be managed. \\n\\nAre you Mr. Butterbur?\\' \\n\\n\\'That\\'s right! Barliman is my name. Barliman Butterbur at your service! \\nYou\\'re from the Shire, eh?\\' he said, and then suddenly he clapped his hand \\nto his forehead, as if trying to remember something. \\'Hobbits!\\' he cried. \\n\\n\\'Now what does that remind me of? Might I ask your names, sir?\\' \\n\\n\\'Mr. Took and Mr. Brandybuck,\\' said Frodo; \\'and this is Sam Gamgee. My \\nname is Underhill.\\' \\n\\n\\'There now!\\' said Mr. Butterbur, snapping his fingers. \\'It\\'s gone \\nagain! But it\\'ll come back, when I have time to think. I\\'m run off my feet; \\nbut I\\'ll see what I can do for you. We don\\'t often get a party out of the \\nShire nowadays, and I should be sorry not to make you welcome. But there is \\nsuch a crowd already in the house tonight as there hasn\\'t been for long \\nenough. It never rains but it pours, we say in Bree. \\n\\n\\'Hi! Nob!\\' he shouted. \\'Where are you, you woolly -footed slow-coach? \\nNob!\\' \\n\\n\\'Coming, sir! Coming!\\' A cheery-looking hobbit bobbed out of a door, \\nand seeing the travellers, stopped short and stared at them with great \\ninterest. \\n\\n\\'Where\\'s Bob?\\' asked the landlord. \\'You don\\'t know? Well find him! \\nDouble sharp! I haven\\'t got six legs, nor six eyes neither! Tell Bob there\\'s \\nfive ponies that have to be stabled. He must find room somehow.\\' Nob trotted \\n\\n\\n\\n\\noff with a grin and a wink. \\n\\n\\'Well, now, what was I going to say?\\' said Mr. Butterbur, tapping his \\nforehead. \\'One thing drives out another, so to speak. I\\'m that busy tonight, \\nmy head is going round. There\\'s a party that came up the Greenway from \\ndown \\n\\nSouth last night - and that was strange enough to begin with. Then there\\'s a \\ntravelling company of dwarves going West come in this evening. And now \\nthere\\'s you. If you weren\\'t hobbits, I doubt if we could house you. But \\nwe\\'ve got a room or two in the north wing that were made special for \\nhobbits, when this place was built. On the ground floor as they usually \\nprefer; round windows and all as they like it. I hope you\\'ll be comfortable. \\nYou\\'ll be wanting supper, I don\\'t doubt. As soon as may be. This way now!\\' \\n\\nHe led them a short way down a passage, and opened a door. \\'Here is a \\nnice little parlour!\\' he said. \\'I hope it will suit. Excuse me now. I\\'m that \\nbusy. No time for talking. I must be trotting. It\\'s hard work for two legs, \\nbut I don\\'t get thinner. I\\'ll look in again later. If you want anything, \\nring the hand-bell, and Nob will come. If he don\\'t come, ring and shout!\\' \\n\\nOff he went at last, and left them feeling rather breathless. He seemed \\ncapable of an endless stream of talk, however busy he might be. They found \\nthemselves in a small and cosy room. There was a bit of bright fire burning \\non the hearth, and in front of it were some low and comfortable chairs. \\nThere was a round table, already spread with a white cloth, and on it was a \\nlarge hand-bell. But Nob, the hobbit servant, came bustling in long before \\nthey thought of ringing. He brought candles and a tray full of plates. \\n\\n\\'Will you be wanting anything to drink, masters?\\' he asked. \\'And shall \\nI show you the bedrooms, while your supper is got ready?\\' \\n\\nThey were washed and in the middle of good deep mugs of beer when Mr. \\nButterbur and Nob came in again. In a twinkling the table was laid. There \\nwas hot soup, cold meats, a blackberry tart, new loaves, slabs of butter, \\nand half a ripe cheese: good plain food, as good as the Shire could show, \\nand homelike enough to dispel the last of Sam\\'s misgivings (already much \\nrelieved by the excellence of the beer). \\n\\nThe landlord hovered round for a link, and then prepared to leave them. \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know whether you would care to join the company, when you have \\nsupped,\\' he said, standing at the door. \\'Perhaps you would rather go to your \\nbeds. Still the company would be very pleased to welcome you, if you had a \\nmind. We don\\'t get Outsiders - travellers from the Shire, I should say, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbegging your pardon - often; and we like to hear a bit of news, or any story \\nor song you may have in mind. But as you please! Ring the bell, if you lack \\nanything!\\' \\n\\nSo refreshed and encouraged did they feel at the end of their supper \\n(about three quarters of an hour\\'s steady going, not hindered by unnecessary \\ntalk) that Frodo, Pippin, and Sam decided to join the company. Merry said it \\nwould be too stuffy. \\'I shall sit here quietly by the fire for a bit, and \\nperhaps go out later for a sniff of the air. Mind your Ps and Qs, and don\\'t \\nforget that you are supposed to be escaping in secret, and are still on the \\nhigh-road and not very far from the Shire!\\' \\n\\n\\'All right!\\' said Pippin. \\'Mind yourself! Don\\'t get lost, and don\\'t \\nforget that it is safer indoors!\\' \\n\\nThe company was in the big common-room of the inn. The gathering was \\nlarge and mixed, as Frodo discovered, when his eyes got used to the light. \\n\\nThis came chiefly from a blazing log-fire, for the three lamps hanging from \\nthe beams were dim, and half veiled in smoke. Barliman Butterbur was \\nstanding near the fire, talking to a couple of dwarves and one or two \\nstrange-looking men. On the benches were various folk: men of Bree, a \\ncollection of local hobbits (sitting chattering together), a few more \\ndwarves, and other vague figures difficult to make out away in the shadows \\nand comers. \\n\\nAs soon as the Shire-hobbits entered, there was a chorus of welcome \\nfrom the Bree-landers. The strangers, especially those that had come up the \\nGreenway, stared at them curiously. The landlord introduced the newcomers to \\nthe Bree-folk, so quickly that, though they caught many names, they were \\nseldom sure who the names belonged to. The Men of Bree seemed all to have \\nrather botanical (and to the Shire-folk rather odd) names, like Rushlight, \\nGoatleaf, Heathertoes, Appledore, Thistlewool and Ferny (not to mention \\nButterbur). Some of the hobbits had similar names. The Mug worts, for \\ninstance, seemed numerous. But most of them had natural names, such as \\nBanks, Brockhouse, Longholes, Sandheaver, and Tunnelly, many of which \\nwere \\n\\nused in the Shire. There were several Underhills from Saddle, and as they \\ncould not imagine sharing a name without being related, they took Frodo to \\ntheir hearts as a long-lost cousin. \\n\\nThe Bree-hobbits were, in fact, friendly and inquisitive, and Frodo \\nsoon found that some explanation of what he was doing would have to be \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngiven. He gave out that he was interested in history and geography (at which \\nthere was much wagging of heads, although neither of these words were much \\nused in the Bree-dialect). He said he was thinking of writing a book (at \\nwhich there was silent astonishment), and that he and his friends wanted to \\ncollect information about hobbits living outside the Shire, especially in \\nthe eastern lands. \\n\\nAt this a chorus of voices broke out. If Frodo had really wanted to \\nwrite a book, and had had many ears, he would have learned enough for \\nseveral chapters in a few minutes. And if that was not enough, he was given \\na whole list of names, beginning with \\'Old Barliman here\\', to whom he could \\ngo for further information. But after a time, as Frodo did not show any sign \\nof writing a book on the spot, the hobbits returned to their questions about \\ndoings in the Shire. Frodo did not prove very communicative, and he soon \\nfound himself sitting alone in a comer, listening and looking around. \\n\\nThe Men and Dwarves were mostly talking of distant events and telling \\nflews of a kind that was becoming only too familiar. There was trouble away \\nin the South, and it seemed that the Men who had come up the Greenway \\nwere \\n\\non the move, looking for lands where they could find some peace. The \\nBree-folk were sympathetic, but plainly not very ready to take a large \\nnumber of strangers into their little land. One of the travellers, a \\nsquint-eyed ill-favoured fellow, was foretelling that more and more people \\nwould be coming north in the near future. \\'If room isn\\'t found for them, \\nthey\\'ll find it for themselves. They\\'ve a right to live, same as other \\nfolk,\\' he said loudly. The local inhabitants did not look pleased at the \\nprospect. \\n\\nThe hobbits did not pay much attention to all this, and it did not at \\nthe moment seem to concern hobbits. Big Folk could hardly beg for lodgings \\nin hobbit-holes. They were more interested in Sam and Pippin, who were now \\nfeeling quite at home, and were chatting gaily about events in the Shire. \\nPippin roused a good deal of laughter with an account of the collapse of the \\nroof of the Town Hole in Michel Delving: Will Whitfoot, the Mayor, and the \\nfattest hobbit in the Westfarthing, had been buried in chalk, and came out \\nlike a floured dumpling. But there were several questions asked that made \\nFrodo a little uneasy. One of the Bree-landers, who seemed to have been in \\nthe Shire several times, wanted to know where the Underhills lived and who \\nthey were related to. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSuddenly Frodo noticed that a strange-looking weather-beaten man, \\nsitting in the shadows near the wall, was also listening intently to the \\nhobbit-talk. He had a tall tankard in front of him, and was smoking a \\nlong-stemmed pipe curiously carved. His legs were stretched out before him, \\nshowing high boots of supple leather that fitted him well, but had seen much \\nwear and were now caked with mud. A travel -stained cloak of heavy dark- \\ngreen \\n\\ncloth was drawn close about him, and in spite of the heat of the room he \\nwore a hood that overshadowed his face; but the gleam of his eyes could be \\nseen as he watched the hobbits. \\n\\n\\'Who is that?\\' Frodo asked, when he got a chance to whisper to Mr. \\nButterbur. \\'I don\\'t think you introduced him?\\' \\n\\n\\'Him?\\' said the landlord in an answering whisper, cocking an eye \\nwithout turning his head. \\'I don\\'t rightly know. He is one of the wandering \\nfolk -Rangers we call them. He seldom talks: not but what he can tell a rare \\ntale when he has the mind. He disappears for a month, or a year, and then he \\npops up again. He was in and out pretty often last spring; but I haven\\'t \\nseen him about lately. What his right name is I\\'ve never heard: but he\\'s \\nknown round here as Strider. Goes about at a great pace on his long shanks; \\nthough he don\\'t tell nobody what cause he has to hurry. But there\\'s no \\naccounting for East and West, as we say in Bree, meaning the Rangers and the \\nShire-folk, begging your pardon. Funny you should ask about him.\\' But at \\nthat moment Mr. Butterbur was called away by a demand for more ale and his \\nlast remark remained unexplained. \\n\\nFrodo found that Strider was now looking at him, as if he had heard or \\nguessed all that had been said. Presently, with a wave of his hand and a \\nnod, he invited Frodo to come over and sit by him. As Frodo drew near be \\nthrew back his hood, showing a shaggy head of dark hair necked with grey, \\nand in a pale stem face a pair of keen grey eyes. \\n\\n\\'I am called Strider,\\' he said in a low voice. \\'I am very pleased to \\nmeet you. Master - Underhill, if old Butterbur got your name right.\\' \\n\\n\\'He did,\\' said Frodo stiffly. He felt far from comfortable under the \\nstare of those keen eyes. \\n\\n\\'Well, Master Underhill,\\' said Strider, \\'if I were you, I should stop \\nyour young friends from talking too much. Drink, fire, and chance -meeting \\nare pleasant enough, but, well - this isn\\'t the Shire. There are queer folk \\nabout. Though I say it as shouldn\\'t, you may think,\\' he added with a wry \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsmile, seeing Frodo\\'s glance. \\'And there have been even stranger travellers \\nthrough Bree lately,\\' he went on, watching Frodo\\'s face. \\n\\nFrodo returned his gaze but said nothing; and Strider made no further \\nsign. His attention seemed suddenly to be fixed on Pippin. To his alarm \\nFrodo became aware that the ridiculous young Took, encouraged by his success \\nwith the fat Mayor of Michel Delving, was now actually giving a comic \\naccount of Bilbo\\'s farewell party. He was already giving an imitation of the \\nSpeech, and was drawing near to the astonishing Disappearance. \\n\\nFrodo was annoyed. It was a harmless enough tale for most of the local \\nhobbits, no doubt: just a funny story about those funny people away beyond \\nthe River; but some (old Butterbur, for instance) knew a thing or two, and \\nhad probably heard rumours long ago about Bilbo\\'s vanishing. It would bring \\nthe name of Baggins to their minds, especially if there had been inquiries \\nin Bree after that name. \\n\\nFrodo fidgeted, wondering what to do. Pippin was evidently much \\nenjoying the attention he was getting, and had become quite forgetful of \\ntheir danger. Frodo had a sudden fear that in his present mood he might even \\nmention the Ring; and that might well be disastrous. \\n\\n\\'You had better do something quick!\\' whispered Strider in his ear. \\n\\nFrodo jumped up and stood on a table, and began to talk. The attention \\nof Pippin\\'s audience was disturbed. Some of the hobbits looked at Frodo and \\nlaughed and clapped, thinking that Mr. Underhill had taken as much ale as \\nwas good for him. \\n\\nFrodo suddenly felt very foolish, and found himself (as was his habit \\nwhen making a speech) fingering the things in his pocket. He felt the Ring \\non its chain, and quite unaccountably the desire came over him to slip it on \\nand vanish out of the silly situation. It seemed to him, somehow, as if me \\nsuggestion came to him from outside, from someone or something a the room. \\nHe resisted the temptation firmly, and clasped the Ring in his hand, as if \\nto keep a hold on it and prevent it from escaping or doing any mischief. At \\nany rate it gave him no inspiration. He spoke \\'a few suitable words\\', as \\nthey would have said in the Shire: We are all very much gratified by the \\nkindness of your reception, and I venture to hope that my brief visit will \\nhelp to renew the old ties of friendship between the Shire and Bree; and \\nthen he hesitated and coughed. \\n\\nEveryone in the room was now looking at him. \\'A song!\\' shouted one of \\nthe hobbits. \\'A song! A song!\\' shouted all the others. \\'Come on now, master, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsing us something that we haven\\'t heard before!\\' \\n\\nFor a moment Frodo stood gaping. Then in desperation he began a \\nridiculous song that Bilbo had been rather fond of (and indeed rather proud \\nof, for he had made up the words himself). It was about an inn; and that is \\nprobably why it came into Frodo\\'s mind just then. Here it is in full. Only a \\nfew words of it are now, as a rule, remembered. \\n\\nThere is an inn, a merry old inn \\nbeneath an old grey hill, \\n\\nAnd there they brew a beer so brown \\nThat the Man in the Moon himself came down \\none night to drink his fill. \\n\\nThe ostler has a tipsy cat \\nthat plays a five-stringed fiddle; \\n\\nAnd up and down he runs his bow, \\n\\nNow squeaking high, now purring low, \\nnow sawing in the middle. \\n\\nThe landlord keeps a little dog \\nthat is mighty fond of jokes; \\n\\nWhen there\\'s good cheer among the guests, \\n\\nHe cocks an ear at all the jests \\nand laughs until he chokes. \\n\\nThey also keep a horned cow \\nas proud as any queen; \\n\\nBut music turns her head like ale, \\n\\nAnd makes her wave her tufted tail \\nand dance upon the green. \\n\\nAnd O! the rows of silver dishes \\nand the store of silver spoons! \\n\\nFor Sunday* there\\'s a special pair, \\n\\nAnd these they polish up with care \\non Saturday afternoons. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Man in the Moon was drinking deep, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand the cat began to wail; \\n\\nA dish and a spoon on the table danced, \\n\\nThe cow in the garden madly pranced, \\nand the little dog chased his tail. \\n\\nThe Man in the Moon took another mug, \\nand then rolled beneath his chair; \\n\\nAnd there he dozed and dreamed of ale, \\n\\nTill in the sky the stars were pale, \\nand dawn was in the air. \\n\\nThen the ostler said to his tipsy cat: \\n\\n\\'The white horses of the Moon, \\n\\nThey neigh and champ their silver bits; \\n\\nBut their master\\'s been and drowned his wits, \\nand the Sun\\'ll be rising soon!\\' \\n\\nSo the cat on his fiddle played hey-diddle-diddle, \\na jig that would wake the dead: \\n\\nHe squeaked and sawed and quickened the tune, \\nWhile the landlord shook the Man in the Moon: \\n\\'It\\'s after three!\\' he said. \\n\\nThey rolled the Man slowly up the hill \\nand bundled him into the Moon, \\n\\nWhile his horses galloped up in rear, \\n\\nAnd the cow came capering like a deer, \\nand a dish ran up with the spoon. \\n\\nNow quicker the fiddle went deedle-dum-diddle; \\nthe dog began to roar, \\n\\nThe cow and the horses stood on their heads; \\n\\nThe guests all bounded from their beds \\nand danced upon the floor. \\n\\nWith a ping and a pong the fiddle-strings broke! \\nthe cow jumped over the Moon, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd the little dog laughed to see such fun, \\n\\nAnd the Saturday dish went off at a run \\nwith the silver Sunday spoon. \\n\\nThe round Moon rolled behind the hill \\nas the Sun raised up her head. \\n\\nShe * hardly believed her fiery eyes; \\n\\nFor though it was day, to her surprise \\nthey all went back to bed! \\n\\nThere was loud and long applause. Frodo had a good voice, and the song \\ntickled their fancy. \\'Where\\'s old Barley?\\' they cried. \\'He ought to hear \\nthis. Bob ought to learn his cat the fiddle, and then we\\'d have a dance.\\' \\n\\nThey called for more ale, and began to shout: \\'Let\\'s have it again, master! \\nCome on now! Once more!\\' \\n\\nThey made Frodo have another drink, and then begin his song again, \\nwhile many of them joined in; for the tune was well known, and they were \\nquick at picking up words. It was now Frodo\\'s turn to feel pleased with \\nhimself. He capered about on the table; and when he came a second time to \\nthe cow jumped over the Moon, he leaped in the air. Much too vigorously; for \\nhe came down, bang, into a tray full of mugs, and slipped, and rolled off \\nthe table with a crash, clatter, and bump! The audience all opened their \\nmouths wide for laughter, and stopped short a gaping silence; for the singer \\ndisappeared. He simply vanished, as if he had gone slap through the floor \\nwithout leaving a hole ! \\n\\nThe local hobbits stared in amazement, and then sprang to their feet \\nand shouted for Barliman. All the company drew away from Pippin and Sam, \\nwho \\n\\nfound themselves left alone in a comer, and eyed darkly and doubtfully from \\na distance. It was plain that many people regarded them now as the \\ncompanions of a travelling magician of unknown powers and purpose. But \\nthere \\n\\nwas one swarthy Bree-lander, who stood looking at them with a knowing and \\nhalf-mocking expression that made them feel very uncomfortable. Presently he \\nslipped out of the door, followed by the squint-eyed southerner: the two had \\nbeen whispering together a good deal during the evening. Harry the \\ngatekeeper also went out just behind them.. \\n\\nFrodo felt a fool. Not knowing what else to do, he crawled away under \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe tables to the dark comer by Strider, who sat unmoved, giving no sign of \\nhis thoughts. Frodo leaned back against the wall and took off the Ring. How \\nit came to be on his finger he could not tell. He could only suppose that he \\nhad been handling it in his pocket while he sang, and that somehow it had \\nslipped on when he stuck out his hand with a jerk to save his fall. For a \\nmoment he wondered if the Ring itself had not played him a trick; perhaps it \\nhad tried to reveal itself in response to some wish or command that was felt \\nin the room. He did not like the looks of the men that had gone out. \\n\\n\\'Well?\\' said Strider, when he reappeared. \\'Why did you do that? Worse \\nthan anything your friends could have said! You have put your foot in it! Or \\nshould I say your finger?\\' \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know what you mean,\\' said Frodo, annoyed and alarmed. \\n\\n\\'Oh yes, you do,\\' answered Strider; \\'but we had better wait until the \\nuproar has died down. Then, if you please, Mr. Baggins, I should like a \\nquiet word with you.\\' \\n\\n\\'What about?\\' asked Frodo, ignoring the sudden use of his proper name. \\n\\n\\'A matter of some importance - to us both,\\' answered Strider, looking \\nFrodo in the eye. \\'You may hear something to your advantage.\\' \\n\\n\\'Very well,\\' said Frodo, trying to appear unconcerned. \\'I\\'ll talk to \\nyou later.\\' \\n\\nMeanwhile an argument was going on by the fireplace. Mr. Butterbur had \\ncome trotting in, and he was now trying to listen to several conflicting \\naccounts of the event at the same time. \\n\\n\\'I saw him, Mr. Butterbur,\\' said a hobbit; \\'or leastways I didn\\'t see \\nhim, if you take my meaning. He just vanished into thin air, in a manner of \\nspeaking.\\' \\n\\n\\'You don\\'t say, Mr. Mugwort!\\' said the landlord, looking puzzled. \\n\\n\\'Yes I do!\\' replied Mugwort. \\'And I mean what I say, what\\'s more.\\' \\n\\n\\'There\\'s some mistake somewhere,\\' said Butterbur, shaking his head. \\nThere was too much of that Mr. Underhill to go vanishing into thin air; or \\ninto thick air, as is more likely in this room.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, where is he now?\\' cried several voices. \\n\\n\\'How should I know? He\\'s welcome to go where he will, so long as he \\npays in the morning. There\\'s Mr. Took, now: he\\'s not vanished.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, I saw what I saw, and I saw what I didn\\'t,\\' said Mugwort \\nobstinately. \\n\\n\\'And I say there\\'s some mistake,\\' repeated Butterbur, picking up the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntray and gathering up the broken crockery. \\n\\n\\'Of course there\\'s a mistake!\\' said Frodo. \\'I haven\\'t vanished. Here I \\nam! I\\'ve just been having a few words with Strider in the comer.\\' \\n\\nHe came forward into the firelight; but most of the company backed \\naway,, even more perturbed than before. They were not in the least satisfied \\nby his explanation that he had crawled away quickly under the tables after \\nhe had fallen. Most of the Hobbits and the Men of Bree went off then and \\nthere in a huff, having no fancy for further entertainment that evening. One \\nor two gave Frodo a black look and departed muttering among themselves. \\n\\nThe \\n\\nDwarves and the two or three strange Men that still remained got up and said \\ngood night to the landlord, but not to Frodo and his friends. Before long no \\none was left but Strider, who sat on, unnoticed, by the wall. \\n\\nMr. Butterbur did not seem much put out. He reckoned, very probably, \\nthat his house would be full again on many future nights, until the present \\nmystery had been thoroughly discussed. \\'Now what have you been doing, Mr. \\nUnderhill?\\' he asked. \\'Frightening my customers and breaking up my crocks \\nwith your acrobatics!\\' \\n\\n\\'I am very sorry to have caused any trouble,\\' said Frodo. \\'It was quite \\nunintentional, I assure you. A most unfortunate accident.\\' \\n\\n\\'All right, Mr. Underhill! But if you\\'re going to do any more tumbling, \\nor conjuring, or whatever it was, you\\'d best warn folk beforehand - and warn \\nme. We\\'re a bit suspicious round here of anything out of the way -uncanny, \\nif you understand me; and we don\\'t take to it all of a sudden.\\' \\n\\n\\'I shan\\'t be doing anything of the sort again, Mr. Butterbur, I promise \\nyou. And now I think I\\'ll be getting to bed. We shall be making an early \\nstart. Will you see that our ponies are ready by eight o\\'clock?\\' \\n\\n\\'Very good! But before you go, I should like a word with you in \\nprivate, Mr. Underhill. Something has just come back to my mind that I ought \\nto tell you. I hope that you\\'ll not take it amiss. When I\\'ve seen to a thing \\nor two, I\\'ll come along to your room, if you\\'re willing.\\' \\n\\n\\'Certainly!\\' said Frodo; but his heart sank. He wondered how many \\nprivate talks he would have before he got to bed, and what they would \\nreveal. Were these people all in league against him? He began to suspect \\neven old Butterbur\\'s fat face of concealing dark designs. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 10. Strider \\n\\n\\n\\nFrodo, Pippin, and Sam made their way back to the parlour. There was no \\nlight. Merry was not there, and the fire had burned low. It was not until \\nthey had puffed up the embers into a blaze and thrown on a couple of faggots \\nthat they discovered Strider had come with them. There he was calmly sitting \\nin a chair by the door! \\n\\n\\'Hallo!\\' said Pippin. \\'Who are you, and what do you want?\\' \\n\\n\\'I am called Strider,\\' he answered: \\'and though he may have forgotten \\nit, your friend promised to have a quiet talk with me.\\' \\n\\n\\'You said I might hear something to my advantage, I believe,\\' said \\nFrodo. \\'What have you to say?\\' \\n\\n\\'Several things,\\' answered Strider. \\'But, of course, I have my price.\\' \\n\\n\\'What do you mean?\\' asked Frodo sharply. \\n\\n\\'Don\\'t be alarmed! I mean just this: I will tell you what I know, and \\ngive you some good advice - but I shall want a reward.\\' \\n\\n\\'And what will that be, pray?\\' said Frodo. He suspected now that he had \\nfallen in with a rascal, and he thought uncomfortably that he had brought \\nonly a little money with him. All of it would hardly satisfy a rogue, and he \\ncould not spare any of it. \\n\\n\\'No more than you can afford,\\' answered Strider with a slow smile, as \\nif he guessed Frodo\\'s thoughts. \\'Just this: you must take me along with you, \\nuntil I wish to leave you.\\' \\n\\n\\'Oh, indeed!\\' replied Frodo, surprised, but not much relieved. \\'Even if \\nI wanted another companion, I should not agree to any such thing, until I \\nknew a good deal more about you, and your business.\\' \\n\\n\\'Excellent!\\' exclaimed Strider, crossing his legs and sitting back \\ncomfortably. \\'You seem to be coming to your senses again, and that is all to \\nthe good. You have been much too careless so far. Very well! I will tell you \\nwhat I know, and leave the reward to you. You may be glad to grant it, when \\nyou have heard me.\\' \\n\\n\\'Go on then!\\' said Frodo. \\'What do you know?\\' \\n\\n\\'Too much; too many dark things,\\' said Strider grimly. \\'But as for your \\nbusiness -- \\' He got up and went to the door, opened it quickly and looked \\nout. Then he shut it quietly and sat down again. \\'I have quick ears,\\' he \\nwent on, lowering his voice, \\'and though I cannot disappear, I have hunted \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmany wild and wary things and I can usually avoid being seen, if I wish. \\nNow, I was behind the hedge this evening on the Road west of Bree, when four \\nhobbits came out of the Downlands. I need not repeat all that they said to \\nold Bombadil or to one another, but one thing interested me. Please \\nremember, said one of them, that the name Baggins must not be mentioned. I \\nam Mr. Underhill, if any name must be given. That interested me so much that \\nI followed them here. I slipped over the gate just behind them. Maybe Mr. \\nBaggins has an honest reason for leaving his name behind; but if so, I \\nshould advise him and his friends to be more careful.\\' \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t see what interest my name has for any one in Bree,\\' said Frodo \\nangrily, \\'and I have still to learn why it interests you. Mr. Strider may \\nhave an honest reason for spying and eavesdropping; but if so, I should \\nadvise him to explain it.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well answered!\\' said Strider laughing. \\'But the explanation is simple: \\n\\nI was looking for a Hobbit called Frodo Baggins. I wanted to find him \\nquickly. I had learned that he was carrying out of the Shire, well, a secret \\nthat concerned me and my friends. \\n\\n\\'Now, don\\'t mistake me!\\' he cried, as Frodo rose from his seat, and Sam \\njumped up with a scowl. \\'I shall take more care of the secret than you do. \\n\\nAnd care is needed!\\' He leaned forward and looked at them. \\'Watch every \\nshadow!\\' he said in a low voice. \\'Black horsemen have passed through Bree. \\nOn Monday one came down the Greenway, they say; and another appeared \\nlater, \\n\\ncoming up the Greenway from the south.\\' \\n\\nThere was a silence. At last Frodo spoke to Pippin and Sam: \\'I ought to \\nhave guessed it from the way the gatekeeper greeted us,\\' he said. \\'And the \\nlandlord seems to have heard something. Why did he press us to join the \\ncompany? And why on earth did we behave so foolishly: we ought to have \\nstayed quiet in here.\\' \\n\\n\\'It would have been better,\\' said Strider. \\'I would have stopped your \\ngoing into the common-room, if I could; but the innkeeper would not let me \\nin to see you, or take a message.\\' \\n\\n\\'Do you think he \\' began Frodo. \\n\\n\\'No, I don\\'t think any harm of old Butterbur. Only he does not \\naltogether like mysterious vagabonds of my sort.\\' Frodo gave him a puzzled \\nlook. \\'Well, I have rather a rascally look, have I not?\\' said Strider with a \\ncurl of his lip and a queer gleam in his eye. \\'But I hope we shall get to \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nknow one another better. When we do, I hope you will explain what happened \\nat the end of your song. For that little prank \\' \\n\\n\\'It was sheer accident!\\' interrupted Frodo. \\n\\n\\'I wonder,\\' said Strider. \\'Accident, then. That accident has made your \\nposition dangerous.\\' \\n\\n\\'Hardly more than it was already,\\' said Frodo. \\'I knew these horsemen \\nwere pursuing me; but now at any rate they seem to have missed me and to \\nhave gone away.\\' \\n\\n\\'You must not count on that!\\' said Strider sharply. \\'They will return. \\n\\nAnd more are coming. There are others. I know their number. I know these \\nRiders.\\' He paused, and his eyes were cold and hard. \\'And there are some \\nfolk in Bree who are not to be trusted,\\' he went on. \\'Bill Ferny, for \\ninstance. He has an evil name in the Bree-land, and queer folk call at his \\nhouse. You must have noticed him among the company: a swarthy sneering \\nfellow. He was very close with one of the Southern strangers, and they \\nslipped out together just after your \"accident\". Not all of those \\nSoutherners mean well; and as for Ferny, he would sell anything to anybody; \\nor make mischief for amusement.\\' \\n\\n\\'What will Ferny sell, and what has my accident got to do with him?\\' \\nsaid Frodo, still determined not to understand Strider\\'s hints. \\n\\n\\'News of you, of course,\\' answered Strider. \\'An account of your \\nperformance would be very interesting to certain people. After that they \\nwould hardly need to be told your real name. It seems to me only too likely \\nthat they will hear of it before this night is over. Is that enough? You can \\ndo as you like about my reward: take me as a guide or not. But I may say \\nthat I know all the lands between the Shire and the Misty Mountains, for I \\nhave wandered over them for many years. I am older than I look. I might \\nprove useful. You will have to leave the open road after tonight; for the \\nhorsemen will watch it night and day. You may escape from Bree, and be \\nallowed to go forward while the Sun is up; but you won\\'t go far. They will \\ncome on you in the wild, in some dark place where there is no help. Do you \\nwish them to find you? They are terrible!\\' \\n\\nThe hobbits looked at him, and saw with surprise that his face was \\ndrawn as if with pain, and his hands clenched the arms of his chair. The \\nroom was very quiet and still, and the light seemed to have grown dim. For a \\nwhile he sat with unseeing eyes as if walking in distant memory or listening \\nto sounds in the Night far away. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'There!\\' he cried after a moment, drawing his hand across his brow. \\n\\'Perhaps I know more about these pursuers than you do. You fear them, but \\nyou do not fear them enough, yet. Tomorrow you will have to escape, if you \\ncan. Strider can take you by paths that are seldom trodden. Will you have \\nhim?\\' \\n\\nThere was a heavy silence. Frodo made no answer, his mind was confused \\nwith doubt and fear. Sam frowned, and looked at his master; and at last he \\nbroke out: \\n\\n\\'With your leave, Mr. Frodo, I\\'d say no! This Strider here, he warns \\nand he says take care; and I say yes to that, and let\\'s begin with him. He \\ncomes out of the Wild, and I never heard no good of such folk. He knows \\nsomething, that\\'s plain, and more than I like; but it\\'s no reason why we \\nshould let him go leading us out into some dark place far from help, as he \\nputs it.\\' \\n\\nPippin fidgeted and looked uncomfortable. Strider did not reply to Sam, \\nbut turned his keen eyes on Frodo. Frodo caught his glance and looked away. \\n\\'No,\\' he said slowly. \\'I don\\'t agree. I think, I think you are not really as \\nyou choose to look. You began to talk to me like the Bree-folk, but your \\nvoice has changed. Still Sam seems right in this: I don\\'t see why you should \\nwarn us to take care, and yet ask us to take you on trust. Why the disguise? \\nWho are you? What do you really know about - about my business; and how \\ndo \\n\\nyou know it?\\' \\n\\n\\'The lesson in caution has been well learned,\\' said Strider with a grim \\nsmile. \\'But caution is one thing and wavering is another. You will never get \\nto Rivendell now on your own, and to trust me is your only chance. You must \\nmake up your mind. I will answer some of your questions, if that will help \\nyou to do so. But why should you believe my story, if you do not trust me \\nalready? Still here it is \\' \\n\\nAt that moment there came a knock at the door. Mr. Butterbur had \\narrived with candles, and behind him was Nob with cans of hot water. Strider \\nwithdrew into a dark corner. \\n\\n\\'I\\'ve come to bid you good night,\\' said the landlord, putting the \\ncandles on the table. \\'Nob! Take the water to the rooms!\\' He came in and \\nshut the door. \\n\\n\\'It\\'s like this,\\' he began, hesitating and looking troubled. \\'If I\\'ve \\ndone any harm, I\\'m sorry indeed. But one thing drives out another, as you\\'ll \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nadmit; and I\\'m a busy man. But first one thing and then another this week \\nhave jogged my memory, as the saying goes; and not too late I hope. You see, \\nI was asked to look out for hobbits of the Shire, and for one by the name of \\nBaggins in particular.\\' \\n\\n\\'And what has that got to do with me?\\' asked Frodo. \\n\\n\\'Ah! you know best,\\' said the landlord, knowingly. \\'I won\\'t give you \\naway; but I was told that this Baggins would be going by the name of \\nUnderhill, and I was given a description that fits you well enough, if I may \\nsay so.\\' \\n\\n\\'Indeed! Let\\'s have it then!\\' said Frodo, unwisely interrupting. \\n\\n\\'A stout little fellow with red cheeks, \\' said Mr. Butterbur solemnly. \\n\\nPippin chuckled, but Sam looked indignant. \\'That won\\'t help you much; it \\ngoes for most hobbits. Barley, he says to me,\\' continued Mr. Butterbur with \\na glance at Pippin. \\'But this one is taller than some and fairer than most, \\nand he has a cleft in his chin: perky chap with a bright eye. Begging your \\npardon, but he said it, not me.\\' \\n\\n\\'He said it? And who was he?\\' asked Frodo eagerly. \\n\\n\\'Ah! That was Gandalf, if you know who I mean. A wizard they say he is, \\nbut he\\'s a good friend of mine, whether or no. But now I don\\'t know what \\nhe\\'ll have to say to me, if I see him again: turn all my ale sour or me into \\na block of wood, I shouldn\\'t wonder. He\\'s a bit hasty. Still what\\'s done \\ncan\\'t be undone. \\' \\n\\n\\'Well, what have you done?\\' said Frodo, getting impatient with the slow \\nunravelling of Butterbur\\'s thoughts. \\n\\n\\'Where was I?\\' said the landlord, pausing and snapping his fingers. \\n\\n\\'Ah, yes ! Old Gandalf. Three months back he walked right into my room \\nwithout a knock. Barley, he says, I\\'m off in the morning. Will you do \\nsomething for me? You\\'ve only to name it, I said. I\\'m in a hurry, said he, \\nand I\\'ve no time myself, but I want a message took to the Shire. Have you \\nanyone you can send, and trust to go? I can find someone, I said, tomorrow, \\nmaybe, or the day after. Make it tomorrow, he says, and then he gave me a \\nletter. \\n\\n\\'It\\'s addressed plain enough,\\' said Mr. Butterbur, producing a letter \\nfrom his pocket, and reading out the address slowly and proudly (he valued \\nhis reputation as a lettered man): \\n\\nMr FRODO BAGGINS, BAG END, HOBBITON in the SHIRE. \\n\\n\\'A letter for me from Gandalf!\\' cried Frodo. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Ah!\\' said Mr. Butterbur. \\'Then your right name is Baggins?\\' \\n\\n\\'It is,\\' said Frodo, \\'and you had better give me that letter at once, \\nand explain why you never sent it. That\\'s what you came to tell me, I \\nsuppose, though you\\'ve taken a long time to come to the point.\\' \\n\\nPoor Mr. Butterbur looked troubled. \\'You\\'re right, master,\\' he said, \\n\\n\\'and I beg your pardon. And I\\'m mortal afraid of what Gandalf will say, if \\nharm comes of it. But I didn\\'t keep it back a-purpose. I put it by safe. \\n\\nThen I couldn\\'t find nobody willing to go to the Shire next day, nor the day \\nafter, and none of my own folk were to spare; and then one thing after \\nanother drove it out of my mind. I\\'m a busy man. I\\'ll do what I can to set \\nmatters right, and if there\\'s any help I can give, you\\'ve only to name it. \\n\\n\\'Leaving the letter aside, I promised Gandalf no less. Barley, he says \\nto me, this friend of mine from the Shire, he may be coming out this way \\nbefore long, him and another. He\\'ll be calling himself Underhill. Mind that! \\nBut you need ask no questions. And if I\\'m not with him, he may be in \\ntrouble, and he may need help. Do whatever you can for him, and I\\'ll be \\ngrateful, he says. And here you are, and trouble is not far off, seemingly.\\' \\n\\n\\'What do you mean?\\' asked Frodo. \\n\\n\\'These black men,\\' said the landlord lowering his voice. \\'They\\'re \\nlooking for Baggins, and if they mean well, then I\\'m a hobbit. It was on \\nMonday, and all the dogs were yammering and the geese screaming. Uncanny, \\n\\nI \\n\\ncalled it. Nob, he came and told me that two black men were at the door \\nasking for a hobbit called Baggins. Nob\\'s hair was all stood on end. I bid \\nthe black fellows be off, and slammed the door on them; but they\\'ve been \\nasking the same question all the way to Archet, I hear. And that Ranger, \\nStrider, he\\'s been asking questions, too. Tried to get in here to see you, \\nbefore you\\'d had bite or sup, he did.\\' \\n\\n\\'Fie did!\\' said Strider suddenly, coming forward into the light. \\'And \\nmuch trouble would have been saved, if you had let him in, Barliman.\\' \\n\\nThe landlord jumped with surprise. \\'You!\\' he cried. \\'You\\'re always \\npopping up. What do you want now?\\' \\n\\n\\'He\\'s here with my leave,\\' said Frodo. \\'He came to offer me his help.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, you know your own business, maybe,\\' said Mr. Butterbur, looking \\nsuspiciously at Strider. \\'But if I was in your plight, I wouldn\\'t take up \\nwith a Ranger.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then who would you take up with?\\' asked Strider. \\'A fat innkeeper who \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nonly remembers his own name because people shout it at him all day? They \\ncannot stay in The Pony for ever, and they cannot go home. They have a long \\nroad before them. Will you go with them and keep the black men off?\\' \\n\\n\\'Me? Leave Bree! I wouldn\\'t do that for any money,\\' said Mr. Butterbur, \\nlooking really scared. \\'But why can\\'t you stay here quiet for a bit, Mr. \\nUnderhill? What are all these queer goings on? What are these black men \\nafter, and where do they come from, I\\'d like to know?\\' \\n\\n\\'I\\'m sorry I can\\'t explain it all,\\' answered Frodo. \\'I am tired and \\nvery worried, and it\\'s a long tale. But if you mean to help me, I ought to \\nwarn you that you will be in danger as long as I am in your house. These \\nBlack Riders: I am not sure, but I think, I fear they come from \\' \\n\\n\\'They come from Mordor,\\' said Strider in a low voice. \\'From Mordor, \\nBarliman, if that means anything to you.\\' \\n\\n\\'Save us!\\' cried Mr. Butterbur turning pale; the name evidently was \\nknown to him. \\'That is the worst news that has come to Bree in my time.\\' \\'It \\nis,\\' said Frodo. \\'Are you still willing to help me?\\' \\'I am,\\' said Mr. \\n\\nButterbur. \\'More than ever. Though I don\\'t know what the likes of me can do \\nagainst, against \\' he faltered. \\n\\n\\'Against the Shadow in the East,\\' said Strider quietly. \\'Not much, \\nBarliman, but every little helps. You can let Mr. Underhill stay here \\ntonight, as Mr. Underhill, and you can forget the name of Baggins, till he \\nis far away.\\' \\n\\n\\'I\\'ll do that,\\' said Butterbur. \\'But they\\'ll find out he\\'s here without \\nhelp from me, I\\'m afraid. It\\'s a pity Mr. Baggins drew attention to himself \\nthis evening, to say no more. The story of that Mr. Bilbo\\'s going off has \\nbeen heard before tonight in Bree. Even our Nob has been doing some guessing \\nin his slow pate: and there are others in Bree quicker in the uptake than he \\nis.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, we can only hope the Riders won\\'t come back yet,\\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'I hope not, indeed,\\' said Butterbur. \\'But spooks or no spooks, they \\nwon\\'t get in The Pony so easy. Don\\'t you worry till the morning. Nob\\'ll say \\nno word. No black man shall pass my doors, while I can stand on my legs. Me \\nand my folk\\'ll keep watch tonight; but you had best get some sleep, if you \\ncan.\\' \\n\\n\\'In any case we must be called at dawn,\\' said Frodo. \\'We must get off \\nas early as possible. Breakfast at six-thirty, please.\\' \\n\\n\\'Right! I\\'ll see to the orders,\\' said the landlord. \\'Good night, Mr. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBaggins - Underhill, I should say! Good night - now, bless me! Where\\'s your \\nMr. Brandybuck?\\' \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know,\\' said Frodo with sudden anxiety. They had forgotten all \\nabout Merry, and it was getting late. \\'I am afraid he is out. He said \\nsomething about going for a breath of air.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, you do want looking after and no mistake: your party might be on \\na holiday!\\' said Butterbur. \\'I must go and bar the doors quick, but I\\'ll see \\nyour friend is let in when he comes. I\\'d better send Nob to look for him. \\nGood night to you all!\\' At last Mr. Butterbur went out, with another \\ndoubtful look at Strider and a shake of his head. His footsteps retreated \\ndown the passage. \\n\\n\\'Well?\\' said Strider. \\'When are you going to open that letter?\\' Frodo \\nlooked carefully at the seal before he broke it. It seemed certainly to be \\nGandalf s. Inside, written in the wizard\\'s strong but graceful script, was \\nthe following message: \\n\\nTHE PRANCING PONY, BREE. Midyear\\'s Day, Shire Year, 1418. \\n\\nDear Frodo, \\n\\nBad news has reached me here. I must go off at once. You had better \\nleave Bag End soon, and get out of the Shire before the end of July at \\nlatest. I will return as soon as I can; and I will follow you, if I find \\nthat you are gone. Leave a message for me here, if you pass through Bree. \\nYou can trust the landlord (Butterbur). You may meet a friend of mine on the \\nRoad: a Man, lean, dark, tall, by some called Strider. He knows our business \\nand will help you. Make for Rivendell. There I hope we may meet again. If I \\ndo not come, Elrond will advise you. \\n\\nYours in haste \\n\\nGANDALF. \\n\\nPS. Do NOT use It again, not far any reason whatever! Do not travel by \\nnight! \\n\\nPPS. Make sure that it is the real Strider. There are many strange men \\non the roads. His true name is Aragorn. \\n\\nAll that is gold does not glitter, \\n\\nNot all those who wander are lost; \\n\\nThe old that is strong does not wither, \\n\\nDeep roots are not reached by the frost. \\n\\nFrom the ashes a fire shall be woken, \\n\\nA light from the shadows shall spring; \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRenewed shall be blade that was broken, \\nThe crownless again shall be king. \\n\\n\\n\\nPPPS. I hope Butterbur sends this promptly. A worthy man, but his \\nmemory is like a lumber-roam: thing wanted always buried. If he forgets, I \\nshall roast him. \\n\\nFare Well 7 \\n\\nFrodo read the letter to himself, and then passed it to Pippin and Sam. \\n\\'Really old Butterbur has made a mess of things!\\' he said. \\'He deserves \\nroasting. If I had got this at once, we might all have been safe in \\nRivendell by now. But what can have happened to Gandalf? He writes as if he \\nwas going into great danger.\\' \\n\\n\\'He has been doing that for many years,\\' said Strider. \\n\\nFrodo turned and looked at him thoughtfully, wondering about Gandalf s \\nsecond postscript. \\'Why didn\\'t you tell me that you were Gandalf s friend at \\nonce?\\' he asked. \\'It would have saved time.\\' \\n\\n\\'Would it? Would any of you have believed me till now?\\' said Strider. \\n\\n\\'I knew nothing of this letter. For all I knew I had to persuade you to \\ntrust me without proofs, if I was to help you. In any case, I did not intend \\nto tell you all about myself at once. I had to study you first, and make \\nsure of you. The Enemy has set traps for me before now. As soon as I had \\nmade up my mind, I was ready to tell you whatever you asked. But I must \\nadmit,\\' he added with a queer laugh, \\'that I hoped you would take to me for \\nmy own sake. A hunted man sometimes wearies of distrust and longs for \\nfriendship. But there, I believe my looks are against me.\\' \\n\\n\\'They are - at first sight at any rate,\\' laughed Pippin with sudden \\nrelief after reading Gandalf\\'s letter. \\'But handsome is as handsome does, as \\nwe say in the Shire; and I daresay we shall all look much the same after \\nlying for days in hedges and ditches.\\' \\n\\n\\'It would take more than a few days, or weeks, or years, of wandering \\nin the Wild to make you look like Strider,\\' he answered. \\'And you would die \\nfirst, unless you are made of sterner stuff than you look to be.\\' \\n\\nPippin subsided; but Sam was not daunted, and he still eyed Strider \\ndubiously. \\'How do we know you are the Strider that Gandalf speaks about?\\' \\nhe demanded. \\'You never mentioned Gandalf, till this letter came out. You \\nmight be a play-acting spy, for all I can see, trying to get us to go with \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyou. You might have done in the real Strider and took his clothes. What have \\nyou to say to that?\\' \\n\\n\\'That you are a stout fellow,\\' answered Strider; \\'but I am afraid my \\nonly answer to you, Sam Gamgee, is this. If I had killed the real Strider, I \\ncould kill you. And I should have killed you already without so much talk. \\n\\nIf I was after the Ring, I could have it - NOW!\\' \\n\\nHe stood up, and seemed suddenly to grow taller. In his eyes gleamed a \\nlight, keen and commanding. Throwing back his cloak, he laid his hand on the \\nhilt of a sword that had hung concealed by his side. They did not dare to \\nmove. Sam sat wide-mouthed staring at him dumbly. \\n\\n\\'But I am the real Strider, fortunately,\\' he said, looking down at them \\nwith his face softened by a sudden smile. \\'I am Aragorn son of Arathorn; and \\nif by life or death I can save you, I will.\\' \\n\\nThere was a long silence. At last Frodo spoke with hesitation. \\'I \\nbelieved that you were a friend before the letter came,\\' he said, \\'or at \\nleast I wished to. You have frightened me several times tonight, but never \\nin the way that servants of the Enemy would, or so I imagine. I think one of \\nhis spies would - well, seem fairer and feel fouler, if you understand.\\' \\n\\n\\'I see,\\' laughed Strider. \\'I look foul and feel fair. Is that it? All \\nthat is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost \\' \\n\\n\\'Did the verses apply to you then?\\' asked Frodo. \\'I could not make out \\nwhat they were about. But how did you know that they were in Gandalf s \\nletter, if you have never seen it?\\' \\n\\n\\'I did not know,\\' he answered. \\'But I am Aragorn, and those verses go \\nwith that name.\\' He drew out his sword, and they saw that the blade was \\nindeed broken a foot below the hilt. \\'Not much use is it, Sam?\\' said \\nStrider. \\'But the time is near when it shall be forged anew.\\' \\n\\nSam said nothing. \\n\\n\\'Well,\\' said Strider, \\'with Sam\\'s permission we will call that settled. \\n\\nStrider shall be your guide. We shall have a rough road tomorrow. Even if we \\nare allowed to leave Bree unhindered, we can hardly hope now to leave it \\nunnoticed. But I shall try to get lost as soon as possible. I know one or \\ntwo ways out of Bree-land other than the main road. If once we shake off the \\npursuit, I shall make for Weathertop.\\' \\n\\n\\'Weathertop?\\' said Sam. \\'What\\'s that?\\' \\n\\n\\'It is a hill, just to the north of the Road, about half way from here \\nto Rivendell. It commands a wide view all round; and there we shall have a \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchance to look about us. Gandalf will make for that point, if he follows us. \\nAfter Weathertop our journey will become more difficult, and we shall have \\nto choose between various dangers.\\' \\n\\n\\'When did you last see Gandalf?\\' asked Frodo. \\'Do you know where he is, \\nor what he is doing?\\' \\n\\nStrider looked grave. \\'I do not know,\\' he said. \\'I came west with him \\nin the spring. I have often kept watch on the borders of the Shire in the \\nlast few years, when he was busy elsewhere. He seldom left it unguarded. We \\nlast met on the first of May: at Sam Ford down the Brandywine. He told me \\nthat his business with you had gone well, and that you would be starting for \\nRivendell in the last week of September. As I knew he was at your side, I \\nwent away on a journey of my own. And that has proved ill; for plainly some \\nnews reached him, and I was not at hand to help. \\n\\n\\'I am troubled, for the first time since I have known him. We should \\nhave had messages, even if he could not come himself. When I returned, many \\ndays ago, I heard the ill news. The tidings had gone far and wide that \\nGandalf was missing and the horsemen had been seen. It was the Elven-folk of \\nGildor that told me this; and later they told me that you had left your \\nhome; but there was no news of your leaving Buckland. I have been watching \\nthe East Road anxiously.\\' \\n\\n\\'Do you think the Black Riders have anything to do with it - with \\nGandalf\\'s absence, I mean?\\' asked Frodo. \\n\\n\\'I do not know of anything else that could have hindered him, except \\nthe Enemy himself,\\' said Strider. \\'But do not give up hope ! Gandalf is \\ngreater than you Shire-folk know - as a rule you can only see his jokes and \\ntoys. But this business of ours will be his greatest task.\\' \\n\\nPippin yawned. \\'I am sorry,\\' he said, \\'but I am dead tired. In spite of \\nall the danger and worry I must go to bed, or sleep where I sit. Where is \\nthat silly fellow, Merry? It would be the last straw, if we had to go out in \\nthe dark to look for him.\\' \\n\\nAt that moment they heard a door slam; then feet came running along the \\npassage. Merry came in with a rush followed by Nob. He shut the door \\nhastily, and leaned against it. He was out of breath. They stared at him in \\nalarm for a moment before he gasped: \\'I have seen them, Frodo! I have seen \\nthem! Black Riders!\\' \\n\\n\\'Black Riders!\\' cried Frodo. \\'Where?\\' \\n\\n\\'Here. In the village. I stayed indoors for an hour. Then as you did \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnot come back, I went out for a stroll. I had come back again and was \\nstanding just outside the light of the lamp looking at the stars. Suddenly I \\nshivered and felt that something horrible was creeping near: there was a son \\nof deeper shade among the shadows across the road, just beyond the edge of \\nthe lamplight. It slid away at once into the dark without a sound. There was \\nno horse.\\' \\n\\n\\'Which way did it go?\\' asked Strider, suddenly and sharply. Merry \\nstarted, noticing the stranger for the first time. \\'Go on!\\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'This is a friend of Gandalf\\'s. I will explain later.\\' \\n\\n\\'It seemed to make off up the Road, eastward,\\' continued Merry. \\'I \\ntried to follow. Of course, it vanished almost at once; but I went round the \\ncorner and on as far as the last house on the Road.\\' \\n\\nStrider looked at Merry with wonder. \\'You have a stout heart,\\' he said; \\n\\n\\'but it was foolish.\\' \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know,\\' said Merry. \\'Neither brave nor silly, I think. I could \\nhardly help myself. I seemed to be drawn somehow. Anyway, I went, and \\nsuddenly I heard voices by the hedge. One was muttering; and the other was \\nwhispering, or hissing. I couldn\\'t hear a word that was said. I did not \\ncreep any closer, because I began to tremble all over. Then I felt \\nterrified, and I turned back, and was just going to bolt home, when \\nsomething came behind me and I... I fell over.\\' \\n\\n\\'I found him, sir,\\' put in Nob. \\'Mr. Butterbur sent me out with a \\nlantern. I went down to West-gate, and then back up towards South-gate. Just \\nnigh Bill Ferny\\'s house I thought I could see something in the Road. I \\ncouldn\\'t swear to it, but it looked to me as if two men was stooping over \\nsomething, lilting it. I gave a shout, but where I got up to the spot there \\nwas no signs of them, and only Mr. Brandybuck lying by the roadside. He \\nseemed to be asleep. \"I thought I had fallen into deep water,\" he says to \\nme, when I shook him. Very queer he was, and as soon as I had roused him, he \\ngot up and ran back here like a hare.\\' \\n\\n\\'I am afraid that\\'s true,\\' said Merry, \\'though I don\\'t know what I \\nsaid. I had an ugly dream, which I can\\'t remember. I went to pieces. I don\\'t \\nknow what came over me.\\' \\n\\n\\'I do,\\' said Strider. \\'The Black Breath. The Riders must have left \\ntheir horses outside, and passed back through the South-gate in secret. They \\nwill know all the news now, for they have visited Bill Ferny; and probably \\nthat Southerner was a spy as well. Something may happen in the night, before \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwe leave Bree.\\' \\n\\n\\'What will happen?\\' said Merry. \\'Will they attack the inn?\\' \\'No, I \\nthink not,\\' said Strider. \\'They are not all here yet. And in any case that \\nis not their way. In dark and loneliness they are strongest; they will not \\nopenly attack a house where there are lights and many people -not until they \\nare desperate, not while all the long leagues of Eriador still lie before \\nus. But their power is in terror, and already some in Bree are in their \\nclutch. They will drive these wretches to some evil work: Ferny, and some of \\nthe strangers, and, maybe, the gatekeeper too. They had words with Harry at \\nWest-gate on Monday. I was watching them. He was white and shaking when \\nthey \\n\\nleft him.\\' \\n\\n\\'We seem to have enemies all round,\\' said Frodo. \\'What are we to do?\\' \\n\\n\\'Stay here, and do not go to your rooms ! They are sure to have found \\nout which those are. The hobbit-rooms have windows looking north and close \\nto the ground. We will all remain together and bar this window and the door. \\nBut first Nob and I will fetch your luggage.\\' \\n\\nWhile Strider was gone, Frodo gave Merry a rapid account of all that \\nhad happened since supper. Merry was still reading and pondering Gandalf\\'s \\nletter when Strider and Nob returned. \\n\\n\\'Well Masters,\\' said Nob, \\'I\\'ve ruffled up the clothes and put in a \\nbolster down the middle of each bed. And I made a nice imitation of your \\nhead with a brown woollen mat, Mr. Bag - Underhill, sir,\\' he added with a \\ngrin. \\n\\nPippin laughed. \\'Very life-like!\\' he said. \\'But what will happen when \\nthey have penetrated the disguise?\\' \\n\\n\\'We shall see,\\' said Strider. \\'Fet us hope to hold the fort till \\nmorning.\\' \\n\\n\\'Good night to you,\\' said Nob, and went off to take his part in the \\nwatch on the doors. \\n\\nTheir bags and gear they piled on the parlour-floor. They pushed a low \\nchair against the door and shut the window. Peering out, Frodo saw that the \\nnight was still clear. The Sickle was swinging bright above the shoulders of \\nBree-hill. He then closed and barred the heavy inside shutters and drew the \\ncurtains together. Strider built up the fire and blew out all the candles. \\n\\nThe hobbits lay down on their blankets with their feet towards the \\nhearth; but Strider settled himself in the chair against the door. They \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntalked for a little, for Merry still had several questions to ask. \\n\\n\\'Jumped over the Moon!\\' chuckled Merry as he rolled himself in his \\nblanket. \\'Very ridiculous of you, Frodo! But I wish I had been there to see. \\nThe worthies of Bree will be discussing it a hundred years hence.\\' \\n\\n\\'I hope so,\\' said Strider. Then they all fell silent, and one by one \\nthe hobbits dropped off to sleep. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 11. A Knife in the Dark \\n\\n\\n\\nAs they prepared for sleep in the inn at Bree, darkness lay on \\nBuckland; a mist strayed in the dells and along the river -bank. The house at \\nCrickhollow stood silent. Fatty Bolger opened the door cautiously and peered \\nout. A feeling of fear had been growing on him all day, and he was unable to \\nrest or go to bed: there was a brooding threat in the breathless night-air. \\n\\nAs he stared out into the gloom, a black shadow moved under the trees; the \\ngate seemed to open of its own accord and close again without a sound. \\nTerror seized him. He shrank back, and for a moment he stood trembling in \\nthe hall. Then he shut and locked the door. \\n\\nThe night deepened. There came the soft sound of horses led with \\nstealth along the lane. Outside the gate they stopped, and three black \\nfigures entered, like shades of night creeping across the ground. One went \\nto the door, one to the corner of the house on either side; and there they \\nstood, as still as the shadows of stones, while night went slowly on. The \\nhouse and the quiet trees seemed to be waiting breathlessly. \\n\\nThere was a faint stir in the leaves, and a cock crowed far away. The \\ncold hour before dawn was passing. The figure by the door moved. In the dark \\nwithout moon or stars a drawn blade gleamed, as if a chill light had been \\nunsheathed. There was a blow, soft but heavy, and the door shuddered. \\n\\n\\'Open, in the name of Mordor!\\' said a voice thin and menacing. \\n\\nAt a second blow the door yielded and fell back, with timbers burst and \\nlock broken. The black figures passed swiftly in. \\n\\nAt that moment, among the trees nearby, a horn rang out. It rent the \\nnight like fire on a hill -top. \\n\\nAWAKE! FEAR! FIRE! FOES! AWAKE! \\n\\nFatty Bolger had not been idle. As soon as he saw the dark shapes creep \\nfrom the garden, he knew that he must run for it, or perish. And run he did, \\nout of the back door, through the garden, and over the fields. When he \\nreached the nearest house, more than a mile away, he collapsed on the \\ndoorstep. \\'No, no, no!\\' he was crying. \\'No, not me! I haven\\'t got it!\\' It \\nwas some time before anyone could make out what he was babbling about. \\nAt \\n\\nlast they got the idea that enemies were in Buckland, some strange invasion \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfrom the Old Forest. And then they lost no more time. \\n\\nFEAR! FIRE! FOES! \\n\\nThe Brandybucks were blowing the Horn-call of Buckland, that had not \\nbeen sounded for a hundred years, not since the white wolves came in the \\nFell Winter, when the Brandywine was frozen over. \\n\\nAWAKE! AWAKE! \\n\\nFar-away answering horns were heard. The alarm was spreading. The black \\nfigures fled from the house. One of them let fall a hobbit-cloak on the \\nstep, as he ran. In the lane the noise of hoofs broke out, and gathering to \\na gallop, went hammering away into the darkness. All about Crickhollow there \\nwas the sound of horns blowing, and voices crying and feet running. But the \\nBlack Riders rode like a gale to the North-gate. Let the little people blow! \\nSauron would deal with them later. Meanwhile they had another errand: they \\nknew now that the house was empty and the Ring had gone. They rode down \\nthe \\n\\nguards at the gate and vanished from the Shire. \\n\\nIn the early night Frodo woke from deep sleep, suddenly, as if some \\nsound or presence had disturbed him. He saw that Strider was sitting alert \\nin his chair: his eyes gleamed in the light of the fire, which had been \\ntended and was burning brightly; but he made no sign or movement. \\n\\nFrodo soon went to sleep again; but his dreams were again troubled with \\nthe noise of wind and of galloping hoofs. The wind seemed to be curling \\nround the house and shaking it; and far off he heard a horn blowing wildly. \\n\\nHe opened his eyes, and heard a cock crowing lustily in the inn-yard. \\nStrider had drawn the curtains and pushed back the shutters with a clang. \\n\\nThe first grey light of day was in the room, and a cold air was coming \\nthrough the open window. \\n\\nAs soon as Strider had roused them all, he led the way to their \\nbedrooms. When they saw them they were glad that they had taken his advice: \\nthe windows had been forced open and were swinging, and the curtains were \\nflapping; the beds were tossed about, and the bolsters slashed and flung \\nupon the floor; the brown mat was torn to pieces. \\n\\nStrider immediately went to fetch the landlord. Poor Mr. Butterbur \\nlooked sleepy and frightened. He had hardly closed his eyes all night (so he \\nsaid), but he had never heard a sound. \\n\\n\\'Never has such a thing happened in my time!\\' he cried, raising his \\nhands in horror. \\'Guests unable to sleep in their beds, and good bolsters \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nruined and all! What are we coming to?\\' \\n\\n\\'Dark times,\\' said Strider. \\'But for the present you may be left in \\npeace, when you have got rid of us. We will leave at once. Never mind about \\nbreakfast: a drink and a bite standing will have to do. We shall be packed \\nin a few minutes.\\' \\n\\nMr. Butterbur hurried off to see that their ponies were got ready, and \\nto fetch them a \\'bite\\'. But very soon he came back in dismay. The ponies had \\nvanished! The stable-doors had all been opened in the night, and they were \\ngone: not only Merry\\'s ponies, but every other horse and beast in the place. \\n\\nFrodo was crushed by the news. How could they hope to reach Rivendell \\non foot, pursued by mounted enemies? They might as well set out for the \\nMoon. Strider sat silent for a while, looking at the hobbits, as if he was \\nweighing up their strength and courage. \\n\\n\\'Ponies would not help us to escape horsemen,\\' he said at last, \\nthoughtfully, as if he guessed what Frodo had in mind. \\'We should not go \\nmuch slower on foot, not on the roads that I mean to take. I was going to \\nwalk in any case. It is the food and stores that trouble me. We cannot count \\non getting anything to eat between here and Rivendell, except what we take \\nwith us; and we ought to take plenty to spare; for we may be delayed, or \\nforced to go round-about, far out of the direct way. How much are you \\nprepared to carry on your backs?\\' \\n\\n\\'As much as we must,\\' said Pippin with a sinking heart, but trying to \\nshow that he was tougher than he looked (or felt). \\n\\n\\'I can carry enough for two,\\' said Sam defiantly. \\n\\n\\'Can\\'t anything be done, Mr. Butterbur?\\' asked Frodo. \\'Can\\'t we get a \\ncouple of ponies in the village, or even one just for the baggage? I don\\'t \\nsuppose we could hire them, but we might be able to buy them,\\' he added, \\ndoubtfully, wondering if he could afford it. \\n\\n\\'I doubt it,\\' said the landlord unhappily. \\'The two or three \\nriding-ponies that there were in Bree were stabled in my yard, and they\\'re \\ngone. As for other animals, horses or ponies for draught or what not, there \\nare very few of them in Bree, and they won\\'t be for sale. But I\\'ll do what I \\ncan. I\\'ll rout out Bob and send him round as soon as may be.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Strider reluctantly, \\'you had better do that. I am afraid \\nwe shall have to try to get one pony at least. But so ends all hope of \\nstarting early, and slipping away quietly! We might as well have blown a \\nhorn to announce our departure. That was part of their plan, no doubt.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'There is one crumb of comfort,\\' said Merry, \\'and more than a crumb, I \\nhope: we can have breakfast while we wait - and sit down to it. Let\\'s get \\nhold of Nob!\\' \\n\\nIn the end there was more than three hours\\' delay. Bob came back with \\nthe report that no horse or pony was to be got for love or money in the \\nneighbourhood - except one: Bill Ferny had one that he might possibly sell. \\n\\n\\'A poor old half-starved creature it is,\\' said Bob; \\'but he won\\'t part with \\nit for less than thrice its worth, seeing how you\\'re placed, not if I knows \\nBill Ferny.\\' \\n\\n\\'Bill Ferny?\\' said Frodo. \\'Isn\\'t there some trick? Wouldn\\'t the beast \\nbolt back to him with all our stuff, or help in tracking us, or something?\\' \\n\\n\\'I wonder,\\' said Strider. \\'But I cannot imagine any animal running home \\nto him, once it got away. I fancy this is only an afterthought of kind \\nMaster Ferny\\'s: just a way of increasing his profits from the affair. The \\nchief danger is that the poor beast is probably at death\\'s door. But there \\ndoes not seem any choice. What does he want for it?\\' \\n\\nBill Ferny\\'s price was twelve silver pennies; and that was indeed at \\nleast three times the pony\\'s value in those pans. It proved to be a bony, \\nunderfed, and dispirited animal; but it did not look like dying just yet. \\n\\nMr. Butterbur paid for it himself, and offered Merry another eighteen pence \\nas some compensation for the lost animals. He was an honest man, and \\nwell-off as things were reckoned in Bree; but thirty silver pennies was a \\nsore blow to him, and being cheated by Bill Ferny made it harder to bear. \\n\\nAsa matter of fact he came out on the right side in the end. It turned \\nout later that only one horse had been actually stolen. The others had been \\ndriven off, or had bolted in terror, and were found wandering in different \\ncorners of the Bree-land. Merry\\'s ponies had escaped altogether, and \\neventually (having a good deal of sense) they made their way to the Downs in \\nsearch of Fatty Lumpkin. So they came under the care of Tom Bombadil for a \\nwhile, and were well-off. But when news of the events at Bree came to Tom\\'s \\nears, he sent them to Mr. Butterbur, who thus got five good beasts at a very \\nfair price. They had to work harder in Bree, but Bob treated them well; so \\non the whole they were lucky: they missed a dark and dangerous journey. But \\nthey never came to Rivendell. \\n\\nHowever, in the meanwhile for all Mr. Butterbur knew his money was gone \\nfor good, or for bad. And he had other troubles. For there was a great \\ncommotion as soon as the remaining guests were astir and heard news of the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nraid on the inn. The southern travellers had lost several horses and blamed \\nthe innkeeper loudly, until it became known that one of their own number had \\nalso disappeared in the night, none other than Bill Ferny\\'s squint-eyed \\ncompanion. Suspicion fell on him at once. \\n\\n\\'If you pick up with a horse-thief, and bring him to my house,\\' said \\nButterbur angrily, \\'you ought to pay for all the damage yourselves and not \\ncome shouting at me. Go and ask Ferny where your handsome friend is!\\' But it \\nappeared that he was nobody\\'s friend, and nobody could recollect when he had \\njoined their party. \\n\\nAfter their breakfast the hobbits had to re-pack, and get together \\nfurther supplies for the longer journey they were now expecting. It was \\nclose on ten o\\'clock before they at last got off. By that time the whole of \\nBree was buzzing with excitement. Frodo\\'s vanishing trick; the appearance of \\nthe black horsemen; the robbing of the stables; and not least the news that \\nStrider the Ranger had joined the mysterious hobbits, made such a tale as \\nwould last for many uneventful years. Most of the inhabitants of Bree and \\nStaddle, and many even from Combe and Archet, were crowded in the road \\nto \\n\\nsee the travellers start. The other guests in the inn were at the doors or \\nhanging out of the windows. \\n\\nStrider had changed his mind, and he decided to leave Bree by the main \\nroad. Any attempt to set off across country at once would only make matters \\nworse: half the inhabitants would follow them, to see what they were up to, \\nand to prevent them from trespassing. \\n\\nThey said farewell to Nob and Bob, and took leave of Mr. Butterbur with \\nmany thanks. \\'I hope we shall meet again some day, when things are merry \\nonce more,\\' said Frodo. \\'I should like nothing better than to stay in your \\nhouse in peace for a while.\\' \\n\\nThey tramped off, anxious and downhearted, under the eyes of the crowd. \\nNot all the faces were friendly, nor all the words that were shouted. But \\nStrider seemed to be held in awe by most of the Bree-landers, and those that \\nhe stared at shut their mouths and drew away. He walked in front with Frodo; \\nnext came Merry and Pippin; and last came Sam leading the pony, which was \\nladen with as much of their baggage as they had the heart to give it; but \\nalready it looked less dejected, as if it approved of the change in its \\nfortunes. Sam was chewing an apple thoughtfully. He had a pocket full of \\nthem: a parting present from Nob and Bob. \\'Apples for walking, and a pipe \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfor sitting,\\' he said. \\'But I reckon I\\'ll miss them both before long.\\' \\n\\nThe hobbits took no notice of the inquisitive heads that peeped out of \\ndoors, or popped over walls and fences, as they passed. But as they drew \\nnear to the further gate, Frodo saw a dark ill-kept house behind a thick \\nhedge: the last house in the village. In one of the windows he caught a \\nglimpse of a sallow face with sly, slanting eyes; but it vanished at once. \\n\\n\\'So that\\'s where that southerner is hiding!\\' he thought. \\'He looks more \\nthan half like a goblin.\\' \\n\\nOver the hedge another man was staring boldly. He had heavy black \\nbrows, and dark scornful eyes; his large mouth curled in a sneer. He was \\nsmoking a short black pipe. As they approached he took it out of his mouth \\nand spat. \\n\\n\\'Morning, Longshanks!\\' he said. \\'Off early? Found some friends at \\nlast?\\' Strider nodded, but did not answer. \\'Morning, my little friends!\\' he \\nsaid to the others. \\'I suppose you know who you\\'ve taken up with? That\\'s \\nStick -at-naught Strider, that is! Though I\\'ve heard other names not so \\npretty. Watch out tonight! And you, Sammie, don\\'t go ill-treating my poor \\nold pony! Pah!\\' He spat again. \\n\\nSam turned quickly. \\'And you. Ferny,\\' he said, \\'put your ugly face out \\nof sight, or it will get hurt.\\' With a sudden flick, quick as lightning, an \\napple left his hand and hit Bill square on the nose. He ducked too late, and \\ncurses came from behind the hedge. \\'Waste of a good apple,\\' said Sam \\nregretfully, and strode on. \\n\\nAt last they left the village behind. The escort of children and \\nstragglers that had followed them got tired and turned back at the \\nSouth-gate. Passing through, they kept on along the Road for some miles. It \\nbent to the left, curving back into its eastward line as it rounded the feet \\nof Bree-hill, and then it began to run swiftly downwards into wooded \\ncountry. To their left they could see some of the houses and hobbit -holes of \\nStaddle on the gentler south-eastern slopes of the hill; down in a deep \\nhollow away north of the Road there were wisps of rising smoke that showed \\nwhere Combe lay; \\n\\nArchet was hidden in the trees beyond. \\n\\nAfter the Road had run down some way, and had left Bree-hill standing \\ntall and brown behind, they came on a narrow track that led off towards the \\nNorth. \\'This is where we leave the open and take to cover,\\' said Strider. \\n\\n\\'Not a \"short cut\", I hope,\\' said Pippin. \\'Our last short cut through \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwoods nearly ended in disaster.\\' \\n\\n\\'Ah, but you had not got me with you then,\\' laughed Strider. \\'My cuts, \\nshort or long, don\\'t go wrong.\\' He took a look up and down the Road. No one \\nwas in sight; and he led the way quickly down towards the wooded valley. \\n\\nHis plan, as far as they could understand it without knowing the \\ncountry, was to go towards Archet at first, but to bear right and pass it on \\nthe east, and then to steer as straight as he could over the wild lands to \\nWeathertop Hill. In that way they would, if all went well, cut off a great \\nloop of the Road, which further on bent southwards to avoid the Midgewater \\nMarshes. But, of course, they would have to pass through the marshes \\nthemselves, and Strider\\'s description of them was not encouraging. \\n\\nHowever, in the meanwhile, walking was not unpleasant. Indeed, if it \\nhad not been for the disturbing events of the night before, they would have \\nenjoyed this pan of the journey better than any up to that time. The sun was \\nshining, clear but not too hot. The woods in the valley were still leafy and \\nfull of colour, and seemed peaceful and wholesome. Strider guided them \\nconfidently among the many crossing paths, although left to themselves they \\nwould soon have been at a loss. He was taking a wandering course with many \\nturns and doublings, to put off any pursuit. \\n\\n\\'Bill Ferny will have watched where we left the Road, for certain,\\' he \\nsaid; \\'though I don\\'t think he will follow us himself. He knows the land \\nround here well enough, but he knows he is not a match for me in a wood. It \\nis what he may tell others that I am afraid of. I don\\'t suppose they are far \\naway. If they think we have made for Archet, so much the better.\\' \\n\\nWhether because of Strider\\'s skill or for some other reason, they saw \\nno sign and heard no sound of any other living thing all that day: neither \\ntwo-footed, except birds; nor four-footed, except one fox and a few \\nsquirrels. The next day they began to steer a steady course eastwards; and \\nstill all was quiet and peaceful. On the third day out from Bree they came \\nout of the Chetwood. The land had been falling steadily, ever since they \\nturned aside from the Road, and they now entered a wide flat expanse of \\ncountry, much more difficult to manage. They were far beyond the borders of \\nthe Bree-land, out in the pathless wilderness, and drawing near to the \\nMidge- water Marshes. \\n\\nThe ground now became damp, and in places boggy and here and there they \\ncame upon pools, and wide stretches of reeds and rushes filled with the \\nwarbling of little hidden birds. They had to pick their way carefully to \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nkeep both dry-footed and on their proper course. At first they made \\nfan-progress, but as they went on, their passage became slower and more \\ndangerous. The marshes were bewildering and treacherous, and there was no \\npermanent trail even for Rangers to find through their shifting quagmires. \\n\\nThe flies began to torment them, and the air was full of clouds of tiny \\nmidges that crept up their sleeves and breeches and into their hair. \\n\\n\\'I am being eaten alive!\\' cried Pippin. \\'Midgewater! There are more \\nmidges than water!\\' \\n\\n\\'What do they live on when they can\\'t get hobbit?\\' asked Sam, \\nscratching his neck. \\n\\nThey spent a miserable day in this lonely and unpleasant country. Their \\ncamping-place was damp, cold, and uncomfortable; and the biting insects \\nwould not let them sleep. There were also abominable creatures haunting the \\nreeds and tussocks that from the sound of them were evil relatives of the \\ncricket. There were thousands of them, and they squeaked all round, \\nneek-breek, breek-neek, unceasingly all the night, until the hobbits were \\nnearly frantic. \\n\\nThe next day, the fourth, was little better, and the night almost as \\ncomfortless. Though the Neekerbreekers (as Sam called them) had been left \\nbehind, the midges still pursued them. \\n\\nAs Frodo lay, tired but unable to close his eyes, it seemed to him that \\nfar away there came a light in the eastern sky: it flashed and faded many \\ntimes. It was not the dawn, for that was still some hours off. \\n\\n\\'What is the light?\\' he said to Strider, who had risen, and was \\nstanding, gazing ahead into the night. \\n\\n\\'I do not know,\\' Strider answered. \\'It is too distant to make out. It \\nis like lightning that leaps up from the hill-tops.\\' \\n\\nFrodo lay down again, but for a long while he could still see the white \\nflashes, and against them the tall dark figure of Strider, standing silent \\nand watchful. At last he passed into uneasy sleep. \\n\\nThey had not gone far on the fifth day when they left the last \\nstraggling pools and reed-beds of the marshes behind them. The land before \\nthem began steadily to rise again. Away in the distance eastward they could \\nnow see a line of hills. The highest of them was at the right of the line \\nand a little separated from the others. It had a conical top, slightly \\nflattened at the summit. \\n\\n\\'That is Weathertop,\\' said Strider. \\'The Old Road, which we have left \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfar away on our right, runs to the south of it and passes not far from its \\nfoot. We might reach it by noon tomorrow, if we go straight towards it. I \\nsuppose we had better do so.\\' \\n\\n\\'What do you mean?\\' asked Frodo. \\n\\n\\'I mean: when we do get there, it is not certain what we shall find. It \\nis close to the Road.\\' \\n\\n\\'But surely we were hoping to find Gandalf there?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes; but the hope is faint. If he comes this way at all, he may not \\npass through Bree, and so he may not know what we are doing. And anyway, \\nunless by luck we arrive almost together, we shall miss one another; it will \\nnot be safe for him or for us to wait there long. If the Riders fail to find \\nus in the wilderness, they are likely to make for Weathertop themselves. It \\ncommands a wide view all round. Indeed, there are many birds and beasts in \\nthis country that could see us, as we stand here, from that hill-top. Not \\nall the birds are to be trusted, and there are other spies more evil than \\nthey are.\\' \\n\\nThe hobbits looked anxiously at the distant hills. Sam looked up into \\nthe pale sky, fearing to see hawks or eagles hovering over them with bright \\nunfriendly eyes. \\'You do make me feel uncomfortable and lonesome, Strider!\\' \\nhe said. \\n\\n\\'What do you advise us to do?\\' asked Frodo. \\n\\n\\'I think,\\' answered Strider slowly, as if he was not quite sure, \\'I \\nthink the best thing is to go as straight eastward from here as we can, to \\nmake for the line of hills, not for Weathertop. There we can strike a path I \\nknow that runs at their feet; it will bring us to Weathertop from the north \\nand less openly. Then we shall see what we shall see.\\' \\n\\nAll that day they plodded along, until the cold and early evening came \\ndown. The land became drier and more barren; but mists and vapours lay \\nbehind them on the marshes. A few melancholy birds were piping and wailing, \\nuntil the round red sun sank slowly into the western shadows; then an empty \\nsilence fell. The hobbits thought of the soft light of sunset glancing \\nthrough the cheerful windows of Bag End far away. \\n\\nAt the day\\'s end they came to a stream that wandered down from the \\nhills to lose itself in the stagnant marshland, and they went up along its \\nbanks while the light lasted. It was already night when at last they halted \\nand made their camp under some stunted alder -trees by the shores of the \\nstream. Ahead there loomed now against the dusky sky the bleak and treeless \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbacks of the hills. That night they set a watch, and Strider, it seemed, did \\nnot sleep at all. The moon was waxing, and in the early night -hours a cold \\ngrey light lay on the land. \\n\\nNext morning they set out again soon after sunrise. There was a frost \\nin the air, and the sky was a pale clear blue. The hobbits felt refreshed, \\nas if they had had a night of unbroken sleep. Already they were getting used \\nto much walking on short commons - shorter at any rate than what in the \\nShire they would have thought barely enough to keep them on their legs. \\nPippin declared that Frodo was looking twice the hobbit that he had been. \\n\\n\\'Very odd,\\' said Frodo, tightening his belt, \\'considering that there is \\nactually a good deal less of me. I hope the thinning process will not go on \\nindefinitely, or I shall become a wraith.\\' \\n\\n\\'Do not speak of such things!\\' said Strider quickly, and with \\nsurprising earnestness. \\n\\nThe hills drew nearer. They made an undulating ridge, often rising \\nalmost to a thousand feet, and here and there falling again to low clefts or \\npasses leading into the eastern land beyond. Along the crest of the ridge \\nthe hobbits could see what looked to be the remains of green-grown walls and \\ndikes, and in the clefts there still stood the ruins of old works of stone. \\n\\nBy night they had reached the feet of the westward slopes, and there they \\ncamped. It was the night of the fifth of October, and they were six days out \\nfrom Bree. \\n\\nIn the morning they found, for the first time since they had left the \\nChetwood, a track plain to see. They turned right and followed it \\nsouthwards. It ran cunningly, taking a line that seemed chosen so as to keep \\nas much hidden as possible from the view, both of the hill-tops above and of \\nthe flats to the west. It dived into dells, and hugged steep banks; and \\nwhere it passed over flatter and more open ground on either side of it there \\nwere lines of large boulders and hewn stones that screened the travellers \\nalmost like a hedge. \\n\\n\\'I wonder who made this path, and what for,\\' said Merry, as they walked \\nalong one of these avenues, where the stones were unusually large and \\nclosely set. \\'I am not sure that I like it: it has a - well, rather a \\nbarrow- wightish look. Is there any barrow on Weathertop?\\' \\n\\n\\'No. There is no barrow on Weathertop, nor on any of these hills,\\' \\nanswered Strider. \\'The Men of the West did not live here; though in their \\nlatter days they defended the hills for a while against the evil that came \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nout of Angmar. This path was made to serve the forts along the walls. But \\nlong before, in the first days of the North Kingdom, they built a great \\nwatch-tower on Weathertop, Amon Syl they called it. It was burned and \\nbroken, and nothing remains of it now but a tumbled ring, like a rough crown \\non the old hill\\'s head. Yet once it was tall and fair. It is told that \\nElendil stood there watching for the coming of Gil-galad out of the West, in \\nthe days of the Last Alliance.\\' \\n\\nThe hobbits gazed at Strider. It seemed that he was learned in old \\nlore, as well as in the ways of the wild. \\'Who was Gil-galad?\\' asked Merry; \\nbut Strider did not answer, and seemed to be lost in thought. Suddenly a low \\nvoice murmured: \\n\\nGil-galad was an Elven-king. \\n\\nOf him the harpers sadly sing: \\n\\nthe last whose realm was fair and free \\n\\nbetween the Mountains and the Sea. \\n\\nHis sword was long, his lance was keen, \\nhis shining helm afar was seen; \\nthe countless stars of heaven\\'s field \\nwere mirrored in his silver shield. \\n\\nBut long ago he rode away, \\nand where he dwelleth none can say; \\nfor into darkness fell his star \\nin Mordor where the shadows are. \\n\\nThe others turned in amazement, for the voice was Sam\\'s. \\n\\n\\'Don\\'t stop!\\' said Merry. \\n\\n\\'That\\'s all I know,\\' stammered Sam, blushing. \\'I learned it from Mr. \\n\\nBilbo when I was a lad. He used to tell me tales like that, knowing how I \\nwas always one for hearing about Elves. It was Mr. Bilbo as taught me my \\nletters. He was mighty book -learned was dear old Mr. Bilbo. And he wrote \\npoetry. He wrote what I have just said.\\' \\n\\n\\'He did not make it up,\\' said Strider. \\'It is pan of the lay that is \\ncalled The Fall of Gil-galad, which is in an ancient tongue. Bilbo must have \\ntranslated it. I never knew that.\\' \\n\\n\\'There was a lot more,\\' said Sam, \\'all about Mordor. I didn\\'t learn \\nthat part, it gave me the shivers I never thought I should be going that way \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmyself!\\' \\n\\n\\'Going to Mordor!\\' cried Pippin. \\'I hope it won\\'t come to that!\\' \\n\\n\\'Do not speak that name so loudly!\\' said Strider. \\n\\nIt was already mid-day when they drew near the southern end of the \\npath, and saw before them, in the pale clear light of the October sun, a \\ngrey-green bank, leading up like a bridge on to the northward slope of the \\nhill They decided to make for the top at once, while the daylight was broad \\nConcealment was no longer possible, and they could only hope that no enemy \\nor spy was observing them. Nothing was to be seen moving on the hill. If \\nGandalf was anywhere about, there was no sign of him. \\n\\nOn the western flank of Weathertop they found a sheltered hollow, at \\nthe bottom of which there was a bowl -shaped dell with grassy sides. There \\nthey left Sam and Pippin with the pony and their packs and luggage. The \\nother three went on. After half an hour\\'s plodding climb Strider reached the \\ncrown of the hill; Frodo and Merry followed, tired and breathless. The last \\nslope had been steep and rocky. \\n\\nOn the top they found, as Strider had said, a wide ring of ancient \\nstonework, now crumbling or covered with age-long grass. But in the centre a \\ncairn of broken stones had been piled. They were blackened as if with fire. \\nAbout them the turf was burned to the roots and all within the ring the \\ngrass was scorched and shrivelled, as if flames had swept the hill-top; but \\nthere was no sign of any living thing. \\n\\nStanding upon the rim of the ruined circle, they saw all round below \\nthem a wide prospect, for the most pan of lands empty and featureless, \\nexcept for patches of woodland away to the south, beyond which they caught \\nhere and there the glint of distant water. Beneath them on this southern \\nside there ran like a ribbon the Old Road, coming out of the West and \\nwinding up and down, until it faded behind a ridge of dark land to the east. \\nNothing was moving on it. Following its line eastward with their eyes they \\nsaw the Mountains: the nearer foothills were brown and sombre; \\n\\nbehind them stood taller shapes of grey, and behind those again were \\nhigh white peaks glimmering among the clouds. \\n\\n\\'Well, here we are!\\' said Merry. \\'And very cheerless and uninviting it \\nlooks! There is no water and no shelter. And no sign of Gandalf. But I don\\'t \\nblame him for not waiting - if he ever came here.\\' \\n\\n\\'I wonder,\\' said Strider, looking round thoughtfully. \\'Even if he was a \\nday or two behind us at Bree, he could have arrived here first. He can ride \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nvery swiftly when need presses.\\' Suddenly he stooped and looked at the stone \\non the top of the cairn; it was flatter than the others, and whiter, as if \\nit had escaped the fire. He picked it up and examined it, turning it in his \\nfingers. \"This has been handled recently,\\' he said. \\'What do you think of \\nthese marks?\\' \\n\\nOn the flat under-side Frodo saw some scratches: \\'There seems to he a \\nstroke, a dot, and three more strokes,\\' he said. \\n\\n\\'The stroke on the left might be a G-rune with thin branches,\\' said \\nStrider. \\'It might be a sign left by Gandalf, though one cannot be sure. The \\nscratches are fine, and they certainly look fresh. But the marks might mean \\nsomething quite different, and have nothing to do with us. Rangers use \\nrunes, and they come here sometimes.\\' \\n\\n\\'What could they mean, even if Gandalf made them?\\' asked Merry \\n\\n\\'I should say,\\' answered Strider, \\'that they stood for G3, and were a \\nsign that Gandalf was here on October the third: that is three days ago now. \\n\\nIt would also show that he was in a hurry and danger was at hand, so that he \\nhad no time or did not dare to write anything longer or plainer. If that is \\nso, we must be wary.\\' \\n\\n\\'I wish we could feel sure that he made the marks, whatever they may \\nmean,\\' said Frodo \\'It would be a great comfort to know that he was on the \\nway, in front of us or behind us.\\' \\n\\n\\'Perhaps,\\' said Strider. \\'For myself, I believe that he was here, and \\nwas in danger. There have been scorching flames here; and now the light that \\nwe saw three nights ago in the eastern sky comes back to my mind. I guess \\nthat he was attacked on this hill-top, but with what result I cannot tell. \\n\\nHe is here no longer, and we must now look after ourselves and make our own \\nway to Rivendell, as best we can \\' \\n\\n\\'How far is Rivendell?\\' asked Merry, gazing round wearily. The world \\nlooked wild and wide from Weathertop. \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know if the Road has ever been measured in miles beyond the \\nForsaken Inn, a day\\'s journey east of Bree,\\' answered Strider. \\'Some say it \\nis so far, and some say otherwise. It is a strange road, and folk are glad \\nto reach their journey\\'s end, whether the time is long or short. But I know \\nhow long it would take me on my own feet, with fair weather and no ill \\nfortune twelve days from here to the Ford of Bruinen, where the Road crosses \\nthe Loudwater that runs out of Rivendell. We have at least a fortnight\\'s \\njourney before us, for I do not think we shall be able to use the Road.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'A fortnight!\\' said Frodo. \\'A lot may happen in that time.\\' \\n\\n\\'It may,\\' said Strider. \\n\\nThey stood for a while silent on the hill -top, near its southward edge. \\n\\nIn that lonely place Frodo for the first time fully realized his \\nhomelessness and danger. He wished bitterly that his fortune had left him in \\nthe quiet and beloved Shire. He stared down at the hateful Road, leading \\nback westward - to his home. Suddenly he was aware that two black specks \\nwere moving slowly along it, going westward; and looking again he saw that \\nthree others were creeping eastward to meet them. He gave a cry and clutched \\nStrider\\'s arm. \\n\\n\\'Look,\\' he said, pointing downwards. \\n\\nAt once Strider flung himself on the ground behind the ruined circle, \\npulling Frodo down beside him. Merry threw himself alongside. \\n\\n\\'What is it?\\' he whispered. \\n\\n\\'I do not know, but I fear the worst,\\' answered Strider. \\n\\nSlowly they crawled up to the edge of the ring again, and peered \\nthrough a cleft between two jagged stones. The light was no longer bright, \\nfor the clear morning had faded, and clouds creeping out of the East had now \\novertaken the sun, as it began to go down. They could all see the black \\nspecks, but neither Frodo nor Merry could make out their shapes for certain; \\nyet something told them that there, far below, were Black Riders assembling \\non the Road beyond the foot of the hill. \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Strider, whose keener sight left him in no doubt. \\'The \\nenemy is here!\\' \\n\\nHastily they crept away and slipped down the north side of the hill to \\nfind their companions. \\n\\nSam and Peregrin had not been idle. They had explored the small dell \\nand the surrounding slopes. Not far away they found a spring of clear water \\nin the hillside, and near it footprints not more than a day or two old. In \\nthe dell itself they found recent traces of a fire, and other signs of a \\nhasty camp. There were some fallen rocks on the edge of the dell nearest to \\nthe hill. Behind them Sam came upon a small store of firewood neatly \\nstacked. \\n\\n\\'I wonder if old Gandalf has been here,\\' he said to Pippin. \\'Whoever it \\nwas put this stuff here meant to come back it seems.\\' \\n\\nStrider was greatly interested in these discoveries. \\'I wish I had \\nwaited and explored the ground down here myself,\\' he said, hurrying off to \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe spring to examine the footprints. \\n\\n\\'It is just as I feared,\\' he said, when he came back. \\'Sam and Pippin \\nhave trampled the soft ground, and the marks are spoilt or confused. Rangers \\nhave been here lately. It is they who left the firewood behind. But there \\nare also several newer tracks that were not made by Rangers. At least one \\nset was made, only a day or two ago, by heavy boots. At least one. I cannot \\nnow be certain, but I think there were many booted feet.\\' He paused and \\nstood in anxious thought. \\n\\nEach of the hobbits saw in his mind a vision of the cloaked and booted \\nRiders. If the horsemen had already found the dell, the sooner Strider led \\nthem somewhere else the better. Sam viewed the hollow with great dislike, \\nnow that he had heard news of their enemies on the Road, only a few miles \\naway. \\n\\n\\'Hadn\\'t we better clear out quick, Mr. Strider?\\' he asked impatiently. \\n\\n\\'It is getting late, and I don\\'t like this hole: it makes my heart sink \\nsomehow.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, we certainly must decide what to do at once,\\' answered Strider, \\nlooking up and considering the time and the weather. \\'Well, Sam,\\' he said at \\nlast, \\'I do not like this place either; but I cannot think of anywhere \\nbetter that we could reach before nightfall. At least we are out of sight \\nfor the moment, and if we moved we should be much more likely to be seen \\nspies. All we could do would be to go right out of our way back north on \\nthis side of the line of hills, where the land is all much the same as it is \\nhere. The Road is watched, but we should have to cross it, if we tried to \\ntake cover in the thickets away to the south. On the north side of the Road \\nbeyond the hills the country is bare and flat for miles.\\' \\n\\n\\'Can the Riders see ?\\' asked Merry. \\'I mean, they seem usually to have \\nused their noses rather than their eyes, smelling for us, if smelling is the \\nright word, at least in the daylight. But you made us lie down flat when you \\nsaw them down below; and now you talk of being seen, if we move.\\' \\n\\n\\'I was too careless on the hill-top,\\' answered Strider. \\'I was very \\nanxious to find some sign of Gandalf; but it was a mistake for three of us \\nto go up and stand there so long. For the black horses can see, and the \\nRiders can use men and other creatures as spies, as we found at Bree. They \\nthemselves do not see the world of light as we do, but our shapes cast \\nshadows in their minds, which only the noon sun destroys; and in the dark \\nthey perceive many signs and forms that are hidden from us: then they are \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmost to be feared. And at all times they smell the blood of living things, \\ndesiring and hating it. Senses, too, there are other than sight or smell. We \\ncan feel their presence - it troubled our hearts, as soon as we came here, \\nand before we saw them; they feel ours more keenly. Also,\\' he added, and his \\nvoice sank to a whisper, \\'the Ring draws them.\\' \\n\\n\\'Is there no escape then?\\' said Frodo, looking round wildly. \\'If I move \\nI shall be seen and hunted! If I stay, I shall draw them to me!\\' \\n\\nStrider laid his hand on his shoulder. \\'There is still hope,\\' he said. \\n\\n\\'You are not alone. Let us take this wood that is set ready for the fire as \\na sign. There is little shelter or defence here, but fire shall serve for \\nboth. Sauron can put fire to his evil uses, as he can all things, but these \\nRiders do not love it, and fear those who wield it. Fire is our friend in \\nthe wilderness.\\' \\n\\n\\'Maybe,\\' muttered Sam. \\'It is also as good a way of saying \"here we \\nare\" as I can think of, bar shouting.\\' \\n\\nDown in the lowest and most sheltered corner of the dell they lit a \\nfire, and prepared a meal. The shades of evening began to fall, and it grew \\ncold. They were suddenly aware of great hunger, for they had not eaten \\nanything since breakfast; but they dared not make more than a frugal supper. \\nThe lands ahead were empty of all save birds and beasts, unfriendly places \\ndeserted by all the races of the world. Rangers passed at times beyond the \\nhills, but they were few and did not stay. Other wanderers were rare, and of \\nevil sort: trolls might stray down at times out of the northern valleys of \\nthe Misty Mountains. Only on the Road would travellers be found, most often \\ndwarves, hurrying along on business of their own, and with no help and few \\nwords to spare for strangers. \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t see how our food can be made to last,\\' said Frodo. \\'We have \\nbeen careful enough in the last few days, and this supper is no feast; but \\nwe have used more than we ought, if we have two weeks still to go, and \\nperhaps more.\\' \\n\\n\\'There is food in the wild,\\' said Strider; \\'berry, root, and herb; and \\nI have some skill as a hunter at need. You need not be afraid of starving \\nbefore winter comes. But gathering and catching food is long and weary work, \\nand we need haste. So tighten your belts, and think with hope of the tables \\nof Elrond\\'s house!\\' \\n\\nThe cold increased as darkness came on. Peering out from the edge of \\nthe dell they could see nothing but a grey land now vanishing quickly into \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nshadow. The sky above had cleared again and was slowly filled with twinkling \\nstars. Frodo and his companions huddled round the fire, wrapped in every \\ngarment and blanket they possessed; but Strider was content with a single \\ncloak, and sat a little apart, drawing thoughtfully at his pipe. \\n\\nAs night fell and the light of the fire began to shine out brightly he \\nbegan to tell them tales to keep their minds from fear. He knew many \\nhistories and legends of long ago, of Elves and Men and the good and evil \\ndeeds of the Elder Days. They wondered how old he was, and where he had \\nlearned all this lore. \\n\\nTell us of Gil-galad,\\' said Merry suddenly, when he paused at the end \\nof a story of the Elf-Kingdoms. \\'Do you know any more of that old lay that \\nyou spoke of?\\' \\n\\n\\'I do indeed,\\' answered Strider. \\'So also does Frodo, for it concerns \\nus closely.\\' Merry and Pippin looked at Frodo, who was staring into the \\nfire. \\n\\n\\'I know only the little that Gandalf has told me,\\' said Frodo slowly. \\n\\'Gil-galad was the last of the great Elf-kings of Middle-earth. Gil-galad is \\nStarlight in their tongue. With Elendil, the Elf-friend, he went to the land \\nof \\' \\n\\n\\'No!\\' said Strider interrupting, \\'I do not think that tale should be \\ntold now with the servants of the Enemy at hand. If we win through to the \\nhouse of Elrond, you may hear it there, told in full.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then tell us some other tale of the old days,\\' begged Sam; \\'a tale \\nabout the Elves before the fading time. I would dearly like to hear more \\nabout Elves; the dark seems to press round so close.\\' \\n\\n\\'I will tell you the tale of Tin(r)viel,\\' said Strider, \\'in brief - for \\nit is a long tale of which the end is not known; and there are none now, \\nexcept Elrond, that remember it aright as it was told of old. It is a fair \\ntale, though it is sad, as are all the tales of Middle-earth, and yet it may \\nlift up your hearts.\\' He was silent for some time, and then he began not to \\nspeak but to chant softly: \\n\\nThe leaves were long, the grass was green, \\n\\nThe hemlock-umbels tall and fair, \\n\\nAnd in the glade a light was seen \\n\\nOf stars in shadow shimmering. \\n\\nTin(r)viel was dancing there \\n\\nTo music of a pipe unseen, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd light of stars was in her hair, \\n\\nAnd in her raiment glimmering. \\n\\nThere Beren came from mountains cold, \\nAnd lost he wandered under leaves, \\n\\nAnd where the Elven-river rolled \\nHe walked alone and sorrowing. \\n\\nHe peered between the hemlock-leaves \\nAnd saw in wander flowers of gold \\nUpon her mantle and her sleeves, \\n\\nAnd her hair like shadow following. \\n\\nEnchantment healed his weary feet \\nThat over hills were doomed to roam; \\n\\nAnd forth he hastened, strong and fleet, \\nAnd grasped at moonbeams glistening. \\nThrough woven woods in Elvenhome \\nShe tightly fled on dancing feet, \\n\\nAnd left him lonely still to roam \\nIn the silent forest listening. \\n\\nHe heard there oft the flying sound \\nOf feet as light as linden-leaves, \\n\\nOr music welling underground, \\n\\nIn hidden hollows quavering. \\n\\nNow withered lay the hemlock-sheaves, \\nAnd one by one with sighing sound \\nWhispering fell the beechen leaves \\nIn the wintry woodland wavering. \\n\\nHe sought her ever, wandering far \\nWhere leaves of years were thickly strewn, \\nBy light of moon and ray of star \\nIn frosty heavens shivering. \\n\\nHer mantle glinted in the moon, \\n\\nAs on a hill-top high and far \\n\\nShe danced, and at her feet was strewn \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA mist of silver quivering. \\n\\n\\n\\nWhen winter passed, she came again, \\nAnd her song released the sudden spring, \\nLike rising lark, and falling rain, \\n\\nAnd melting water bubbling. \\n\\nHe saw the elven-flowers spring \\nAbout her feet, and healed again \\nHe longed by her to dance and sing \\nUpon the grass untroubling. \\n\\nAgain she fled, but swift he came. \\nTin(r)viel! Tin(r)viel! \\n\\nHe called her by her elvish name; \\n\\nAnd there she halted listening. \\n\\nOne moment stood she, and a spell \\nHis voice laid on her: Beren came, \\n\\nAnd doom fell on Tin(r)viel \\nThat in his arms lay glistening. \\n\\nAs Beren looked into her eyes \\nWithin the shadows of her hair, \\n\\nThe trembling starlight of the skies \\nHe saw there mirrored shimmering. \\nTin(r)viel the elven-fair, \\n\\nImmortal maiden elven-wise, \\n\\nAbout him cast her shadowy hair \\nAnd arms like silver glimmering. \\n\\nLong was the way that fate them bore, \\nO\\'er stony mountains cold and grey, \\nThrough halls of iron and darkling door, \\nAnd woods of nightshade morrowless. \\nThe Sundering Seas between them lay, \\nAnd yet at last they met once more, \\n\\nAnd long ago they passed away \\nIn the forest singing sorrowless. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStrider sighed and paused before he spoke again. \\'That is a song,\\' he \\nsaid, \\'in the mode that is called ann-thennath among the Elves, but is hard \\nto render in our Common Speech, and this is but a rough echo of it. It tells \\nof the meeting of Beren son of Barahir and L(r)thien Tin(r)viel. Beren was a \\nmortal man, but L(r)thien was the daughter of Thingol, a King of Elves upon \\nMiddle-earth when the world was young; and she was the fairest maiden that \\nhas ever been among all the children of this world. As the stars above the \\nmists of the Northern lands was her loveliness, and in her face was a \\nshining light. In those days the Great Enemy, of whom Sauron of Mordor was \\nbut a servant, dwelt in Angband in the North, and the Elves of the West \\ncoming back to Middle-earth made war upon him to regain the Silmarils which \\nhe had stolen; and the fathers of Men aided the Elves. But the Enemy was \\nvictorious and Barahir was slain, and Beren escaping through great peril \\ncame over the Mountains of Terror into the hidden Kingdom of Thingol in the \\nforest of Neldoreth. There he beheld L(r)thien singing and dancing in a glade \\nbeside the enchanted river Esgalduin; and he named her Tin(r)viel, that is \\nNightingale in the language of old. Many sorrows befell them afterwards, and \\nthey were parted long. Tin(r)viel rescued Beren from the dungeons of Sauron, \\nand together they passed through great dangers, and cast down even the Great \\nEnemy from his throne, and took from his iron crown one of the three \\nSilmarils, brightest of all jewels, to be the bride-price of L(r)thien to \\nThingol her father. Yet at the last Beren was slain by the Wolf that came \\nfrom the gates of Angband, and he died in the arms of Tin(r)viel. But she \\nchose mortality, and to die from the world, so that she might follow him; \\nand it is sung that they met again beyond the Sundering Seas, and after a \\nbrief time walking alive once more in the green woods, together they passed, \\nlong ago, beyond the confines of this world. So it is that L(r)thien Tin(r)viel \\nalone of the Elf-kindred has died indeed and left the world, and they have \\nlost her whom they most loved. But from her the lineage of the Elf-lords of \\nold descended among Men. There live still those of whom L(r)thien was the \\nforemother, and it is said that her line shall never fail. Elrond of \\nRivendell is of that Kin. For of Beren and L(r)thien was born Dior Thingol\\'s \\nheir; and of him Elwing the White whom Edrendil wedded, he that sailed his \\nship out of the mists of the world into the seas of heaven with the Silmaril \\nupon his brow. And of Edrendil came the Kings of N(r)menor, that is \\nWesternesse.\\' \\n\\nAs Strider was speaking they watched his strange eager face, dimly lit \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nin the red glow of the wood-fire. His eyes shone, and his voice was rich and \\ndeep. Above him was a black starry sky. Suddenly a pale light appeared over \\nthe crown of Weathertop behind him. The waxing moon was climbing \\nslowly \\n\\nabove the hill that overshadowed them, and the stars above the hill-top \\nfaded. \\n\\nThe story ended. The hobbits moved and stretched. \\'Look!\\' said Merry. \\n\\'The Moon is rising: it must be getting late.\\' \\n\\nThe others looked up. Even as they did so, they saw on the top of the \\nhill something small and dark against the glimmer of the moonrise. It was \\nperhaps only a large stone or jutting rock shown up by the pale light. \\n\\nSam and Merry got up and walked away from the fire. Frodo and Pippin \\nremained seated in silence. Strider was watching the moonlight on the hill \\nintently. All seemed quiet and still, but Frodo felt a cold dread creeping \\nover his heart, now that Strider was no longer speaking. He huddled closer \\nto the fire. At that moment Sam came running back from the edge of the dell. \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know what it is,\\' he said, \\'but I suddenly felt afraid. I \\ndurstn\\'t go outside this dell for any money; I felt that something was \\ncreeping up the slope.\\' \\n\\n\\'Did you see anything?\\' asked Frodo, springing to his feet. \\n\\n\\'No, sir. I saw nothing, but I didn\\'t stop to look.\\' \\n\\n\\'I saw something,\\' said Merry; \\'or I thought I did - away westwards \\nwhere the moonlight was falling on the flats beyond the shadow of the \\nhill-tops, I thought there were two or three black shapes. They seemed to be \\nmoving this way.\\' \\n\\n\\'Keep close to the fire, with your faces outward!\\' cried Strider. \\'Get \\nsome of the longer sticks ready in your hands!\\' \\n\\nFor a breathless time they sat there, silent and alert, with their \\nbacks turned to the wood-fire, each gazing into the shadows that encircled \\nthem. Nothing happened. There was no sound or movement in the night. \\nFrodo \\n\\nstirred, feeling that he must break the silence: he longed to shout out \\naloud. \\n\\n\\'Hush!\\' whispered Strider. \\'What\\'s that?\\' gasped Pippin at the same \\nmoment. \\n\\nOver the lip of the little dell, on the side away from the hill, they \\nfelt, rather than saw, a shadow rise, one shadow or more than one. They \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstrained their eyes, and the shadows seemed to grow. Soon there could be no \\ndoubt: \\n\\nthree or four tall black figures were standing there on the slope, \\nlooking down on them. So black were they that they seemed like black holes \\nin the deep shade behind them. Frodo thought that he heard a faint hiss as \\nof venomous breath and felt a thin piercing chill. Then the shapes slowly \\nadvanced. \\n\\nTerror overcame Pippin and Merry, and they threw themselves flat on the \\nground. Sam shrank to Frodo\\'s side. Frodo was hardly less terrified than his \\ncompanions; he was quaking as if he was bitter cold, but his terror was \\nswallowed up in a sudden temptation to put on the Ring. The desire to do \\nthis laid hold of him, and he could think of nothing else. Fie did not forget \\nthe Barrow, nor the message of Gandalf; but something seemed to be \\ncompelling him to disregard all warnings, and he longed to yield. Not with \\nthe hope of escape, or of doing anything, either good or bad: he simply felt \\nthat he must take the Ring and put it on his finger. Fie could not speak. Fie \\nfelt Sam looking at him, as if he knew that his master was in some great \\ntrouble, but he could not turn towards him. He shut his eyes and struggled \\nfor a while; but resistance became unbearable, and at last he slowly drew \\nout the chain, and slipped the Ring on the forefinger of his left hand. \\n\\nImmediately, though everything else remained as before, dim and dark, \\nthe shapes became terribly clear. He was able to see beneath their black \\nwrappings. There were five tall figures: two standing on the lip of the \\ndell, three advancing. In their white faces burned keen and merciless eyes; \\nunder their mantles were long grey robes; upon their grey hairs were helms \\nof silver; in their haggard hands were swords of steel. Their eyes fell on \\nhim and pierced him, as they rushed towards him. Desperate, he drew his own \\nsword, and it seemed to him that it flickered red, as if it was a firebrand. \\n\\nTwo of the figures halted. The third was taller than the others: his hair \\nwas long and gleaming and on his helm was a crown. In one hand he held a \\nlong sword, and in the other a knife; both the knife and the hand that held \\nit glowed with a pale light. He sprang forward and bore down on Frodo. \\n\\nAt that moment Frodo threw himself forward on the ground, and he heard \\nhimself crying aloud: O Elbereth! Gilthoniel! At the same time he struck at \\nthe feet of his enemy. A shrill cry rang out in the night; and he felt a \\npain like a dart of poisoned ice pierce his left shoulder. Even as he \\nswooned he caught, as through a swirling mist, a glimpse of Strider leaping \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nout of the darkness with a flaming brand of wood in either hand. With a last \\neffort Frodo, dropping his sword, slipped the Ring from his finger and \\nclosed his right hand tight upon it. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 12 . Flight to the Ford \\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Frodo came to himself he was still clutching the Ring desperately. \\n\\nHe was lying by the fire, which was now piled high and burning brightly. His \\nthree companions were bending over him. \\'What has happened? Where is the \\npale king?\\' he asked wildly. They were too overjoyed to hear him speak to \\nanswer for a while; nor did they understand his question. At length he \\ngathered from Sam that they had seen nothing but the vague shadowy shapes \\ncoming towards them. Suddenly to his horror Sam found that his master had \\nvanished; and at that moment a black shadow rushed past him, and he fell. He \\nheard Frodo\\'s voice, but it seemed to come from a great distance, or from \\nunder the earth, crying out strange words. They saw nothing more, until they \\nstumbled over the body of Frodo, lying as if dead, face downwards on the \\ngrass with his sword beneath him. Strider ordered them to pick him up and \\nlay him near the fire, and then he disappeared. That was now a good while \\nago. \\n\\nSam plainly was beginning to have doubts again about Strider; but while \\nthey were talking he returned, appearing suddenly out of the shadows. They \\nstarted, and Sam drew his sword and stood over Frodo; but Strider knelt down \\nswiftly at his side. \\n\\n\\'I am not a Black Rider, Sam,\\' he said gently, \\'nor in league with \\nthem. I have been trying to discover something of their movements; but I \\nhave found nothing. I cannot think why they have gone and do not attack \\nagain. But there is no feeling of their presence anywhere at hand.\\' \\n\\nWhen he heard what Frodo had to tell, he became full of concern, and \\nshook his head and sighed. Then he ordered Pippin and Merry to heat as much \\nwater as they could in their small kettles, and to bathe the wound with it. \\n\\n\\'Keep the fire going well, and keep Frodo warm!\\' he said. Then he got up and \\nwalked away, and called Sam to him. \\'I think I understand things better \\nnow,\\' he said in a low voice. \\'There seem only to have been five of the \\nenemy. Why they were not all here, I don\\'t know; but I don\\'t think they \\nexpected to be resisted. They have drawn off for the time being. But not \\nfar, I fear. They will come again another night, if we cannot escape. They \\nare only waiting, because they think that their purpose is almost \\naccomplished, and that the Ring cannot fly much further. I fear, Sam, that \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthey believe your master has a deadly wound that will subdue him to their \\nwill. We shall see!\\' Sam choked with tears. \\'Don\\'t despair!\\' said Strider. \\n\\n\\'You must trust me now. Your Frodo is made of sterner stuff than I had \\nguessed, though Gandalf hinted that it might prove so. He is not slain, and \\nI think he will resist the evil power of the wound longer than his enemies \\nexpect. I will do all I can to help and heal him. Guard him well, while I am \\naway!\\' He hurried off and disappeared again into the darkness. \\n\\nFrodo dozed, though the pain of his wound was slowly growing, and a \\ndeadly chill was spreading from his shoulder to his arm and side. His \\nfriends watched over him, warming him, and bathing his wound. The night \\npassed slowly and wearily. Dawn was growing in the sky, and the dell was \\nfilling with grey light, when Strider at last returned. \\n\\n\\'Look!\\' he cried; and stooping he lifted from the ground a black cloak \\nthat had lain there hidden by the darkness. A foot above the lower hem there \\nwas a slash. \\'This was the stroke of Frodo\\'s sword,\\' he said. \\'The only hurt \\nthat it did to his enemy, I fear; for it is unharmed, but all blades perish \\nthat pierce that dreadful King. More deadly to him was the name of \\nElbereth.\\' \\n\\n\\'And more deadly to Frodo was this!\\' He stooped again and lifted up a \\nlong thin knife. There was a cold gleam in it. As Strider raised it they saw \\nthat near the end its edge was notched and the point was broken off. But \\neven as he held it up in the growing light, they gazed in astonishment, for \\nthe blade seemed to melt, and vanished like a smoke in the air, leaving only \\nthe hilt in Strider\\'s hand. \\'Alas!\\' he cried. \\'It was this accursed knife \\nthat gave the wound. Few now have the skill in healing to match such evil \\nweapons. But I will do what I can.\\' \\n\\nHe sat down on the ground, and taking the dagger -hilt laid it on his \\nknees, and he sang over it a slow song in a strange tongue. Then setting it \\naside, he turned to Frodo and in a soft tone spoke words the others could \\nnot catch. From the pouch at his belt he drew out the long leaves of a \\nplant. \\n\\n\\'These leaves,\\' he said, \\'I have walked far to find; for this plant \\ndoes not grow in the bare hills; but in the thickets away south of the Road \\nI found it in the dark by the scent of its leaves.\\' He crushed a leaf in his \\nfingers, and it gave out a sweet and pungent fragrance. \\'It is fortunate \\nthat I could find it, for it is a healing plant that the Men of the West \\nbrought to Middle-earth. Athelas they named it, and it grows now sparsely \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand only near places where they dwelt or camped of old; and it is not known \\nin the North, except to some of those who wander in the Wild. It has great \\nvirtues, but over such a wound as this its healing powers may be small.\\' \\n\\nHe threw the leaves into boiling water and bathed Frodo\\'s shoulder. The \\nfragrance of the steam was refreshing, and those that were unhurt felt their \\nminds calmed and cleared. The herb had also some power over the wound, for \\nFrodo felt the pain and also the sense of frozen cold lessen in his side; \\nbut the life did not return to his arm, and he could not raise or use his \\nhand. He bitterly regretted his foolishness, and reproached himself for \\nweakness of will; for he now perceived that in putting on the Ring he obeyed \\nnot his own desire but the commanding wish of his enemies. He wondered if he \\nwould remain maimed for life, and how they would now manage to continue \\ntheir journey. He fell too weak to stand. \\n\\nThe others were discussing this very question. They quickly decided to \\nleave Weathertop as soon as possible. \\'I think now,\\' said Strider, \\'that the \\nenemy has been watching this place for some days. If Gandalf ever came here, \\nthen he must have been forced to ride away, and he will not return. In any \\ncase we are in great peril here after dark, since the attack of last night, \\nand we can hardly meet greater danger wherever we go.\\' \\n\\nAs soon as the daylight was full, they had some hurried food and \\npacked. It was impossible for Frodo to walk, so they divided the greater \\npart of their baggage among the four of them, and put Frodo on the pony. In \\nthe last few days the poor beast had improved wonderfully; it already seemed \\nfatter and stronger, and had begun to show an affection for its new masters, \\nespecially for Sam. Bill Ferny\\'s treatment must have been very hard for the \\njourney in the wild to seem so much better than its former life. \\n\\nThey started off in a southerly direction. This would mean crossing the \\nRoad, but. it was the quickest way to more wooded country. And they needed \\nfuel; for Strider said that Frodo must be kept warm, especially at night, \\nwhile fire would be some protection for them all. It was also his plan to \\nshorten their journey by cutting across another great loop of the Road: east \\nbeyond Weathertop it changed its course and took a wide bend northwards. \\n\\nThey made their way slowly and cautiously round the south-western \\nslopes of the hill, and came in a little while to the edge of the Road. \\n\\nThere was no sign of the Riders. But even as they were hurrying across they \\nheard far away two cries: a cold voice calling and a cold voice answering. \\nTrembling they sprang forward, and made for the thickets that lay ahead. The \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nland before them sloped away southwards, but it was wild and pathless; \\nbushes and stunted trees grew in dense patches with wide barren spaces in \\nbetween. The grass was scanty, coarse, and grey; and the leaves in the \\nthickets were faded and falling. It was a cheerless land, and their journey \\nwas slow and gloomy. They spoke little as they trudged along. Frodo\\'s heart \\nwas grieved as he watched them walking beside him with their heads down, \\nand \\n\\ntheir backs bowed under their burdens. Even Strider seemed tired and \\nheavy-hearted. \\n\\nBefore the first day\\'s march was over Frodo\\'s pain began to grow again, \\nbut he did not speak of it for a long time. Four days passed, without the \\nground or the scene changing much, except that behind them Weathertop \\nslowly \\n\\nsank, and before them the distant mountains loomed a little nearer. Yet \\nsince that far cry they had seen and heard no sign that the enemy had marked \\ntheir flight or followed them. They dreaded the dark hours, and kept watch \\nin pairs by night, expecting at any time to see black shapes stalking in the \\ngrey night, dimly lit by the cloud- veiled moon; but they saw nothing, and \\nheard no sound but the sigh of withered leaves and grass. Not once did they \\nfeel the sense of present evil that had assailed them before the attack in \\nthe dell. It seemed too much to hope that the Riders had already lost their \\ntrail again. Perhaps they were waiting to make some ambush in a narrow \\nplace? \\n\\nAt the end of the fifth day the ground began once more to rise slowly \\nout of the wide shallow valley into which they had descended. Strider now \\nturned their course again north-eastwards, and on the sixth day they reached \\nthe top of a long slow-climbing slope, and saw far ahead a huddle of wooded \\nhills. Away below them they could see the Road sweeping round the feet of \\nthe hills; and to their right a grey river gleamed pale in the thin \\nsunshine. In the distance they glimpsed yet another river in a stony valley \\nhalf-veiled in mist. \\n\\n\"I am afraid we must go back to the Road here for a while,\\' said \\nStrider. \\'We have now come to the River Hoarwell, that the Elves call \\nMitheithel. It flows down out of the Ettenmoors, the troll-fells north of \\nRivendell, and joins the Loud water away in the South. Some call it the \\nGreyflood after that. It is a great water before it finds the Sea. There is \\nno way over it below its sources in the Ettenmoors, except by the Last \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBridge on which the Road crosses.\\' \\n\\n\\'What is that other river we can see far away there?\\' asked Merry. \\n\\n\\'That is Loudwater, the Bruinen of Rivendell,\\' answered Strider. \\'The \\nRoad runs along the edge of the hills for many miles from the Bridge to the \\nFord of Bruinen. But I have not yet thought how we shall cross that water. \\nOne river at a time! We shall be fortunate indeed if we do not find the Last \\nBridge held against us.\\' \\n\\nNext day, early in the morning, they came down again to the borders of \\nthe Road. Sam and Strider went forward, but they found no sign of any \\ntravellers or riders. Here under the shadow of the hills there had been some \\nrain. Strider judged that it had fallen two days before, and had washed away \\nall footprints. No horseman had passed since then, as far as he could see. \\n\\nThey hurried along with all the speed they could make, and after a mile \\nor two they saw the Last Bridge ahead, at the bottom of a short steep slope. \\nThey dreaded to see black figures waiting there, but they saw none. Strider \\nmade them take cover in a thicket at the side of the Road, while he went \\nforward to explore. \\n\\nBefore long he came hurrying back. \\'I can see no sign of the enemy,\\' he \\nsaid, \\'and I wonder very much what that means. But I have found something \\nvery strange.\\' \\n\\nHe held out his hand, and showed a single pale-green jewel. \\'I found it \\nin the mud in the middle of the Bridge,\\' he said. \\'It is a beryl, an \\nelf-stone. Whether it was set there, or let fall by chance, I cannot say; \\nbut it brings hope to me. I will take it as a sign that we may pass the \\nBridge; but beyond that I dare not keep to the Road, without some clearer \\ntoken.\\' \\n\\nAt once they went on again. They crossed the Bridge in safety, hearing \\nno sound but the water swirling against its three great arches. A mile \\nfurther on they came to a narrow ravine that led away northwards through the \\nsteep lands on the left of the Road. Here Strider turned aside, and soon \\nthey were lost in a sombre country of dark trees winding among the feet of \\nsullen hills. \\n\\nThe hobbits were glad to leave the cheerless lands and the perilous \\nRoad behind them; but this new country seemed threatening and unfriendly. As \\nthey went forward the hills about them steadily rose. Here and there upon \\nheights and ridges they caught glimpses of ancient walls of stone, and the \\nruins of towers: they had an ominous look. Frodo, who was not walking, had \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntime to gaze ahead and to think. He recalled Bilbo\\'s account of his journey \\nand the threatening towers on the hills north of the Road, in the country \\nnear the Troll\\'s wood where his first serious adventure had happened. Frodo \\nguessed that they were now in the same region, and wondered if by chance \\nthey would pass near the spot. \\n\\n\\'Who lives in this land?\\' he asked. \\'And who built these towers? Is \\nthis troll-country?\\' \\n\\n\\'No!\\' said Strider. \\'Trolls do not build. No one lives in this land. \\n\\nMen once dwelt here, ages ago; but none remain now. They became an evil \\npeople, as legends tell, for they fell under the shadow of Angmar. But all \\nwere destroyed in the war that brought the North Kingdom to its end. But \\nthat is now so long ago that the hills have forgotten them, though a shadow \\nstill lies on the land.\\' \\n\\n\\'Where did you learn such tales, if all the land is empty and \\nforgetful?\\' asked Peregrin. \\'The birds and beasts do not tell tales of that \\nson.\\' \\n\\n\\'The heirs of Elendil do not forget all things past,\\' said Strider; \\n\\n\\'and many more things than I can tell are remembered in Rivendell.\\' \\'Have \\nyou often been to Rivendell?\\' said Frodo. \\'I have,\\' said Strider. \\'I dwelt \\nthere once, and still I return when I may. \\n\\nThere my heart is; but it is not my fate to sit in peace, even in the \\nfair house of Elrond.\\' \\n\\nThe hills now began to shut them in. The Road behind held on its way to \\nthe River Bruinen, but both were now hidden from view. The travellers came \\ninto a long valley; narrow, deeply cloven, dark and silent. Trees with old \\nand twisted roots hung over cliffs, and piled up behind into mounting slopes \\nof pine-wood. \\n\\nThe hobbits grew very weary. They advanced slowly, for they had to pick \\ntheir way through a pathless country, encumbered by fallen trees and tumbled \\nrocks. As long as they could they avoided climbing for Frodo\\'s sake, and \\nbecause it was in fact difficult to find any way up out of the narrow dales. \\n\\nThey had been two days in this country when the weather turned wet. The wind \\nbegan to blow steadily out of the West and pour the water of the distant \\nseas on the dark heads of the hills in fine drenching rain. By nightfall \\nthey were all soaked, and their camp was cheerless, for they could not get \\nany fire to burn. The next day the hills rose still higher and steeper \\nbefore them, and they were forced to turn away northwards out of their \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncourse. Strider seemed to be getting anxious: they were nearly ten days out \\nfrom Weathertop, and their stock of provisions was beginning to run low. It \\nwent on raining. \\n\\nThat night they camped on a stony shelf with a rock -wall behind them, \\nin which there was a shallow cave, a mere scoop in the cliff. Frodo was \\nrestless. The cold and wet had made his wound more painful than ever, and \\nthe ache and sense of deadly chill took away all sleep. He lay tossing and \\nturning and listening fearfully to the stealthy night-noises: wind in chinks \\nof rock, water dripping, a crack, the sudden rattling fall of a loosened \\nstone. He felt that black shapes were advancing to smother him; but when he \\nsat up he saw nothing but the back of Strider sitting hunched up, smoking \\nhis pipe, and watching. He lay down again and passed into an uneasy dream, \\nin which he walked on the grass in his garden in the Shire, but it seemed \\nfaint and dim, less clear than the tall black shadows that stood looking \\nover the hedge. \\n\\nIn the morning he woke to find that the rain had stopped. The clouds \\nwere still thick, but they were breaking, and pale strips of blue appeared \\nbetween them. The wind was shifting again. They did not start early. \\nImmediately after their cold and comfortless breakfast Strider went off \\nalone, telling the others to remain under the shelter of the cliff, until he \\ncame back. He was going to climb up, if he could, and get a look at the lie \\nof the land. \\n\\nWhen he returned he was not reassuring. \\'We have come too far to the \\nnorth,\\' he said, \\'and we must find some way to turn back southwards again. \\n\\nIf we keep on as we are going we shall get up into the Ettendales far north \\nof Rivendell. That is troll-country, and little known to me. We could \\nperhaps find our way through and come round to Rivendell from the north; but \\nit would take too long, for I do not know the way, and our food would not \\nlast. So somehow or other we must find the Ford of Bruinen.\\' \\n\\nThe rest of that day they spent scrambling over rocky ground. They \\nfound a passage between two hills that led them into a valley running \\nsouth-east, the direction that they wished to take; but towards the end of \\nthe day they found their road again barred by a ridge of high land; its dark \\nedge against the sky was broken into many bare points like teeth of a \\nblunted saw. They had a choice between going back or climbing over it. \\n\\nThey decided to attempt the climb, but it proved very difficult. Before \\nlong Frodo was obliged to dismount and struggle along on foot. Even so they \\n\\n\\n\\n\\noften despaired of getting their pony up, or indeed of finding a path for \\nthemselves, burdened as they were. The light was nearly gone, and they were \\nall exhausted, when at last they reached the top. They had climbed on to a \\nnarrow saddle between two higher points, and the land fell steeply away \\nagain, only a short distance ahead. Frodo threw himself down, and lay on the \\nground shivering. His left arm was lifeless, and his side and shoulder felt \\nas if icy claws were laid upon them. The trees and rocks about him seemed \\nshadowy and dim. \\n\\n\\'We cannot go any further,\\' said Merry to Strider. \\'I am afraid this \\nhas been too much for Frodo. I am dreadfully anxious about him. What are we \\nto do? Do you think they will be able to cure him in Ri vendell, if we ever \\nget there?\\' \\n\\n\\'We shall see,\\' answered Strider. \\'There is nothing more that I can do \\nin the wilderness; and it is chiefly because of his wound that I am so \\nanxious to press on. But I agree that we can go no further tonight.\\' \\n\\n\\'What is the matter with my master?\\' asked Sam in a low voice, looking \\nappealingly at Strider. \\'His wound was small, and it is already closed. \\n\\nThere\\'s nothing to be seen but a cold white mark on his shoulder.\\' \\n\\n\\'Frodo has been touched by the weapons of the Enemy,\\' said Strider, \\n\\n\\'and there is some poison or evil at work that is beyond my skill to drive \\nout. But do not give up hope, Sam!\\' \\n\\nNight was cold up on the high ridge. They lit a small fire down under \\nthe gnarled roots of an old pine, that hung over a shallow pit: it looked as \\nif stone had once been quarried there. They sat huddled together. The wind \\nblew chill through the pass, and they heard the tree-tops lower down moaning \\nand sighing. Frodo lay half in a dream, imagining that endless dark wings \\nwere sweeping by above him, and that on the wings rode pursuers that sought \\nhim in all the hollows of the hill s. \\n\\nThe morning dawned bright and fair; the air was clean, and the light \\npale and clear in a rain- washed sky. Their hearts were encouraged, but (hey \\nlonged for the sun to warm their cold stiff limbs. As soon as it was light, \\nStrider took Merry with him and went to survey the country from the height \\nto the east of the pass. The sun had risen and was shining brightly when he \\nreturned with more comforting news. They were now going more or less in the \\nright direction. If they went on, down the further side of the ridge, they \\nwould have the Mountains on their left. Some way ahead Strider had caught a \\nglimpse of the Loudwater again, and he knew that, though it was hidden from \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nview, the Road to the Ford was not far from the River and lay on the side \\nnearest to them. \\n\\n\\'We must make for the Road again,\\' he said. \\'We cannot hope to find a \\npath through these hills. Whatever danger may beset it, the Road is our only \\nway to the Ford.\\' \\n\\nAs soon as they had eaten they set out again. They climbed slowly down \\nthe southern side of the ridge; but the way was much easier than they had \\nexpected, for the slope was far less steep on this side, and before long \\nFrodo was able to ride again. Bill Ferny\\'s poor old pony was developing an \\nunexpected talent for picking out a path, and for sparing its rider as many \\njolts as possible. The spirits of the party rose again. Even Frodo felt \\nbetter in the morning light, but every now and again a mist seemed to \\nobscure his sight, and he passed his hands over his eyes. \\n\\nPippin was a little ahead of the others. Suddenly he turned round and \\ncalled to them. \\'There is a path here!\\' he cried. \\n\\nWhen they came up with him, they saw that he had made no mistake: \\n\\nthere were clearly the beginnings of a path, that climbed with many \\nwindings out of the woods below and faded away on the hill-top behind. In \\nplaces it was now faint and overgrown, or choked with fallen stones and \\ntrees; but at one time it seemed to have been much used. It was a path made \\nby strong arms and heavy feet. Here and there old trees had been cut or \\nbroken down, and large rocks cloven or heaved aside to make a way. \\n\\nThey followed the track for some while, for it offered much the easiest \\nway down, but they went cautiously, and their anxiety increased as they came \\ninto the dark woods, and the path grew plainer and broader. Suddenly coming \\nout of a belt of fir-trees it ran steeply down a slope, and turned sharply \\nto the left round the comer of a rocky shoulder of the hill. When they came \\nto the comer they looked round and saw that the path ran on over a level \\nstrip under the face of a low cliff overhung with trees. In the stony wall \\nthere was a door hanging crookedly ajar upon one great hinge. \\n\\nOutside the door they all halted. There was a cave or rock-chamber \\nbehind, but in the gloom inside nothing could be seen. Strider, Sam, and \\nMerry pushing with all their strength managed to open the door a little \\nwider, and then Strider and Merry went in. They did not go far, for on the \\nfloor lay many old bones, and nothing else was to be seen near the entrance \\nexcept some great empty jars and broken pots. \\n\\n\\'Surely this is a troll-hole, if ever there was one!\\' said Pippin. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Come out, you two, and let us get away. Now we know who made the path - \\nand \\n\\nwe had better get off it quick.\\' \\n\\n\\'There is no need, I think,\\' said Strider, coining out. \\'It is \\ncertainly a troll-hole, but it seems to have been long forsaken. I don\\'t \\nthink we need be afraid. But let us go on down warily, and we shall see.\\' \\n\\nThe path went on again from the door, and turning to the right again \\nacross the level space plunged down a thick wooded slope. Pippin, not liking \\nto show Strider that he was still afraid, went on ahead with Merry. Sam and \\nStrider came behind, one on each side of Frodo\\'s pony, for the path was now \\nbroad enough for four or five hobbits to walk abreast. But they had not gone \\nvery far before Pippin came running back, followed by Merry. They both \\nlooked terrified. \\n\\n\\'There are trolls!\\' Pippin panted. \\'Down in a clearing in the woods not \\nfar below. We got a sight of them through the tree-trunks. They are very \\nlarge!\\' \\n\\n\\'We will come and look at them,\\' said Strider, picking up a stick. \\n\\nFrodo said nothing, but Sam looked scared. \\n\\nThe sun was now high, and it shone down through the half-stripped \\nbranches of the trees, and lit the clearing with bright patches of light. \\n\\nThey halted suddenly on the edge, and peered through the tree-trunks, \\nholding their breath. There stood the trolls: three large trolls. One was \\nstooping, and the other two stood staring at him. \\n\\nStrider walked forward unconcernedly. \\'Get up, old stone!\\' he said, and \\nbroke his stick upon the stooping troll. \\n\\nNothing happened. There was a gasp of astonishment from the hobbits, \\nand then even Frodo laughed. \\'Well!\\' he said. \\'We are forgetting our family \\nhistory! These must be the very three that were caught by Gandalf, \\nquarrelling over the right way to cook thirteen dwarves and one hobbit.\\' \\n\\n\\'I had no idea we were anywhere near the place!\\' said Pippin. He knew \\nthe story well. Bilbo and Frodo had told it often; but as a matter of fact \\nhe had never more than half believed it. Even now he looked at the stone \\ntrolls with suspicion, wondering if some magic might not suddenly bring them \\nto life again. \\n\\n\\'You are forgetting not only your family history, but all you ever knew \\nabout trolls,\\' said Strider. \\'It is broad daylight with a bright sun, and \\nyet you come back trying to scare me with a tale of live trolls waiting for \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nus in this glade! In any case you might have noticed that one of them has an \\nold bird\\'s nest behind his ear. That would be a most unusual ornament for a \\nlive troll!\\' \\n\\nThey all laughed. Frodo felt his spirits reviving: the reminder of \\nBilbo\\'s first successful adventure was heartening. The sun, too, was warm \\nand comforting, and the mist before his eyes seemed to be lifting a little. \\nThey rested for some time in the glade, and took their mid-day meal right \\nunder the shadow of the trolls\\' large legs. \\n\\n\\'Won\\'t somebody give us a bit of a song, while the sun is high?\\' said \\nMerry, when they had finished. \\'We haven\\'t had a song or a tale for days.\\' \\n\\n\\'Not since Weathertop,\\' said Frodo. The others looked at him. \\'Don\\'t \\nworry about me!\\' he added. \\'I feel much better, but I don\\'t think I could \\nsing. Perhaps Sam could dig something out of his memory.\\' \\n\\n\\'Come on, Sam!\\' said Merry. \\'There\\'s more stored in your head than you \\nlet on about.\\' \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know about that,\\' said Sam. \\'But how would this suit? It ain\\'t \\nwhat I call proper poetry, if you understand me: just a bit of nonsense. But \\nthese old images here brought it to my mind.\\' Standing up, with his hands \\nbehind his back, as if he was at school, he began to sing to an old tune. \\n\\nTroll sat alone on his seat of stone, \\n\\nAnd munched and mumbled a bare old bone; \\n\\nFor many a year he had gnawed it near, \\n\\nFor meat was hard to come by. \\n\\nDone by! Gum by! \\n\\nIn a case in the hills he dwelt alone, \\n\\nAnd meat was hard to come by. \\n\\nUp came Tom with his big boots on. \\n\\nSaid he to Troll: \\'Pray, what is yon? \\n\\nFor it looks like the shin o\\' my nuncle Tim, \\n\\nAs should be a-lyin \\' in graveyard. \\n\\nCaveyard! Paveyard! \\n\\nThis many a year has Tim been gone, \\n\\nAnd I thought he were lyin \\' in graveyard. \\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\'My lad, \\' said Troll, \\'this bone I stole. \\nBut what be bones that lie in a hole? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThy nuncle was dead as a lump o\\' lead, \\n\\nAfore I found his shinbone. \\n\\nTinbone! Thinbone! \\n\\nHe can spare a share for a poor old troll, \\n\\nFor he don\\'t need his shinbone. \\' \\n\\nSaid Tom: 7 don\\'t see why the likes o\\' thee \\nWithout axin \\' leave should go makin \\'free \\nWith the shank or the shin o\\' my father\\'s kin; \\nSo hand the old bone over! \\n\\nRover! Trover! \\n\\nThough dead he be, it belongs to he; \\n\\nSo hand the old bone over!\\' \\n\\n\\'For a couple o\\' pins,\\' says Troll, and grins, \\n\\'I\\'ll eat thee too, and gnaw thy shins. \\n\\nA bit o\\' fresh meal will go down sweet! \\n\\nI\\'ll try my teeth on thee now. \\n\\nHee now! See now! \\n\\nI\\'m tired o\\' gnawing old bones and skins; \\n\\nI\\'ve a mind to dine on thee now. \\' \\n\\nBut just as he thought his dinner was caught, \\nHe found his hands had hold of naught. \\n\\nBefore he could mind, Tom slipped behind \\nAnd gave him the boot to lam him. \\n\\nWarn him! Darn him! \\n\\nA bump o\\' the boot on the seat, Tom thought, \\nWould be the way to lam him. \\n\\nBut harder than stone is the flesh and bone \\nOf a troll that sits in the hills alone. \\n\\nAs well set your boot to the mountain\\'s root, \\nFor the seat of a troll don \\'t feel it. \\n\\nPeel it! Heal it! \\n\\nOld Troll laughed, when he heard Tom groan, \\nAnd he knew his toes could feel it. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTom\\'s leg is game, since home he came, \\n\\nAnd his bootless foot is lasting lame; \\n\\nBut Troll don\\'t care, and he\\'s still there \\n\\nWith the bone he boned from its owner. \\n\\nDoner! Boner! \\n\\nTroll\\'s old seat is still the same, \\n\\nAnd the bone he boned from its owner! \\n\\n\\'Well, that\\'s a warning to us all!\\' laughed Merry. \\'It is as well you \\nused a stick, and not your hand, Strider!\\' \\n\\n\\'Where did you come by that, Sam?\\' asked Pippin. \\'I\\'ve never heard \\nthose words before.\\' \\n\\nSam muttered something inaudible. \\'It\\'s out of his own head, of \\ncourse,\\' said Frodo. \\'I am learning a lot about Sam Gamgee on this journey. \\nFirst he was a conspirator, now he\\'s a jester. He\\'ll end up by becoming a \\nwizard - or a warrior!\\' \\n\\n\\'I hope not,\\' said Sam. \\'I don\\'t want to be neither!\\' \\n\\nIn the afternoon they went on down the woods. They were probably \\nfollowing the very track that Gandalf, Bilbo, and the dwarves had used many \\nyears before. After a few miles they came out on the top of a high bank \\nabove the Road. At this point the Road had left the Hoarwell far behind in \\nits narrow valley, and now clung close to the feet of the hills, rolling and \\nwinding eastward among woods and heather -covered slopes towards the Ford \\nand \\n\\nthe Mountains. Not far down the bank Strider pointed out a stone in the \\ngrass. On it roughly cut and now much weathered could still be seen \\ndwarf-runes and secret marks. \\n\\n\\'There!\\' said Merry. \\'That must be the stone that marked the place \\nwhere the trolls\\' gold was hidden. How much is left of Bilbo\\'s share, I \\nwonder, Frodo?\\' \\n\\nFrodo looked at the stone, and wished that Bilbo had brought home no \\ntreasure more perilous, nor less easy to pan with. \\'None at all,\\' he said. \\n\\n\\'Bilbo gave it all away. He told me he did not feel it was really his, as it \\ncame from robbers.\\' \\n\\nThe Road lay quiet under the long shadows of early evening. There was \\nno sign of any other travellers to be seen. As there was now no other \\npossible course for them to take, they climbed down the bank, and turning \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nleft went off as fast as they could. Soon a shoulder of the hills cut off \\nthe light of the fast westering sun. A cold wind flowed down to meet them \\nfrom the mountains ahead. \\n\\nThey were beginning to look out for a place off the Road, where they \\ncould camp for the night, when they heard a sound that brought sudden fear \\nback into their hearts: the noise of hoofs behind them. They looked back, \\nbut they could not see far because of the many windings and rollings of the \\nRoad. As quickly as they could they scrambled off the beaten way and up into \\nthe deep heather and bilberry brushwood on the slopes above, until they came \\nto a small patch of thick-growing hazels. As they peered out from among the \\nbushes, they could see the Road, faint and grey in the failing light, some \\nthirty feel below them. The sound of hoofs drew nearer. They were going \\nfast, with a light clippety-clippely-clip. Then faintly, as if it was blown \\naway from them by the breeze, they seemed to catch a dim ringing, as of \\nsmall bells tinkling. \\n\\nThat does not sound like a Black Rider\\'s horse!\\' said Frodo, listening \\nintently. The other hobbits agreed hopefully that it did not, but they all \\nremained full of suspicion. They had been in fear of pursuit for so long \\nthat any sound from behind seemed ominous and unfriendly. But Strider was \\nnow leaning forward, stooped to the ground, with a hand to his ear, and a \\nlook of joy on his face. \\n\\nThe light faded, and the leaves on the bushes rustled softly. Clearer \\nand nearer now the bells jingled, and clippety-clip came the quick trotting \\nfeet. Suddenly into view below came a white horse, gleaming in the shadows, \\nrunning swiftly. In the dusk its headstall flickered and flashed, as if it \\nwere studded with gems like living stars. The rider\\'s cloak streamed behind \\nhim, and his hood was thrown back; his golden hair flowed shimmering in the \\nwind of his speed. To Frodo it appeared that a white light was shining \\nthrough the form and raiment of the rider, as if through a thin veil. \\n\\nStrider sprang from hiding and dashed down towards the Road, leaping \\nwith a cry through the heather; but even before he had moved or called, the \\nrider had reined in his horse and halted, looking up towards the thicket \\nwhere they stood. When he saw Strider, he dismounted and ran to meet him \\ncalling out: Ai na vedui D(r)nadan! Mae govannen! His speech and clear \\nringing \\n\\nvoice left no doubt in their hearts: the rider was of the Elven-folk. No \\nothers that dwelt in the wide world had voices so fair to hear. But there \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nseemed to be a note of haste or fear in his call, and they saw that he was \\nnow speaking quickly and urgently to Strider. \\n\\nSoon Strider beckoned to them, and the hobbits left the bushes and \\nhurried down to the Road. \\'This is Glorfindel, who dwells in the house of \\nElrond,\\' said Strider. \\n\\n\\'Hail, and well met at last!\\' said the Elf-lord to Frodo. \\'I was sent \\nfrom Rivendell to look for you. We feared that you were in danger upon the \\nroad.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then Gandalf has reached Rivendell?\\' cried Frodo joyfully. \\n\\n\\'No. He had not when I departed; but that was nine days ago,\\' answered \\nGlorfindel. \\'Elrond received news that troubled him. Some of my kindred, \\njourneying in your land beyond the Baranduin,* learned that things were \\namiss, and sent messages as swiftly as they could. They said that the Nine \\nwere abroad, and that you were astray bearing a great burden without \\nguidance, for Gandalf had not returned. There are few even in Rivendell that \\ncan ride openly against the Nine; but such as there were, Elrond sent out \\nnorth, west, and south. It was thought that you might turn far aside to \\navoid pursuit, and become lost in the Wilderness. \\n\\n\\'It was my lot to take the Road, and I came to the Bridge of \\nMitheithel, and left a token there, nigh on seven days ago. Three of the \\nservants of Sauron were upon the Bridge, but they withdrew and I pursued \\nthem westward. I came also upon two others, but they turned away southward. \\nSince then I have searched for your trail. Two days ago I found it, and \\nfollowed it over the Bridge; and today I marked where you descended from the \\nhills again. But come! There is no time for further news. Since you are here \\nwe must risk the peril of the Road and go. There are five behind us, and \\nwhen they find your trail upon the Road they will ride after us like the \\nwind. And they are not all. Where the other four may be, I do not know. I \\nfear that we may find the Ford is already held against us.\\' \\n\\nWhile Glorfindel was speaking the shades of evening deepened. Frodo \\nfelt a great weariness come over him. Ever since the sun began to sink the \\nmist before his eyes had darkened, and he felt that a shadow was coming \\nbetween him and the faces of his friends. Now pain assailed him, and he felt \\ncold. He swayed, clutching at Sam\\'s arm. \\n\\n\\'My master is sick and wounded,\\' said Sam angrily. \\'He can\\'t go on \\nriding after nightfall. He needs rest.\\' \\n\\nGlorfindel caught Frodo as he sank to the ground, and taking him gently \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nin his arms he looked in his face with grave anxiety. \\n\\nBriefly Strider told of the attack on their camp under Weathertop, and \\nof the deadly knife. He drew out the hilt, which he had kept, and handed it \\nto the Elf. Glorfindel shuddered as he took it, but he looked intently at \\nit. \\n\\n\\'There are evil things written on this hilt,\\' he said; \\'though maybe \\nyour eyes cannot see them. Keep it, Aragorn, till we reach the house of \\nElrond! But be wary, and handle it as little as you may! Alas! the wounds of \\nthis weapon are beyond my skill to heal. I will do what I can - but all the \\nmore do I urge you now to go on without rest.\\' \\n\\nHe searched the wound on Frodo\\'s shoulder with his fingers, and his \\nface grew graver, as if what he learned disquieted him. But Frodo felt the \\nchill lessen in his side and arm; a little warmth crept down from his \\nshoulder to his hand, and the pain grew easier. The dusk of evening seemed \\nto grow lighter about him, as if a cloud had been withdrawn. He saw his \\nfriends\\' faces more clearly again, and a measure of new hope and strength \\nreturned. \\n\\n\\'You shall ride my horse,\\' said Glorfindel. \\'I will shorten the \\nstirrups up to the saddle-skins, and you must sit as tight as you can. But \\nyou need not fear: my horse will not let any rider fall that I command him \\nto bear. His pace is light and smooth; and if danger presses too near, he \\nwill bear you away with a speed that even the black steeds of the enemy \\ncannot rival.\\' \\n\\n\\'No, he will not!\\' said Frodo. \\'I shall not ride him, if I am to be \\ncarried off to Rivendell or anywhere else, leaving my friends behind in \\ndanger.\\' \\n\\nGlorfindel smiled. \\'I doubt very much,\\' he said, \\'if your friends would \\nbe in danger if you were not with them! The pursuit would follow you and \\nleave us in peace, I think. It is you, Frodo, and that which you bear that \\nbrings us all in peril.\\' \\n\\nTo that Frodo had no answer, and he was persuaded to mount Glorfindel\\'s \\nwhite horse. The pony was laden instead with a great part of the others\\' \\nburdens, so that they now marched lighter, and for a time made good speed; \\nbut the hobbits began to find it hard to keep up with the swift tireless \\nfeet of the Elf. On he led them, into the mouth of darkness, and still on \\nunder the deep clouded night. There was neither star nor moon. Not until the \\ngrey of dawn did he allow them to halt. Pippin, Merry, and Sam were by that \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntime nearly asleep on their stumbling legs; and even Strider seemed by the \\nsag of his shoulders to be weary. Frodo sat upon the horse in a dark dream. \\n\\nThey cast themselves down in the heather a few yards from the \\nroad-side, and fell asleep immediately. They seemed hardly to have closed \\ntheir eyes when Glorfindel, who had set himself to watch while they slept, \\nawoke them again. The sun had now climbed far into the morning, and the \\nclouds and mists of the night were gone. \\n\\n\\'Drink this!\\' said Glorfindel to them, pouring for each in turn a \\nlittle liquor from his silver-studded flask of leather. It was clear as \\nspring water and had no taste, and it did not feel either cool or warm in \\nthe mouth; but strength and vigour seemed to flow into all their limbs as \\nthey drank it. Eaten after that draught the stale bread and dried fruit \\n(which was now all that they had left) seemed to satisfy their hunger better \\nthan many a good breakfast in the Shire had done. \\n\\nThey had rested rather less than five hours when they took to the Road \\nagain. Glorfindel still urged them on, and only allowed two brief halts \\nduring the day\\'s march. In this way they covered almost twenty miles before \\nnightfall, and came to a point where the Road bent right and ran down \\ntowards the bottom of the valley, now making straight for the Bruinen. So \\nfar there had been no sign or sound of pursuit that the hobbits could see or \\nhear; but often Glorfindel would halt and listen for a moment, if they \\nlagged behind, and a look of anxiety clouded his face. Once or twice he \\nspoke to Strider in the elf-tongue. \\n\\nBut however anxious their guides might be, it was plain that the \\nhobbits could go no further that night. They were stumbling along dizzy with \\nweariness, and unable to think of anything but their feet and legs. Frodo\\'s \\npain had redoubled, and during the day things about him faded to shadows of \\nghostly grey. He almost welcomed the coming of night, for then the world \\nseemed less pale and empty. \\n\\nThe hobbits were still weary, when they set out again early next \\nmorning. There were many miles yet to go between them and the Ford, and \\nthey \\n\\nhobbled forward at the best pace they could manage. \\n\\n\\'Our peril will be greatest just ere we reach the river,\\' said \\nGlorfindel; \\'for my heart warns me that the pursuit is now swift behind us, \\nand other danger may be waiting by the Ford.\\' \\n\\nThe Road was still running steadily downhill, and there was now in \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nplaces much grass at either side, in which the hobbits walked when they \\ncould, to ease their tired feet. In the late afternoon they came to a place \\nwhere the Road went suddenly under the dark shadow of tall pine-trees, and \\nthen plunged into a deep cutting with steep moist walls of red stone. Echoes \\nran along as they hurried forward; and there seemed to be a sound of many \\nfootfalls following their own. All at once, as if through a gate of light, \\nthe Road ran out again from the end of the tunnel into the open. There at \\nthe bottom of a sharp incline they saw before them a long flat mile, and \\nbeyond that the Ford of Rivendell. On the further side was a steep brown \\nbank, threaded by a winding path; and behind that the tall mountains \\nclimbed, shoulder above shoulder, and peak beyond peak, into the fading sky. \\n\\nThere was still an echo as of following feet in the cutting behind \\nthem; a rushing noise as if a wind were rising and pouring through the \\nbranches of the pines. One moment Glorfindel turned and listened, then he \\nsprang forward with a loud cry. \\n\\n\\'Fly!\\' he called. \\'Fly! The enemy is upon us!\\' \\n\\nThe white horse leaped forward. The hobbits ran down the slope. \\nGlorfindel and Strider followed as rear -guard. They were only half way \\nacross the flat, when suddenly there was a noise of horses galloping. Out of \\nthe gate in the trees that they had just left rode a Black Rider. He reined \\nhis horse in, and halted, swaying in his saddle. Another followed him, and \\nthen another; then again two more. \\n\\n\\'Ride forward! Ride!\\' cried Glorfindel to Frodo. \\n\\nHe did not obey at once, for a strange reluctance seized him. Checking \\nthe horse to a walk, he turned and looked back. The Riders seemed to sit \\nupon their great steeds like threatening statues upon a hill, dark and \\nsolid, while all the woods and land about them receded as if into a mist. \\nSuddenly he knew in his heart that they were silently commanding him to \\nwait. Then at once fear and hatred awoke in him. His hand left the bridle \\nand gripped the hilt of his sword, and with a red flash he drew it. \\n\\n\\'Ride on! Ride on!\\' cried Glorfindel, and then loud and clear he called \\nto the horse in the elf-tongue: noro lim, noro lim, Asfaloth! \\n\\nAt once the white horse sprang away and sped like the wind along the \\nlast lap of the Road. At the same moment the black horses leaped down the \\nhill in pursuit, and from the Riders came a terrible cry, such as Frodo had \\nheard filling the woods with horror in the Eastfarthing far away. It was \\nanswered; and to the dismay of Frodo and his friends out from the trees and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nrocks away on the left four other Riders came flying. Two rode towards \\nFrodo: two galloped madly towards the Ford to cut off his escape. They \\nseemed to him to run like the wind and to grow swiftly larger and darker, as \\ntheir courses converged with his. \\n\\nFrodo looked back for a moment over his shoulder. He could no longer \\nsee his friends. The Riders behind were falling back: even their great \\nsteeds were no match in speed for the white elf-horse of Glorfindel. He \\nlooked forward again, and hope faded. There seemed no chance of reaching the \\nFord before he was cut off by the others that had lain in ambush. He could \\nsee them clearly now: they appeared to have cast aside their hoods and black \\ncloaks, and they were robed in white and grey. Swords were naked in their \\npale hands; helms were on their heads. Their cold eyes glittered, and they \\ncalled to him with fell voices. \\n\\nFear now filled all Frodo\\'s mind. He thought no longer of his sword. No \\ncry came from him. He shut his eyes and clung to the horse\\'s mane. The wind \\nwhistled in his ears, and the bells upon the harness rang wild and shrill. A \\nbreath of deadly cold pierced him like a spear, as with a last spurt, like a \\nflash of white fire, the elf-horse speeding as if on wings, passed right \\nbefore the face of the foremost Rider. \\n\\nFrodo heard the splash of water. It foamed about his feet. He felt the \\nquick heave and surge as the horse left the river and struggled up the stony \\npath. He was climbing the steep bank. He was across the Ford. \\n\\nBut the pursuers were close behind. At the top of the bank the horse \\nhalted and turned about neighing fiercely. There were Nine Riders at the \\nwater\\'s edge below, and Frodo\\'s spirit quailed before the threat of their \\nuplifted faces. He knew of nothing that would prevent them from crossing as \\neasily as he had done; and he felt that it was useless to try to escape over \\nthe long uncertain path from the Ford to the edge of Rivendell, if once the \\nRiders crossed. In any case he felt that he was commanded urgently to halt. \\nHatred again stirred in him, but he had no longer the strength to refuse. \\n\\nSuddenly the foremost Rider spurred his horse forward. It checked at \\nthe water and reared up. With a great effort Frodo sat upright and \\nbrandished his sword. \\n\\n\\'Go back!\\' he cried. \\'Go back to the Land of Mordor, and follow me no \\nmore! \\' His voice sounded thin and shrill in his own ears. The Riders \\nhalted, but Frodo had not the power of Bombadil. His enemies laughed at him \\nwith a harsh and chilling laughter. \\'Come back! Come back!\\' they called. \\'To \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMordor we will take you!\\' \\n\\n\\'Go back!\\' he whispered. \\n\\nThe Ring! The Ring!\\' they cried with deadly voices; and immediately \\ntheir leader urged his horse forward into the water, followed closely by two \\nothers. \\n\\n\\'By Elbereth and L(r)thien the Fair,\\' said Frodo with a last effort, \\nlifting up his sword, \\'you shall have neither the Ring nor me!\\' \\n\\nThen the leader, who was now half across the Ford, stood up menacing in \\nhis stirrups, and raised up his hand. Frodo was stricken dumb. He felt his \\ntongue cleave to his mouth, and his heart labouring. His sword broke and \\nfell out of his shaking hand. The elf-horse reared and snorted. The foremost \\nof the black horses had almost set foot upon the shore. \\n\\nAt that moment there came a roaring and a rushing: a noise of loud \\nwaters rolling many stones. Dimly Frodo saw the river below him rise, and \\ndown along its course there came a plumed cavalry of waves. White flames \\nseemed to Frodo to flicker on their crests and he half fancied that he saw \\namid the water white riders upon white horses with frothing manes. The three \\nRiders that were still in the midst of the Ford were overwhelmed: they \\ndisappeared, buried suddenly under angry foam. Those that were behind drew \\nback in dismay. \\n\\nWith his last failing senses Frodo heard cries, and it seemed to him \\nthat he saw, beyond the Riders that hesitated on the shore, a shining figure \\nof white light; and behind it ran small shadowy forms waving flames, that \\nflared red in the grey mist that was falling over the world. \\n\\nThe black horses were filled with madness, and leaping forward in \\nterror they bore their riders into the rushing flood. Their piercing cries \\nwere drowned in the roaring of the river as it carried them away. Then Frodo \\nfelt himself falling, and the roaring and confusion seemed to rise and \\nengulf him together with his enemies. He heard and saw no more. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* BOOK II * \\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 1 . Many Meetings \\n\\nFrodo woke and found himself lying in bed. At first he thought that he \\nhad slept late, after a long unpleasant dream that still hovered on the edge \\nof memory. Or perhaps he had been ill? But the ceiling looked strange; it \\nwas flat, and it had dark beams richly carved. He lay a little while longer \\nlooking at patches of sunlight on the wall, and listening to the sound of a \\nwaterfall. \\n\\n\\'Where am I, and what is the time?\\' he said aloud to the ceiling. \\'In \\nthe House of Elrond, and it is ten o\\'clock in the morning.\\' said a voice. \\n\\n\\'It is the morning of October the twenty -fourth, if you want to know.\\' \\n\\n\\'Gandalf!\\' cried Frodo, sitting up. There was the old wizard, sitting \\nin a chair by the open window. \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' he said, \\'I am here. And you are lucky to be here, too, after \\nall the absurd things you have done since you left home.\\' Frodo lay down \\nagain. He felt too comfortable and peaceful to argue, and in any case he did \\nnot think he would get the better of an argument. He was fully awake now, \\nand the memory of his journey was returning: the disastrous \\'short cut\\' \\nthrough the Old Forest the \\'accident\\' at The Prancing Pony ; and his madness \\nin putting on the Ring in the dell under Weathertop. While he was thinking \\nof all these things and trying in vain to bring his memory down to his \\narriving in Rivendell, there was a long silence, broken only by the soft \\npuffs of Gandalf s pipe, as he blew white smoke -rings out of the window. \\n\\n\\'Where\\'s Sam?\\' Frodo asked at length. \\'And are the others all right?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, they are all safe and sound,\\' answered Gandalf. \\'Sam was here \\nuntil I sent him off to get some rest, about half an hour ago.\\' \\n\\n\\'What happened at the Ford?\\' said Frodo. \\'It all seemed so dim somehow; \\nand it still does.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, it would. You were beginning to fade,\\' answered Gandalf. \\'The \\nwound was overcoming you at last. A few more hours and you would have \\nbeen \\n\\nbeyond our aid. But you have some strength in you, my dear hobbit! As you \\nshowed in the Barrow. That was touch and go: perhaps the most dangerous \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmoment of all. I wish you could have held out at Weathertop.\\' \\n\\n\\'You seem to know a great deal already,\\' said Frodo. \\'I have not spoken \\nto the others about the Barrow. At first it was too horrible; and afterwards \\nthere were other things to think about. How do you know about it?\\' \\n\\n\\'You have talked long in your sleep, Frodo,\\' said Gandalf gently, \\'and \\nit has not been hard for me to read your mind and memory. Do not worry! \\nThough I said \"absurd\" just now, I did not mean it. I think well of you-and \\nof the others. It is no small feat to have come so far, and through such \\ndangers, still bearing the Ring.\\' \\n\\n\\'We should never have done it without Strider,\\' said Frodo. \\'But we \\nneeded you. I did not know what to do without you.\\' \\n\\n\\'I was delayed,\\' said Gandalf, \\'and that nearly proved our ruin. And \\nyet I am not sure; it may have been better so.\\' \\n\\n\\'I wish you would tell me what happened!\\' \\n\\n\\'All in good time! You are not supposed to talk or worry about anything \\ntoday, by Elrond\\'s orders.\\' \\n\\n\\'But talking would stop me thinking and wondering, which are quite as \\ntiring,\\' said Frodo. \\'I am wide awake now, and I remember so many things \\nthat want explaining. Why were you delayed? You ought to tell me that at \\nleast.\\' \\n\\n\\'You will soon hear all you wish to know,\\' said Gandalf. \\'We shall have \\na Council, as soon as you are well enough. At the moment I will only say \\nthat I was held captive.\\' \\n\\n\\'You?\\' cried Frodo. \\n\\n\\'Yes, I, Gandalf the Grey,\\' said the wizard solemnly. \\'There are many \\npowers in the world, for good or for evil. Some are greater than I am. \\nAgainst some I have not yet been measured. But my time is coming. The \\nMorgul-lord and his Black Riders have come forth. War is preparing!\\' \\n\\n\\'Then you knew of the Riders already -before I met them?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, I knew of them. Indeed I spoke of them once to you; for the Black \\nRiders are the Ringwraiths, the Nine Servants of the Lord of the Rings. But \\nI did not know that they had arisen again or I should have fled with you at \\nonce. I heard news of them only after I left you in June; but that story \\nmust wait. For the moment we have been saved from disaster, by Aragorn.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Frodo, \\'it was Strider that saved us. Yet I was afraid of \\nhim at first. Sam never quite trusted him. I think, not at any rate until we \\nmet Glorfindel.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGandalf smiled. V I have heard all about Sam,\\' he said. \\'He has no more \\ndoubts now.\\' \\n\\n\\'I am glad,\\' said Frodo. \\'For I have become very fond of Strider. Well, \\nfond is not the right word. I mean he is dear to me; though he is strange, \\nand grim at times. In fact, he reminds me often of you. I didn\\'t know that \\nany of the Big People were like that. I thought, well, that they were just \\nbig, and rather stupid: kind and stupid like Butterbur; or stupid and wicked \\nlike Bill Ferny. But then we don\\'t know much about Men in the Shire, except \\nperhaps the Breelanders.\\' \\n\\n\\'You don\\'t know much even about them, if you think old Barliman is \\nstupid,\\' said Gandalf. \\'He is wise enough on his own ground. He thinks less \\nthan he talks, and slower; yet he can see through a brick wall in time (as \\nthey say in Bree). But there are few left in Middle-earth like Aragorn son \\nof Arathorn. The race of the Kings from over the Sea is nearly at an end. It \\nmay be that this War of the Ring will be their last adventure.\\' \\n\\n\\'Do you really mean that Strider is one of the people of the old \\nKings?\\' said Frodo in wonder. \\'I thought they had all vanished long ago. I \\nthought he was only a Ranger.\\' \\n\\n\\'Only a Ranger!\\' cried Gandalf. \\'My dear Frodo, that is just what the \\nRangers are: the last remnant in the North of the great people, the Men of \\nthe West. They have helped me before; and I shall need their help in the \\ndays to come; for we have reached Rivendell, but the Ring is not yet at \\nrest.\\' \\n\\n\\'I suppose not,\\' said Frodo. \\'But so far my only thought has been to \\nget here; and I hope I shan\\'t have to go any further. It is very pleasant \\njust to rest. I have had a month of exile and adventure, and I find that has \\nbeen as much as I want.\\' \\n\\nHe fell silent and shut his eyes. After a while he spoke again. \\'I have \\nbeen reckoning,\\' he said, \\'and I can\\'t bring the total up to October the \\ntwenty-fourth. It ought to be the twenty-first. We must have reached the \\nFord by the twentieth.\\' \\n\\n\\'You have talked and reckoned more than is good for you,\\' said Gandalf. \\n\\'How do the side and shoulder feel now?\\' \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know.\\' Frodo answered. \\'They don\\'t feel at all: which is an \\nimprovement, but\\'-- he made an effort-- \\'I can move my arm again a little. \\nYes, it is coming back to life. It is not cold,\\' he added, touching his left \\nhand with his right. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Good!\\' said Gandalf. \"It is mending fast. You will soon be sound \\nagain. Elrond has cured you: he has tended you for days, ever since you were \\nbrought in.\\' \\n\\n\\'Days?\\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'Well, four nights and three days, to be exact. The Elves brought you \\nfrom this where you lost count. We have been terribly anxious, and Sam has \\nhardly left your side, day or night, except to run messages. Elrond is a \\nmaster of healing, but the weapons of our Enemy are deadly. To tell you the \\ntruth, I had very little hope; for I suspected that there was some fragment \\nof the blade still in the closed wound. But it could not be found until last \\nnight. Then Elrond removed a splinter. It was deeply buried, and it was \\nworking inwards.\\' \\n\\nFrodo shuddered, remembering the cruel knife with notched blade that \\nhad vanished in Strider\\'s hands. \\'Don\\'t be alarmed!\\' said Gandalf. \\'It is \\ngone now. It has been melted. And it seems that Hobbits fade very \\nreluctantly. I have known strong warriors of the Big People who would \\nquickly have been overcome by that splinter, which you bore for seventeen \\ndays.\\' \\n\\n\\'What would they have done to me?\\' asked Frodo. \\'What were the Riders \\ntrying to do?\\' \\n\\n\\'They tried to pierce your heart with a Morgul-knife which remains in \\nthe wound. If they had succeeded, you would have become like they are, only \\nweaker and under their command. You would have became a wraith under \\nthe \\n\\ndominion of the Dark Lord; and he would have tormented you for trying to \\nkeep his Ring, if any greater torment were possible than being robbed of it \\nand seeing it on his hand.\\' \\n\\n\\'Thank goodness I did not realize the horrible danger!\\' said Frodo \\nfaintly. I was mortally afraid, of course; but if I had known more, I should \\nnot have dared even to move. It is a marvel that I escaped!\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, fortune or fate have helped you,\\' said Gandalf, \\'not to mention \\ncourage. For your heart was not touched, and only your shoulder was pierced; \\nand that was because you resisted to the last. But it was a terribly narrow \\nshave, so to speak. You were in gravest peril while you wore the Ring, for \\nthen you were half in the wraith- world yourself, and they might have seized \\nyou. You could see them, and they could see you.\\' \\n\\n\\'I know,\\' said Frodo. \\'They were terrible to behold! But why could we \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nall see their horses?\\' \\n\\n\\'Because they are real horses; just as the black robes are real robes \\nthat they wear to give shape to their nothingness when they have dealings \\nwith the living.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then why do these black horses endure such riders? All other animals \\nare terrified when they draw near, even the elf-horse of Glorfindel. The \\ndogs howl and the geese scream at them.\\' \\n\\n\\'Because these horses are born and bred to the service of the Dark Lord \\nin Mordor. Not all his servants and chattels are wraiths! There are ores and \\ntrolls, there are wargs and werewolves; and there have been and still are \\nmany Men, warriors and kings, that walk alive under the Sun, and yet are \\nunder his sway. And their number is growing daily.\\' \\n\\n\\'What about Rivendell and the Elves? Is Rivendell safe?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, at present, until all else is conquered. The Elves may fear the \\nDark Lord, and they may fly before him, but never again will they listen to \\nhim or serve him. And here in Rivendell there live still some of his chief \\nfoes: the Elven-wise, lords of the Eldar from beyond the furthest seas. They \\ndo not fear the Ringwraiths, for those who have dwelt in the Blessed Realm \\nlive at once in both worlds, and against both the Seen and the Unseen they \\nhave great power.\\' \\n\\n\\'I thought that I saw a white figure that shone and did not grow dim \\nlike the others. Was that Glorfindel then?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, you saw him for a moment as he is upon the other side: one of the \\nmighty of the Firstborn. Lie is an Elf-lord of a house of princes. Indeed \\nthere is a power in Rivendell to withstand the might of Mordor, for a while: \\nand elsewhere other powers still dwell. There is power, too, of another kind \\nin the Shire. But all such places will soon become islands under siege, if \\nthings go on as they are going. The Dark Lord is putting forth all his \\nstrength. \\n\\n\\'Still,\\' he said, standing suddenly up and sticking out his chin, while \\nhis beard went stiff and straight like bristling wire, \\'we must keep up our \\ncourage. You will soon be well, if I do not talk you to death. You are in \\nRivendell, and you need not worry about anything for the present.\\' \\n\\n\\'I haven\\'t any courage to keep up,\\' said Frodo, \\'but I am not worried \\nat the moment. Just give me news of my friends, and tell me the end of the \\naffair at the Ford, as I keep on asking, and I shall be content for the \\npresent. After that I shall have another sleep, I think; but I shan\\'t be \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nable to close my eyes until you have finished the story for me.\\' \\n\\nGandalf moved his chair to the bedside, and took a good look at Frodo. \\n\\nThe colour had come back to his face, and his eyes were clear, and fully \\nawake and aware. He was smiling, and there seemed to be little wrong with \\nhim. But to the wizard\\'s eye there was a faint change just a hint as it were \\nof transparency, about him, and especially about the left hand that lay \\noutside upon the coverlet. \\n\\n\\'Still that must be expected,\\' said Gandalf to himself. \\'He is not half \\nthrough yet, and to what he will come in the end not even Elrond can \\nforetell. Not to evil, I think. He may become like a glass filled with a \\nclear light for eyes to see that can.\\' \\n\\n\\'You look splendid,\\' he said aloud. \\'I will risk a brief tale without \\nconsulting Elrond. But quite brief, mind you, and then you must sleep again. \\nThis is what happened, as far as I can gather. The Riders made straight for \\nyou, as soon as you fled. They did not need the guidance of their horses any \\nlonger: you had become visible to them, being already on the threshold of \\ntheir world. And also the Ring drew them. Your friends sprang aside, off the \\nroad, or they would have been ridden down. They knew that nothing could save \\nyou, if the white horse could not. The Riders were too swift to overtake, \\nand too many to oppose. On foot even Glorfindel and Aragorn together could \\nnot with stand all the Nine at once. \\n\\n\\'When the Ring wraiths swept by, your friends ran up behind. Close to \\nthe Ford there is a small hollow beside the road masked by a few stunted \\ntrees. There they hastily kindled fire; for Glorfindel knew that a flood \\nwould come down, if the Riders tried to cross, and then he would have to \\ndeal with any that were left on his side of the river. The moment the flood \\nappeared, he rushed out, followed by Aragorn and the. others with flaming \\nbrands. Caught between fire and water, and seeing an Elf-lord revealed in \\nhis wrath, they were dismayed, and their horses were stricken with madness. \\nThree were carried away by the first assault of the flood; the others were \\nnow hurled into the water by their horses and overwhelmed.\\' \\n\\n\\'And is that the end of the Black Riders?\\' asked Frodo. \\n\\n\\'No,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Their horses must have perished, and without them \\nthey are crippled. But the Ringwraiths themselves cannot be so easily \\ndestroyed. However, there is nothing more to fear from them at present. Your \\nfriends crossed after the flood had passed; and they found you lying on your \\nface at the top of the bank, with a broken sword under you. The horse was \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstanding guard beside you. You were pale and cold, and they feared that you \\nwere dead, or worse. Elrond\\'s folk met them, carrying you slowly towards \\nRi vendell. \\' \\n\\n\\'Who made the flood?\\' asked Frodo. \\n\\n\\'Elrond commanded it,\\' answered Gandalf. \\'The river of this valley is \\nunder his power, and it will rise in anger when he has great need to bar the \\nFord. As soon as the captain of the Ringwraiths rode into the water the \\nflood was released. If I may say so, I added a few touches of my own: you \\nmay not have noticed, but some of the waves took the form of great white \\nhorses with shining white riders; and there were many rolling and grinding \\nboulders. For a moment I was afraid that we had let loose too fierce a \\nwrath, and the flood would get out of hand and wash you all away. There is \\ngreat vigour in the waters that come down from the snows of the Misty \\nMountains.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, it all comes back to me now,\\' said Frodo: \\'the tremendous \\nroaring. I thought I was drowning, with my friends and enemies and all. But \\nnow we are safe!\\' \\n\\nGandalf looked quickly at Frodo, but he had shut his eyes. \\'Yes, you \\nare all safe for the present. Soon there will be feasting and merrymaking to \\ncelebrate the victory at the Ford of Bruinen, and you will all be there in \\nplaces of honour.\\' \\n\\n\\'Splendid!\\' said Frodo. \\'It is wonderful that Elrond, and Glorfindel \\nand such great lords, not to mention Strider, should take so much trouble \\nand show me so much kindness.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, there are many reasons why they should,\\' said Gandalf, smiling. \\n\\n\\'I am one good reason. The Ring is another: you are the Ring-bearer. And you \\nare the heir of Bilbo, the Ring-finder.\\' \\n\\n\\'Dear Bilbo!\\' said Frodo sleepily. \\'I wonder where he is. I wish he was \\nhere and could hear all about it. It would have made him laugh, The cow \\njumped over the Moon! And the poor old troll!\\' With that he fell fast \\nasleep. \\n\\nFrodo was now safe in the Fast Homely House east of the Sea. That house \\nwas, as Bilbo had long ago reported, \\'a perfect house, whether you like food \\nor sleep, or story-telling or singing, or just sitting and thinking best, or \\na pleasant mixture of them all\\'. Merely to be there was a cure for \\nweariness, fear, and sadness. \\n\\nAs the evening drew on, Frodo woke up again, and he found that he no \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nlonger felt in need of rest or sleep, but had a mind for food and drink, and \\nprobably for singing and story-telling afterwards. He got out of bed and \\ndiscovered that his arm was already nearly as useful again as it ever had \\nbeen. He found laid ready clean garments of green cloth that fitted him \\nexcellently. Looking in a mirror he was startled to see a much thinner \\nreflection of himself than he remembered: it looked remarkably like the \\nyoung nephew of Bilbo who used to go tramping with his uncle in the Shire; \\nbut the eyes looked out at him thoughtfully. \\n\\n\\'Yes, you have seen a thing or two since you last peeped out of a \\nlooking-glass,\\' he said to his reflection. \\'But now for a merry meeting!\\' \\n\\nHe stretched out his arms and whistled a tune. \\n\\nAt that moment there was a knock on the door, and Sam came in. He ran \\nto Frodo and took his left hand, awkwardly and shyly. He stroked it gently \\nand then he blushed and turned hastily away. \\n\\n\\'Hullo, Sam!\\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'It\\'s warm!\\' said Sam. \\'Meaning your hand, Mr. Frodo. It has felt so \\ncold through the long nights. But glory and trumpets!\\' he cried, turning \\nround again with shining eyes and dancing on the floor. \\'It\\'s fine to see \\nyou up and yourself again, sir! Gandalf asked me to come and see if you were \\nready to come down, and I thought he was joking.\\' \\n\\n\\'I am ready,\\' said Frodo. \\'Let\\'s go and look for the rest of the \\nparty!\\' \\n\\n\\'I can take you to them, sir,\\' said Sam. \\'It\\'s a big house this, and \\nvery peculiar. Always a bit more to discover, and no knowing what you\\'ll \\nfind round a corner. And Elves, sir! Elves here, and Elves there! Some like \\nkings, terrible and splendid; and some as merry as children. And the music \\nand the singing-not that I have had the time or the heart for much listening \\nsince we got here. But I\\'m getting to know some of the ways of the place.\\' \\n\\n\\'I know what you have been doing, Sam,\\' said Frodo, taking his arm. \\n\\'But you shall be merry tonight, and listen to your heart\\'s content. Come \\non, guide me round the corners!\\' \\n\\nSam led him along several passages and down many steps and out into a \\nhigh garden above the steep bank of the river. He found his friends sitting \\nin a porch on the side of the house looking east. Shadows had fallen in the \\nvalley below, but there was still a light on the faces of the mountains far \\nabove. The air was warm. The sound of running and falling water was loud, \\nand the evening was filled with a faint scent of trees and flowers, as if \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsummer still lingered in Elrond\\'s gardens. \\n\\n\\'Hurray!\\' cried Pippin, springing up. \\'Here is our noble cousin! Make \\nway for Frodo, Lord of the Ring!\\' \\n\\n\\'Hush!\\' said Gandalf from the shadows at the back of the porch. \\'Evil \\nthings do not come into this valley; but all the same we should not name \\nthem. The Lord of the Ring is not Frodo, but the master of the Dark Tower of \\nMordor, whose power is again stretching out over the world! We are sitting \\nin a fortress. Outside it is getting dark.\\' \\n\\n\\'Gandalf has been saying many cheerful things like that,\\' said Pippin. \\n\\n\\'He thinks I need keeping in order. But it seems impossible, somehow, to \\nfeel gloomy or depressed in this place. I feel I could sing, if I knew the \\nright song for the occasion.\\' \\n\\n\\'I feel like singing myself,\\' laughed Frodo. \\'Though at the moment I \\nfeel more like eating and drinking!\\' \\n\\n\\'That will soon be cured,\\' said Pippin. \\'You have shown your usual \\ncunning in getting up just in time for a meal.\\' \\n\\n\\'More than meal! A feast!\\' said Merry. \\'As soon as Gandalf reported \\nthat you were recovered, the preparations began.\\' He had hardly finished \\nspeaking when they were summoned to the hall by the ringing of many bells. \\n\\nThe hall of Elrond\\'s house was filled with folk: Elves for the most \\npart, though there were a few guests of other sorts. Elrond, as was his \\ncustom, sat in a great chair at the end of the long table upon the dais; and \\nnext to him on the one side sat Glorfindel, on the other side sat Gandalf. \\n\\nFrodo looked at them in wonder, for he had never before seen Elrond, of \\nwhom so many tales spoke; and as they sat upon his right hand and his left, \\nGlorfindel, and even Gandalf, whom he thought he knew so well, were \\nrevealed \\n\\nas lords of dignity and power. Gandalf was shorter in stature than the other \\ntwo; but his long white hair, his sweeping silver beard, and his broad \\nshoulders, made him look like some wise king of ancient legend. In his aged \\nface under great snowy brows his dark eyes were set like coals that could \\nleap suddenly into fire. \\n\\nGlorfindel was tall and straight; his hair was of shining gold, his \\nface fair and young and fearless and full of joy; his eyes were bright and \\nkeen, and his voice like music; on his brow sat wisdom, and in his hand was \\nstrength. \\n\\nThe face of Elrond was ageless, neither old nor young, though in it was \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwritten the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful. His hair was dark \\nas the shadows of twilight, and upon it was set a circlet of silver; his \\neyes were grey as a clear evening, and in them was a light like the light of \\nstars. Venerable he seemed as a king crowned with many winters, and yet hale \\nas a tried warrior in the fulness of his strength. He was the Lord of \\nRivendell and mighty among both Elves and Men. \\n\\nIn the middle of the table, against the woven cloths upon the wall, \\nthere was a chair under a canopy, and there sat a lady fair to look upon, \\nand so like was she in form of womanhood to Elrond that Frodo guessed that \\nshe was one of his close kindred. Young she was and yet not so. The braids \\nof her dark hair were touched by no frost, her white arms and clear face \\nwere flawless and smooth, and the light of stars was in her bright eyes, \\ngrey as a cloudless night; yet queenly she looked, and thought and knowledge \\nwere in her glance, as of one who has known many things that the years \\nbring. Above her brow her head was covered with a cap of silver lace netted \\nwith small gems, glittering white; but her soft grey raiment had no ornament \\nsave a girdle of leaves wrought in silver. \\n\\nSo it was that Frodo saw her whom few mortals had yet seen; Arwen, \\ndaughter of Elrond, in whom it was said that the likeness of L(r)thien had \\ncome on earth again; and she was called Undumiel, for she was the Evenstar \\nof her people. Long she had been in the land of her mother\\'s kin, in Lurien \\nbeyond the mountains, and was but lately returned to Rivendell to her \\nfather\\'s house. But her brothers, Elladan and Elrohir, were out upon \\nerrantry: for they rode often far afield with the Rangers of the North, \\nforgetting never their mother\\'s torment in the dens of the ores. \\n\\nSuch loveliness in living thing Frodo had never seen before nor \\nimagined in his mind; and he was both surprised and abashed to find that he \\nhad a seat at Elrond\\' s table among all these folk so high and fair. Though \\nhe had a suitable chair, and was raised upon several cushions, he felt very \\nsmall, and rather out of place; but that feeling quickly passed. The feast \\nwas merry and the food all that his hunger could desire. It was some time \\nbefore he looked about him again or even turned to his neighbours. \\n\\nHe looked first for his friends. Sam had begged to be allowed to wait \\non his master, but had been told that for this time he was a guest of \\nhonour. Frodo could see him now, sitting with Pippin and Merry at the upper \\nend of one of the side-tables close to the dais. He could see no sign of \\nStrider. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNext to Frodo on his right sat a dwarf of important appearance, richly \\ndressed. His beard, very long and forked, was white, nearly as white as the \\nsnow-white cloth of his garments. He wore a silver belt, and round his neck \\nhung a chain of silver and diamonds. Frodo stopped eating to look at him. \\n\\n\\'Welcome and well met!\\' said the dwarf, turning towards him. Then he \\nactually rose from his seat and bowed. \\'Gluin at your service,\\' he said, and \\nbowed still lower. \\n\\n\\'Frodo Baggins at your service and your family\\'s,\\' said Frodo \\ncorrectly, rising in surprise and scattering his cushions. \\'Am I right in \\nguessing that you are the Gluin, one of the twelve companions of the great \\nThorin Oaken shield?\\' \\n\\n\\'Quite right,\\' answered the dwarf, gathering up the cushions and \\ncourteously assisting Frodo back into his seat. \\'And I do not ask, for I \\nhave already been told that you are the kinsman and adopted heir of our \\nfriend Bilbo the renowned. Allow me to congratulate you on your recovery.\\' \\n\\n\\'Thank you very much,\\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'You have had some very strange adventures, I hear,\\' said Gluin. \\'I \\nwonder greatly what brings four hobbits on so long a journey. Nothing like \\nit has happened since Bilbo came with us. But perhaps I should not inquire \\ntoo closely, since Elrond and Gandalf do not seem disposed to talk of this?\\' \\n\\n\\'I think we will not speak of it, at least not yet,\\' said Frodo \\npolitely. \\n\\nHe guessed that even in Elrond\\'s house the matter of the Ring was not \\none for casual talk; and in any case he wished to forget his troubles for a \\ntime. \\'But I am equally curious,\\' he added, \\'to learn what brings so \\nimportant a dwarf so far from the Lonely Mountain.\\' \\n\\nGluin looked at him. \\'If you have not heard, I think we will not speak \\nyet of that either. Master Elrond will summon us all ere long, I believe, \\nand then we shall all hear many things. But there is much else that may be \\ntold.\\' \\n\\nThroughout the rest of the meal they talked together, but Frodo \\nlistened more than he spoke; for the news of the Shire, apart from the Ring, \\nseemed small and far-away and unimportant, while Gluin had much to tell of \\nevents in the northern regions of Wilderland. Frodo learned that Grimbeorn \\nthe Old, son of Beorn, was now the lord of many sturdy men, and to their \\nland between the Mountains and Mirkwood neither ore nor wolf dared to go. \\n\\n\\'Indeed,\\' said Gluin, \\'if it were not for the Beornings, the passage \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfrom Dale to Rivendell would long ago have become impossible. They are \\nvaliant men and keep open the High Pass and the Ford of Carrock. But their \\ntolls are high,\\' he added with a shake of his head; \\'and like Beorn of old \\nthey are not over fond of dwarves. Still, they are trusty, and that is much \\nin these days. Nowhere are there any men so friendly to us as the Men of \\nDale. They are good folk, the Bardings. The grandson of Bard the Bowman \\nrules them, Brand son of Bain son of Bard. He is a strong king, and his \\nrealm now reaches far south and east of Esgaroth.\\' \\n\\n\\'And what of your own people?\\' asked Frodo. \\n\\n\\'There is much to tell, good and bad,\\' said Gluin; \\'yet it is mostly \\ngood: we have so far been fortunate, though we do not escape the shadow of \\nthese times. If you really wish to hear of us, I will tell you tidings \\ngladly. But stop me when you are weary! Dwarves\\' tongues run on when \\nspeaking of their handiwork, they say.\\' \\n\\nAnd with that Gluin embarked on a long account of the doings of the \\nDwarf-kingdom. He was delighted to have found so polite a listener; for \\nFrodo showed no sign of weariness and made no attempt to change the subject, \\nthough actually he soon got rather lost among the strange names of people \\nand places that he had never heard of before. He was interested, however, to \\nhear that Dbin was still King under the Mountain, and was now old (having \\npassed his two hundred and fiftieth year), venerable, and fabulously rich. \\n\\nOf the ten companions who had survived the Battle of Five Armies seven were \\nstill with him: Dwalin, Gluin, Dori, Nori, Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur. Bombur \\nwas now so fat that he could not move himself from his couch to his chair at \\ntable, and it took six young dwarves to lift him. \\n\\n\\'And what has become of Balin and Ori and Uin?\\' asked Frodo. \\n\\nA shadow passed over Gluin\\'s face. \\'We do not know,\\' he answered. \\'It \\nis largely on account of Balin that I have come to ask the advice of those \\nthat dwell in Rivendell. But tonight let us speak of merrier things!\\' \\n\\nGluin began then to talk of the works of his people, telling Frodo \\nabout their great labours in Dale and under the Mountain. \\'We have done \\nwell,\\' he said. \\'But in metalwork we cannot rival our fathers, many of \\nwhose, secrets are lost. We make good armour and keen swords, but we cannot \\nagain make mail or blade to match those that were made before the dragon \\ncame. Only in mining and building have we surpassed the old days. You should \\nsee the waterways of Dale, Frodo, and the fountains, and the pools! You \\nshould see the stone-paved roads of many colours! And the halls and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncavernous streets under the earth with arches carved like trees; and the \\nterraces and towers upon the Mountain\\'s sides! Then you would see that we \\nhave not been idle.\\' \\n\\n\\'I will come and see them, if ever I can,\\' said Frodo. \\'How surprised \\nBilbo would have been to see all the changes in the Desolation of Smaug!\\' \\n\\nGluin looked at Frodo and smiled. \\'You were very fond of Bilbo were you \\nnot?\\' he asked. \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' answered Frodo. 1 would rather see him than all the towers and \\npalaces in the world.\\' \\n\\nAt length the feast came to an end. Elrond and Arwen rose and went down \\nthe hall, and the company followed them in due order. The doors were thrown \\nopen, and they went across a wide passage and through other doors, and came \\ninto a further hall. In it were no tables, but a bright fire was burning in \\na great hearth between the carven pillars upon either side. \\n\\nFrodo found himself walking with Gandalf. \\'This is the Hall of Fire\\' \\nsaid the wizard. \\'Here you will hear many songs and tales-if you can keep \\nawake. But except on high days it usually stands empty and quiet, and people \\ncome here who wish for peace, and thought. There is always a fire here, all \\nthe year round, but there is little other light.\\' \\n\\nAs Elrond entered and went towards the seat prepared for him, elvish \\nminstrels began to make sweet music. Slowly the hall filled, and Frodo \\nlooked with delight upon the many fair faces that were gathered together; \\nthe golden firelight played upon them and shimmered in their hair. Suddenly \\nhe noticed, not far from the further end of the fire, a small dark figure \\nseated on a stool with his back propped against a pillar. Beside him on the \\nground was a drinking-cup and some bread. Frodo wondered whether he was \\nill \\n\\n(if people were ever ill in Ri vendell), and had been unable to come to the \\nfeast. His head seemed sunk in sleep on his breast, and a fold of his dark \\ncloak was drawn over his face. \\n\\nElrond went forward and stood beside the silent figure. \\'Awake little \\nmaster, he said, with a smile. Then, turning to Frodo, he beckoned to him. \\n\\'Now at last the hour has come that you have wished for, Frodo,\\' he said. \\n\\'Here is a friend that you have long missed.\\' \\n\\nThe dark figure raised its head and uncovered its face. \\n\\n\\'Bilbo!\\' cried Frodo with sudden recognition, and he sprang forward. \\n\\n\\'Hullo, Frodo my lad!\\' said Bilbo. \\'So you have got here at last. I \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhoped you would manage it. Well, well! So all this feasting is in your \\nhonour, I hear. I hope you enjoyed yourself?\\' \\n\\n\\'Why weren\\'t you there?\\' cried Frodo. \\'And why haven\\'t I been allowed \\nto see you before?\\' \\n\\n\\'Because you were asleep. I have seen a good deal of you. I have sat by \\nyour side with Sam each day. But as for the feast\\' I don\\'t go in for such \\nthings much now. And I had something else to do.\\' \\n\\n\\'What were you doing?\\' \\n\\n\\'Why, sitting and thinking. I do a lot of that nowadays, and this is \\nthe best place to do it in, as a rule. Wake up, indeed!\\' he said, cocking an \\neye at Elrond. There was a bright twinkle in it and no sign of sleepiness \\nthat Frodo could see. \\'Wake up! I was not asleep. Master Elrond. If you want \\nto know, you have all come out from your feast too soon, and you have \\ndisturbed me-in the middle of making up a song. I was stuck over a line or \\ntwo, and was thinking about them; but now I don\\'t suppose I shall ever get \\nthem right. There will be such a deal of singing that the ideas will be \\ndriven clean out of my head. I shall have to get my friend the D(r)nadan to \\nhelp me. Where is he?\\' \\n\\nElrond laughed. \\'He shall be found,\\' he said. \\'Then you two shall go \\ninto a corner and finish your task, and we will hear it and judge it before \\nwe end our merrymaking.\\' Messengers were sent to find Bilbo\\'s friend, though \\nnone knew where he was, or why he had not been present at the feast. \\n\\nIn the meanwhile Frodo and Bilbo sat side by side, and Sam came quickly \\nand placed himself near them. They talked together in soft voices, oblivious \\nof the mirth and music in the hall about them. Bilbo had not much to say of \\nhimself. When he had left Hobbiton he had wandered off aimlessly, along the \\nRoad or in the country on either side; but somehow he had steered all the \\ntime towards Ri vendell. \\'I got here without much adventure,\\' he said, \\'and \\nafter a rest I went on with the dwarves to Dale: my last journey. I shan\\'t \\ntravel again. Old Balin had gone away. Then I came back here, and here I \\nhave been. I have done this and that. I have written some more of my book. \\nAnd, of course, I make up a few songs. They sing them occasionally: just to \\nplease me, I think; for, of course, they aren\\'t really good enough for \\nRivendell. And I listen and I think. Time doesn\\'t seem to pass here: it just \\nis. A remarkable place altogether. \\n\\n\\'I hear all kinds of news, from over the Mountains, and out of the \\nSouth, but hardly anything from the Shire. I heard about the Ring, of \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncourse. Gandalf has been here often. Not that he has told me a great deal, \\nhe has become closer than ever these last few years. The D(r)nadan has told me \\nmore. Fancy that ring of mine causing such a disturbance! It is a pity that \\nGandalf did not find out more sooner. I could have brought the thing here \\nmyself long ago without so much trouble. I have thought several times of \\ngoing back to Hobbiton for it; but I am getting old, and they would not let \\nme: Gandalf and Elrond, I mean. They seemed to think that the Enemy was \\nlooking high and low for me, and would make mincemeat of me, if he caught \\nme \\n\\ntottering about in the Wild. \\n\\n\\'And Gandalf said: \"The Ring has passed on, Bilbo. It would do no good \\nto you or to others, if you tried to meddle with it again.\" Odd sort of \\nremark, just like Gandalf. But he said he was looking after you, so I let \\nthings be. I am frightfully glad to see you safe and sound.\\' He paused and \\nlooked at Frodo doubtfully. \\n\\n\\'Have you got it here?\\' he asked in a whisper. I can\\'t help feeling \\ncurious, you know, after all I\\'ve heard. I should very much like just to \\npeep at it again.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, I\\'ve got it,\\' answered Frodo, feeling a strange reluctance. \\'It \\nlooks just the same as ever it did.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, I should just like to see it for a moment,\\' said Bilbo. \\n\\nWhen he had dressed, Frodo found that while he slept the Ring had been \\nhung about his neck on a new chain, light but strong. Slowly he drew it out. \\nBilbo put out his hand. But Frodo quickly drew back the Ring. To his \\ndistress and amazement he found that he was no longer looking at Bilbo; a \\nshadow seemed to have fallen between them, and through it he found himself \\neyeing a little wrinkled creature with a hungry face and bony groping hands. \\nHe felt a desire to strike him. \\n\\nThe music and singing round them seemed to falter and a silence fell. \\nBilbo looked quickly at Frodo\\'s face and passed his hand across his eyes. \\'I \\nunderstand now,\\' he said. \\'Put it away! I am sorry: sorry you have come in \\nfor this burden: sorry about everything. Don\\'t adventures ever have an end? \\n\\nI suppose not. Someone else always has to carry on the story. Well, it can\\'t \\nbe helped. I wonder if it\\'s any good trying to finish my book? But don\\'t \\nlet\\'s worry about it now-let\\'s have some real News! Tell me all about the \\nShire!\\' \\n\\nFrodo hid the Ring away, and the shadow passed leaving hardly a shred \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nof memory. The light and music of Rivendell was about him again. Bilbo \\nsmiled and laughed happily. Every item of news from the Shire that Frodo \\ncould tell-aided and corrected now and again by Sam-was of the greatest \\ninterest to him, from the felling of the least tree to the pranks of the \\nsmallest child in Hobbiton. They were so deep in the doings of the Four \\nFarthings that they did not notice the arrival of a man clad in dark green \\ncloth. For many minutes he stood looking down at them with a smile. \\n\\nSuddenly Bilbo looked up. \\'Ah, there you are at last, D(r)nadan!\\' he \\ncried. \\n\\n\\'Strider!\\' said Frodo. \\'You seem to have a lot of names.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, Strider is one that I haven\\'t heard before, anyway,\\' said Bilbo. \\n\\n\\'What do you call him that for?\\' \\n\\n\\'They call me that in Bree,\\' said Strider laughing, \\'and that is how I \\nwas introduced to him.\\' \\n\\n\\'And why do you call him D(r)nadan?\\' asked Frodo. \\n\\n\\' The D(r)nadan,\\' said Bilbo. \\'Fie is often called that here. But I thought \\nyou knew enough Elvish at least to know d(r)n-udan: Man of the West, \\nN(r)menorean. But this is not the time for lessons!\\' He turned to Strider. \\n\\n\\'Where have you been, my friend? Why weren\\'t you at the feast? The Fady \\nArwen was there.\\' \\n\\nStrider looked down at Bilbo gravely. \\'I know,\\' he said. \\'But often I \\nmust put mirth aside. Elladan and Elrohir have returned out of the Wild \\nunlooked-for, and they had tidings that I wished to hear at once.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, my dear fellow,\\' said Bilbo, \\'now you\\'ve heard the news, can\\'t \\nyou spare me a moment? I want your help in something urgent. Elrond says \\nthis song of mine is to be finished before the end of the evening, and I am \\nstuck. Fet\\'s go off into a corner and polish it up!\\' \\n\\nStrider smiled. \\'Come then!\\' he said. \\'Fet me hear it!\\' \\n\\nFrodo was left to himself for a while, for Sam had fallen asleep. He \\nwas alone and felt rather forlorn\\' although all about him the folk of \\nRivendell were gathered. But those near him were silent, intent upon the \\nmusic of the voices and the instruments, and they gave no heed to anything \\nelse. Frodo began to listen. \\n\\nAt first the beauty of the melodies and of the interwoven words in \\nelven-tongues, even though he understood them little\\' held him in a spell, \\nas soon as he began to attend to them. Almost it seemed that the words took \\nshape, and visions of far lands and bright things that he had never yet \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nimagined opened out before him; and the firelit hall became like a golden \\nmist above seas of foam that sighed upon the margins of the world. Then the \\nenchantment became more and more dreamlike, until he felt that an endless \\nriver of swelling gold and silver was flowing over him, too multitudinous \\nfor its pattern to be comprehended; it became part of the throbbing air \\nabout him, and it drenched and drowned him. Swiftly he sank under its \\nshining weight into a deep realm of sleep. \\n\\nThere he wandered long in a dream of music that turned into running \\nwater, and then suddenly into a voice. It seemed to be the voice of Bilbo \\nchanting verses. Faint at first and then clearer ran the words. \\n\\nEdrendil was a mariner \\nthat tarried in Arvernien; \\nhe built a boat of timber felled \\nin Nimbrethil to journey in; \\nher sails he wove of silver fair, \\nof silver were her lanterns made, \\nher prow was fashioned like a swan, \\nand light upon her banners laid. \\n\\nIn panoply of ancient kings, \\nin chain, d rings he armoured him; \\nhis shining shield was scored with runes \\nto ward all wounds and harm from him; \\nhis bow was made of dragon-horn, \\nhis arrows shorn of ebony, \\nof silver was his habergeon, \\nhis scabbard of chalcedony; \\nhis sword of steel was valiant, \\nof adamant his helmet tall, \\nan eagle-plume upon his crest, \\nupon his breast an emerald. \\n\\nBeneath the Moon and under star \\nhe wandered far from northern strands, \\nbewildered on enchanted ways \\nbeyond the days of mortal lands. \\n\\nFrom gnashing of the Narrow Ice \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere shadow lies on frozen hills, \\nfrom nether heats and burning waste \\nhe turned in haste, and roving still \\non starless waters far astray \\nat last he came to Night of Naught, \\nand passed, and never sight he saw \\nof shining shore nor light he sought. \\n\\nThe winds of wrath came driving him, \\nand blindly in the foam he fled \\nfrom west to east and errandless, \\nunheralded he homeward sped. \\n\\nThere flying Elwing came to him, \\nand flame was in the darkness lit; \\nmore bright than light of diamond \\nthe fire upon her carcanet. \\n\\nThe Silmaril she bound on him \\nand crowned him with the living light \\nand dauntless then with burning brow \\nhe turned his prow; and in the night \\nfrom Otherworld beyond the Sea \\nthere strong and free a storm arose, \\na wind of power in Tarmenel; \\nby paths that seldom mortal goes \\nhis boat it bore with biting breath \\nas might of death across the grey \\nand long-forsaken seas distressed: \\nfrom east to west he passed away. \\n\\nThrough Evernight he back was borne \\non black and roaring waves that ran \\no\\'er leagues unlit and foundered shores \\nthat drowned before the Days began, \\nuntil he heard on strands of pearl \\nwhen ends the world the music long, \\nwhere ever foaming billows roll \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe yellow gold and jewels wan. \\n\\nHe saw the Mountain silent rise \\nwhere twilight lies upon the knees \\nof Valinor, and Eldamar \\nbeheld afar beyond the seas. \\n\\nA wanderer escaped from night \\nto haven white he came at last, \\nto Elvenhome the green and fair \\nwhere keen the air, where pale as glass \\nbeneath the Hill of Ilmarin \\na-glimmer in a valley sheer \\nthe lamplit towers ofTirion \\nare mirrored on the Shadowmere. \\n\\nHe tarried there from errantry, \\nand melodies they taught to him, \\nand sages old him marvels told, \\nand harps of gold they brought to him. \\nThey clothed him then in elven-white, \\nand seven lights before him sent, \\nas through the Calacirian \\nto hidden land forlorn he went. \\n\\nHe came unto the timeless halls \\nwhere shining fall the countless years, \\nand endless reigns the Elder King \\nin Ilmarin on Mountain sheer; \\nand words unheard were spoken then \\nof folk of Men and Elven-kin, \\nbeyond the world were visions showed \\nforbid to those that dwell therein. \\n\\nA ship then new they built for him \\nof mithril and of elven-glass \\nwith shining prow; no shaven oar \\nnor sail she bore on silver mast: \\nthe Silmaril as lantern light \\nand banner bright with living flame \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nto gleam thereon by Elbereth \\nherself was set, who thither came \\nand wings immortal made for him, \\nand laid on him undying doom, \\nto sail the shoreless skies and come \\nbehind the Sun and light of Moon. \\n\\nFrom Evereven\\'s lofty hills \\nwhere softly silver fountains fall \\nhis wings him bore, a wandering light, \\nbeyond the mighty Mountain Wall. \\n\\nFrom World\\'s End then he turned away \\nand yearned again to find afar \\nhis home through shadows journeying, \\nand burning as an island star \\non high above the mists he came, \\na distant flame before the Sun, \\na wonder ere the waking dawn \\nwhere grey the Norland waters run. \\n\\nAnd over Middle-earth he passed \\nand heard at last the weeping sore \\nof women and of elven-maids \\nin Elder Days, in years of yore, \\ngut on him mighty doom was laid, \\ntill Moon should fade, an orb,d star \\nto pass, and tarry never more \\non Hither Shores where mortals are; \\nfor ever still a herald on \\nan errand that should never rest \\nto bear his shining lamp afar, \\nthe Flammifer of Westernesse. \\n\\nThe chanting ceased. Frodo opened his eyes and saw that Bilbo was \\nseated on his stool in a circle of listeners, who were smiling and \\napplauding. \\n\\n\\'Now we had better have it again,\\' said an Elf. \\n\\nBilbo got up and bowed. \\'I am flattered, Lindir,\\' he said. \\'But it \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwould be too tiring to repeat it all.\\' \\n\\n\\'Not too tiring for you,\\' the Elves answered laughing. \\'You know you \\nare never tired of reciting your own verses. But really we cannot answer \\nyour question at one hearing!\\' \\n\\n\\'What!\\' cried Bilbo. \\'You can\\'t tell which parts were mine, and which \\nwere the D(r)nadan\\'s?\\' \\n\\n\\'It is not easy for us to tell the difference between two mortals\\' said \\nthe Elf. \\n\\n\\'Nonsense, Lindir,\\' snorted Bilbo. \\'If you can\\'t distinguish between a \\nMan and a Hobbit, your judgement is poorer than I imagined. They\\'re as \\ndifferent as peas and apples.\\' \\n\\n\\'Maybe. To sheep other sheep no doubt appear different,\\' laughed \\nLindir. \\'Or to shepherds. But Mortals have not been our study. We have other \\nbusiness.\\' \\n\\n\\'I won\\'t argue with you,\\' said Bilbo. \\'I am sleepy after so much music \\nand singing. I\\'ll leave you to guess, if you want to.\\' \\n\\nHe got up and came towards Frodo. \\'Well, that\\'s over,\\' he said in a low \\nvoice. \\'It went off better than I expected. I don\\'t often get asked for a \\nsecond hearing. What did you think of it?\\' \\n\\n\\'I am not going to try and guess,\\' said Frodo smiling. \\n\\n\\'You needn\\'t,\\' said Bilbo. \\'As a matter of fact it was all mine. Except \\nthat Aragorn insisted on my putting in a green stone. He seemed to think it \\nimportant. I don\\'t know why. Otherwise he obviously thought the whole thing \\nrather above my head, and he said that if I had the cheek to make verses \\nabout Edrendil in the house of Elrond, it was my affair. I suppose he was \\nright.\\' \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know,\\' said Frodo. \\'It seemed to me to fit somehow, though I \\ncan\\'t explain. I was half asleep when you began, and it seemed to follow on \\nfrom something that I was dreaming about. I didn\\'t understand that it was \\nreally you speaking until near the end.\\' \\n\\n\\'It is difficult to keep awake here, until you get used to it;\\' said \\nBilbo. \\'Not that hobbits would ever acquire quite the elvish appetite for \\nmusic and poetry and tales. They seem to like them as much as food, or more. \\nThey will be going on for a long time yet. What do you say to slipping off \\nfor some more quiet talk?\\' \\n\\n\\'Can we?\\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'Of course. This is merrymaking not business. Come and go as you like, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nas long as you don\\'t make a noise.\\' \\n\\nThey got up and withdrew quietly into the shadows, and made for the \\ndoors. Sam they left behind, fast asleep still with a smile on his face. In \\nspite of his delight in Bilbo\\'s company Frodo felt a tug of regret as they \\npassed out of the Hall of Fire. Even as they stepped over the threshold a \\nsingle clear voice rose in song. \\n\\nA Elbereth Gilthoniel, \\nsilivren penna mnriel \\no menel aglar elenath! \\n\\nNa-chaered palan-dnriel \\no galadhremmin ennorath, \\n\\nFanuilos, le linnathon \\nnef aear, sn nef aearon! \\n\\nFrodo halted for a moment, looking back. Elrond was in his chair and \\nthe fire was on his face like summer -light upon the trees. Near him sat the \\nLady Arwen. To his surprise Frodo saw that Aragorn stood beside her; his \\ndark cloak was thrown back, and he seemed to be clad in elven-mail, and a \\nstar shone on his breast. They spoke together, and then suddenly it seemed \\nto Frodo that Arwen turned towards him, and the light of her eyes fell on \\nhim from afar and pierced his heart. \\n\\nHe stood still enchanted, while the sweet syllables of the elvish song \\nfell like clear jewels of blended word and melody. \\' It is a song to \\nElbereth,\\' said Bilbo. \\'They will sing that, and other songs of the Blessed \\nRealm, many times tonight. Come on!\\' \\n\\nHe led Frodo back to his own little room. It opened on to the gar dens \\nand looked south across the ravine of the Bruinen. There they sat for some \\nwhile, looking through the window at the bright stars above the \\nsteep-climbing woods, and talking softly. They spoke no more of the small \\nnews of the Shire far away, nor of the dark shadows and perils that \\nencompassed them, but of the fair things they had seen in the world \\ntogether, of the Elves, of the stars, of trees, and the gentle fall of the \\nbright year in the woods. \\n\\nAt last there came a knock on the door. \\'Begging your pardon,\\' said \\nSam, putting in his head, \\'but I was just wondering if you would be wanting \\nanything.\\' \\n\\n\\'And begging yours, Sam Gamgee,\\' replied Bilbo. \\'I guess you mean that \\nit is time your master went to bed.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Well, sir, there is a Council early tomorrow, I hear and he only got \\nup today for the first time.\\' \\n\\n\\'Quite right, Sam,\\' laughed Bilbo. \\'You can trot off and tell Gandalf \\nthat he has gone to bed. Good night, Frodo! Bless me, but it has been good \\nto see you again! There are no folk like hobbits after all for a real good \\ntalk. I am getting very old, and I began to wonder if I should ever live to \\nsee your chapters of our story. Good night! I\\'ll take a walk, I think, and \\nlook at the stars of Elbereth in the garden. Sleep well!\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 2 . The Council of Elrond \\n\\n\\n\\nNext day Frodo woke early, feeling refreshed and well. He walked along \\nthe terraces above the loud-flowing Bruinen and watched the pale, cool sun \\nrise above the far mountains, and shine down. Slanting through the thin \\nsilver mist; the dew upon the yellow leaves was glimmering, and the woven \\nnets of gossamer twinkled on every bush. Sam walked beside him, saying \\nnothing, but sniffing the air, and looking every now and again with wonder \\nin his eyes at the great heights in the East. The snow was white upon their \\npeaks. \\n\\nOn a seat cut in the stone beside a turn in the path they came upon \\nGandalf and Bilbo deep in talk. \\'Hullo! Good morning!\\' said Bilbo. \\'Feel \\nready for the great council?\\' \\n\\n\\'I feel ready for anything,\\' answered Frodo. \\'But most of all I should \\nlike to go walking today and explore the valley. I should like to get into \\nthose pine- woods up there.\\' He pointed away far up the side of Rivendell to \\nthe north. \\n\\n\\'You may have a chance later,\\' said Gandalf. \\'But we cannot make any \\nplans yet. There is much to hear and decide today.\\' \\n\\nSuddenly as they were talking a single clear bell rang out. \\'That is \\nthe warning bell for the Council of Elrond,\\' cried Gandalf. \\'Come along now! \\nBoth you and Bilbo are wanted.\\' \\n\\nFrodo and Bilbo followed the wizard quickly along the winding path back \\nto the house; behind them, uninvited and for the moment forgotten, trotted \\nSam. \\n\\nGandalf led them to the porch where Frodo had found his friends the \\nevening before. The light of the clear autumn morning was now glowing in the \\nvalley. The noise of bubbling waters came up from the foaming river-bed. \\nBirds were singing, and a wholesome peace lay on the land. To Frodo his \\ndangerous flight, and the rumours of the darkness growing in the world \\noutside, already seemed only the memories of a troubled dream; but the faces \\nthat were turned to meet them as they entered were grave. \\n\\nElrond was there, and several others were seated in silence about him. \\nFrodo saw Glorfindel and Gluin; and in a corner alone Strider was sitting, \\nclad in his old travel-worn clothes again. Elrond drew Frodo to a seat by \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhis side, and presented him to the company, saying: \\n\\n\\'Here, my friends is the hobbit, Frodo son of Drogo. Few have ever come \\nhither through greater peril or on an errand more urgent.\\' \\n\\nHe then pointed out and named those whom Frodo had not met before. \\nThere was a younger dwarf at Gluin\\'s side: his son Gimli. Beside Glorfindel \\nthere were several other counsellors of Elrond\\'s household, of whom Erestor \\nwas the chief; and with him was Galdor, an Elf from the Grey Havens who had \\ncome on an errand from Cnrdan the Shipwright. There was also a strange Elf \\nclad in green and brown, Legolas, a messenger from his father, Thranduil, \\nthe King of the Elves of Northern Mirkwood. And seated a little apart was a \\ntall man with a fair and noble face, dark-haired and grey-eyed, proud and \\nstern of glance. \\n\\nHe was cloaked and booted as if for a journey on horseback; and indeed \\nthough his garments were rich, and his cloak was lined with fur, they were \\nstained with long travel. He had a collar of silver in which a single white \\nstone was set; his locks were shorn about his shoulders. On a baldric he \\nwore a great horn tipped with silver that now was laid upon his knees. He \\ngazed at Frodo and Bilbo with sudden wonder. \\n\\n\\'Here,\\' said Elrond, turning to Gandalf, \\'is Boromir, a man from the \\nSouth. He arrived in the grey morning, and seeks for counsel. I have bidden \\nhim to be present, for here his questions will be answered.\\' \\n\\nNot all that was spoken and debated in the Council need now be told. \\nMuch was said of events in the world outside, especially in the South, and \\nin the wide lands east of the Mountains. Of these things Frodo had already \\nheard many rumours; but the tale of Gluin was new to him, and when the dwarf \\nspoke he listened attentively. It appeared that amid the splendour of their \\nworks of hand the hearts of the Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were \\ntroubled. \\n\\n\\'It is now many years ago,\\' said Gluin, \\'that a shadow of disquiet fell \\nupon our people. Whence it came we did not at first perceive. Words began to \\nbe whispered in secret-: it was said that we were hemmed in a narrow place, \\nand that greater wealth and splendour would be found in a wider world. Some \\nspoke of Moria: the mighty works of our fathers that are called in our own \\ntongue Khazad-dym; and they declared that now at last we had the power and \\nnumbers to return.\\' \\n\\nGluin sighed. \\'Moria! Moria! Wonder of the Northern world! Too deep we \\ndelved there, and woke the nameless fear. Long have its vast mansions lain \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nempty since the children of Durin fled. But now we spoke of it again with \\nlonging, and yet with dread; for no dwarf has dared to pass the doors of \\nKhazad-dym for many lives of kings, save Thrur only, and he perished. At \\nlast, however, Balin listened to the whispers, and resolved to go; and \\nthough Dbin did not give leave willingly, he took with him Ori and Uin and \\nmany of our folk, and they went away south. \\n\\n\"That was nigh on thirty years ago. For a while we had news and it \\nseemed good: messages reported that Moria had been entered and a great work \\nbegun there. Then there was silence, and no word has ever come from Moria \\nsince. \\n\\n\"Then about a year ago a messenger came to Dbin, but not from \\nMoria -from Mordor: a horseman in the night, who called Dbin to his gate. The \\nLord Sauron the Great, so he said, wished for our friendship. Rings he would \\ngive for it, such as he gave of old. And he asked urgently concerning \\nhobbits, of what kind they were, and where they dwelt. \"For Sauron knows,\" \\nsaid he, \"that one of these was known to you on a time.\" \\n\\n\\'At this we were greatly troubled, and we gave no answer. And then his \\nfell voice was lowered, and he would have sweetened it if he could. \"As a \\nsmall token only of your friendship Sauron asks this,\" he said: \"that you \\nshould find this thief,\" such was his word, \"and get from him, willing or \\nno, a little ring, the least of rings, that once he stole. It is but a \\ntrifle that Sauron fancies, and an earnest of your good will. Find it, and \\nthree rings that the Dwarf sires possessed of old shall be returned to you, \\nand the realm of Moria shall be yours for ever. Find only news of the thief, \\nwhether he still lives and where, and you shall have great reward and \\nlasting friendship from the Lord. Refuse, and things will not seem so well. \\n\\nDo you refuse?\" \\n\\n\\'At that his breath came like the hiss of snakes, and all who stood by \\nshuddered, but Dbin said: \"I say neither yea nor nay. I must consider this \\nmessage and what it means under its fair cloak.\" \\n\\n\\' \"Consider well, but not too long,\" said he. \\n\\n\" \"The time of my thought is my own to spend,\" answered Dbin. \\n\\n\\' \"For the present,\" said he, and rode into the darkness. \\n\\n\\'Heavy have the hearts of our chieftains been since that night. We \\nneeded not the fell voice of the messenger to warn us that his words held \\nboth menace and deceit; for we knew already that the power that has \\nre-entered Mordor has not changed, and ever it betrayed us of old. Twice the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmessenger has returned, and has gone unanswered. The third and last time, so \\nhe says, is soon to come, before the ending of the year. \\n\\n\\'And so I have been sent at last by Dbin to warn Bilbo that he is \\nsought by the Enemy, and to learn, if may be, why he desires this ring, this \\nleast of rings. Also we crave the advice of Elrond. For the Shadow grows and \\ndraws nearer. We discover that messengers have come also to King Brand in \\nDale, and that he is afraid. We fear that he may yield. Already war is \\ngathering on his eastern borders. If we make no answer, the Enemy may move \\nMen of his rule to assail King Brand, and Dbin also.\\' \\n\\n\\'You have done well to come,\\' said Elrond. \\'You will hear today all \\nthat you need in order to understand the purposes of the Enemy. There is \\nnaught that you can do, other than to resist, with hope or without it. But \\nyou do not stand alone. You will learn that your trouble is but part of the \\ntrouble of all the western world. The Ring ! What shall we do with the Ring, \\nthe least of rings, the trifle that Sauron fancies? That is the doom that we \\nmust deem. \\n\\n\\'That is the purpose for which you are called hither. Called, I say. \\nthough I have not called you to me, strangers from distant lands. You have \\ncome and are here met, in this very nick of time, by chance as it may seem. \\n\\nYet it is not so. Believe rather that it is so ordered that we, who sit \\nhere, and none others, must now find counsel for the peril of the world. \\n\\n\\'Now, therefore, things shall be openly spoken that have been hidden \\nfrom all but a few until this day. And first, so that all may understand \\nwhat is the peril, the Tale of the Ring shall be told from the beginning \\neven to this present. And I will begin that tale, though others shall end \\nit.\\' \\n\\nThen all listened while Elrond in his clear voice spoke of Sauron and \\nthe Rings of Power, and their forging in the Second Age of the world long \\nago. A part of his tale was known to some there, but the full tale to none, \\nand many eyes were turned t= Elrond in fear and wonder as he told of the \\nElven-smiths of Eregion and their friendship with Moria, and their eagerness \\nfor knowledge, by which Sauron ensnared them. For in that time he was not \\nyet evil to behold, and they received his aid and grew mighty in craft, \\nwhereas he learned all their secrets, and betrayed them, and forged secretly \\nin the Mountain of Fire the One Ring to be their master. But Celebrimbor was \\naware of him, and hid the Three which he had made; and there was war, and \\nthe land was laid waste, and the gate of Moria was shut. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThen through all the years that followed he traced the Ring; but since \\nthat history is elsewhere recounted, even as Elrond himself set it down in \\nhis books of lore, it is not here recalled. For it is a long tale, full of \\ndeeds great and terrible, and briefly though Elrond spoke, the sun rode up \\nthe sky, and the morning was passing ere he ceased. \\n\\nOf N(r)menor he spoke, its glory and its fall, and the return of the \\nKings of Men to Middle-earth out of the deeps of the Sea, borne upon the \\nwings of storm. Then Elendil the Tall and his mighty sons, Isildur and \\nAnbrion, became great lords; and the North-realm they made in Arnor, and the \\nSouth-realm in Gondor above the mouths of Anduin. But Sauron of Mordor \\nassailed them, and they made the Last Alliance of Elves and Men, and the \\nhosts of Gil-galad and Elendil were mustered in Arnor. \\n\\nThereupon Elrond paused a while and sighed. \\'I remember well the \\nsplendour of their banners,\\' he said. v It recalled to me the glory of the \\nElder Days and the hosts of Beleriand, so many great princes and captains \\nwere assembled. And yet not so many, nor so fair, as when Thangorodrim was \\nbroken, and the Elves deemed that evil was ended for ever, and it was not \\nso.\\' \\n\\n\\'You remember?\\' said Frodo, speaking his thought aloud in his \\nastonishment. \\'But I thought,\\' he stammered as Elrond turned towards him, \\'I \\nthought that the fall of Gil-galad was a long age ago.\\' \\n\\n\\'So it was indeed,\\' answered Elrond gravely. \\'But my memory reaches \\nback even to the Elder Days. Edrendil was my sire, who was born in Gondolin \\nbefore its fall; and my mother was Elwing, daughter of Dior, son of L(r)thien \\nof Doriath. I have seen three ages in the West of the world, and many \\ndefeats, and many fruitless victories. \\n\\n\\'I was the herald of Gil-galad and marched with his host. I was at the \\nBattle of Dagorlad before the Black Gate of Mordor, where we had the \\nmastery: for the Spear of Gil-galad and the Sword of Elendil, Aiglos and \\nNarsil, none could withstand. I beheld the last combat on the slopes of \\nOrodruin, where Gil-galad died, and Elendil fell, and Narsil broke beneath \\nhim; but Sauron himself was overthrown, and Isildur cut the Ring from his \\nhand with the hilt-shard of his father\\'s sword, and took it for his own.\\' \\n\\nAt this the stranger, Boromir, broke in. \\'So that is what became of the \\nRing!\\' he cried. \\'If ever such a tale was told in the South, it has long \\nbeen forgotten. I have heard of the Great Ring of him that we do not name; \\nbut we believed that it perished from the world in the ruin of his first \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nrealm. Isildur took it! That is tidings indeed.\\' \\n\\n\\'Alas! yes,\\' said Elrond. \\'Isildur took it, as should not have been. It \\nshould have been cast then into Orodruin\\'s fire nigh at hand where it was \\nmade. But few marked what Isildur did. He alone stood by his father in that \\nlast mortal contest; and by Gil-galad only Cnrdan stood, and I. But Isildur \\nwould not listen to our counsel. \\n\\n\\' \"This I will have as weregild for my father, and my brother,\" he \\nsaid; and therefore whether we would or no, he took it to treasure it. But \\nsoon he was betrayed by it to his death; and so it is named in the North \\nIsildur\\'s Bane. Yet death maybe was better than what else might have \\nbefallen him. \\n\\n\\'Only to the North did these tidings come, and only to a few. Small \\nwonder it is that you have not heard them, Boromir. From the ruin of the \\nGladden Fields, where Isildur perished, three men only came ever back over \\nthe mountains after long wandering. One of these was Ohtar, the esquire of \\nIsildur, who bore the shards of the sword of Elendil; and he brought them to \\nValandil, the heir of Isildur, who being but a child had remained here in \\nRivendell. But Narsil was broken and its light extinguished, and it has not \\nyet been forged again. \\n\\n\\'Fruitless did I call the victory of the Fast Alliance? Not wholly so, \\nyet it did not achieve its end. Sauron was diminished, but not destroyed. \\n\\nHis Ring was lost but not unmade. The Dark Tower was broken, but its \\nfoundations were not removed; for they were made with the power of the Ring, \\nand while it remains they will endure. Many Elves and many mighty Men, \\nand \\n\\nmany of their friends, had perished in the war. Anbrion was slain, and \\nIsildur was slain; and Gil-galad and Elendil were no more. Never again shall \\nthere be any such league of Elves and Men; for Men multiply and the \\nFirstborn decrease, and the two kindreds are estranged. And ever since that \\nday the race of N(r)menor has decayed, and the span of their years has \\nlessened. \\n\\n\\'In the North after the war and the slaughter of the Gladden Fields the \\nMen of Westernesse were diminished, and their city of Ann(r)minas beside \\nFake \\n\\nEvendim fell into ruin; and the heirs of Valandil removed and dwelt at \\nFornost on the high North Downs, and that now too is desolate. Men call it \\nDeadmen\\'s Dike, and they fear to tread there. For the folk of Arnor \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndwindled, and their foes devoured them, and their lordship passed, leaving \\nonly green mounds in the grassy hills. \\n\\n\\'In the South the realm of Gondor long endured; and for a while its \\nsplendour grew, recalling somewhat of the might of N(r)menor, ere it fell. \\nHigh towers that people built, and strong places, and havens of many ships; \\nand the winged crown of the Kings of Men was held in awe by folk of many \\ntongues. Their chief city was Osgiliath, Citadel of the Stars, through the \\nmidst of which the River flowed. And Minas Ithil they built, Tower of the \\nRising Moon, eastward upon a shoulder of the Mountains of Shadow; and \\nwestward at the feet of the White Mountains Minas Anor they made, Tower of \\nthe Setting Sun. There in the courts of the King grew a white tree, from the \\nseed of that tree which Isildur brought over the deep waters, and the seed \\nof that tree before came from Eressla, and before that out of the Uttermost \\nWest in the Day before days when the world was young. \\n\\n\\'But in the wearing of the swift years of Middle-earth the line of \\nMeneldil son of Anbrion failed, and the Tree withered, and the blood of the \\nN(r)menoreans became mingled with that of lesser men. Then the watch upon \\nthe \\n\\nwalls of Mordor slept, and dark things crept back to Gorgoroth. And on a \\ntime evil things came forth, and they took Minas Ithil and abode in it, and \\nthey made it into a place of dread; and it is called Minas Morgul, the Tower \\nof Sorcery. Then Minas Anor was named anew Minas Tirith, the Tower of \\nGuard; \\n\\nand these two cities were ever at war, but Osgiliath which lay between was \\ndeserted and in its ruins shadows walked. \\n\\n\\'So it has been for many lives of men. But the Lords of Minas Tirith \\nstill fight on, defying our enemies, keeping the passage of the River from \\nArgonath to the Sea. And now that part of the tale that I shall tell is \\ndrawn to its close. For in the days of Isildur the Ruling Ring passed out of \\nall knowledge, and the Three were released from its dominion. But now in \\nthis latter day they are in peril once more, for to our sorrow the One has \\nbeen found. Others shall speak of its finding, for in that I played small \\npart.\\' \\n\\nHe ceased, but at once Boromir stood up, tall and proud, before them. \\n\\nGive me leave, Master Elrond, said he, first to say more of Gondor; for \\nverily from the land of Gondor I am come. And it would be well for all to \\nknow what passes there. For few, I deem, know of our deeds, and therefore \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nguess little of their peril, if we should fail at last. \\n\\n\\'Believe not that in the land of Gondor the blood of N(r)menor is spent, \\nnor all its pride and dignity forgotten. By our valour the wild folk of the \\nEast are still restrained, and the terror of Morgul kept at bay; and thus \\nalone are peace and freedom maintained in the lands behind us, bulwark of \\nthe West. But if the passages of the River should be won, what then? \\n\\n\\'Yet that hour, maybe, is not now far away. The Nameless Enemy has \\narisen again. Smoke rises once more from Orodruin that we call Mount \\nDoom. \\n\\nThe power of the Black Land grows and we are hard beset. When the \\nEnemy \\n\\nreturned our folk were driven from Ithilien, our fair domain east of the \\nRiver, though we kept a foothold there and strength of arms. But this very \\nyear, in the days of June, sudden war came upon us out of Mordor, and we \\nwere swept away. We were outnumbered, for Mordor has allied itself with the \\nEasterlings and the cruel Elaradrim; but it was not by numbers that we were \\ndefeated. A power was there that we have not felt before. \\n\\n\\'Some said that it could be seen, like a great black horseman, a dark \\nshadow under the moon. Wherever he came a madness filled our foes, but fear \\nfell on our boldest, so that horse and man gave way and fled. Only a remnant \\nof our eastern force came back, destroying the last bridge that still stood \\namid the ruins of Osgiliath. \\n\\n\\'I was in the company that held the bridge, until it was cast down \\nbehind us. Four only were saved by swimming: my brother and myself and \\ntwo \\n\\nothers. But still we fight on, holding all the west shores of Anduin; and \\nthose who shelter behind us give us praise, if ever they hear our name: much \\npraise but little help. Only from Rohan now will any men ride to us when we \\ncall. \\n\\n\\'In this evil hour I have come on an errand over many dangerous leagues \\nto Elrond: a hundred and ten days I have journeyed all alone. But I do not \\nseek allies in war. The might of Elrond is in wisdom not in weapons, it is \\nsaid. I come to ask for counsel and the unravelling of hard words. For on \\nthe eve of the sudden assault a dream came to my brother in a troubled \\nsleep; and afterwards a like dream came oft to him again, and once to me. \\n\\n\\'In that dream I thought the eastern sky grew dark and there was a \\ngrowing thunder, but in the West a pale light lingered, and out of it I \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nheard a voice, remote but clear, crying: \\n\\nSeek for the Sword that was broken: \\n\\nIn Imladris it dwells; \\n\\nThere shall be counsels taken \\nStronger than Morgul-spells. \\n\\nThere shall be shown a token \\nThat Doom is near at hand, \\n\\nFor Isildur\\'s Bane shall waken, \\n\\nAnd the Halfling forth shall stand. \\n\\nOf these words we could understand little, and we spoke to our father, \\nDenethor, Lord of Minas Tirith, wise in the lore of Gondor. This only would \\nhe say, that Imladris was of old the name among the Elves of a far northern \\ndale, where Elrond the Halfelven dwelt, greatest of lore-masters. Therefore \\nmy brother, seeing how desperate was our need, was eager to heed the dream \\nand seek for Imladris; but since the way was full of doubt and danger, I \\ntook the journey upon myself. Loth was my father to give me leave, and long \\nhave I wandered by roads forgotten, seeking the house of Elrond, of which \\nmany had heard, but few knew where it lay.\\' \\n\\n\\'And here in the house of Elrond more shall be made clear to you\\' said \\nAragorn, standing up. He cast his sword upon the table that stood before \\nElrond, and the blade was in two pieces. \\'Here is the Sword that was \\nBroken!\\' he said. \\n\\n\\'And who are you, and what have you to do with Minas Tirith?\\' asked \\nBoromir, looking in wonder at the lean face of the Ranger and his \\nweather-stained cloak. \\n\\n\\'He is Aragorn son of Arathorn,\\' said Elrond; \\'and he is descended \\nthrough many fathers from Isildur Elendil\\'s son of Minas Ithil. He is the \\nChief of the D(r)nedain in the North, and few are now left of that folk.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then it belongs to you, and not to me at all!\\' cried Frodo in \\namazement, springing to his feet, as if he expected the Ring to be demanded \\nat once. \\n\\n\\'It does not belong to either of us,\\' said Aragorn; \\'but it has been \\nordained that you should hold it for a while.\\' \\n\\n\\'Bring out the Ring, Frodo!\\' said Gandalf solemnly. \\'The time has come. \\nHold it up, and then Boromir will understand the remainder of his riddle.\\' \\n\\nThere was a hush, and all turned their eyes on Frodo. He was shaken by \\na sudden shame and fear; and he felt a great reluctance to reveal the Ring, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand a loathing of its touch. He wished he was far away. The Ring gleamed and \\nflickered as he held it up before them in his trembling hand. \\n\\n\\'Behold Isildur\\'s Bane!\\' said Elrond. \\n\\nBoromir\\'s eyes glinted as he gazed at the golden thing. \\'The Halfling!\\' \\nhe muttered. \\'Is then the doom of Minas Tirith come at last? But why then \\nshould we seek a broken sword?\\' \\n\\n\\'The words were not the doom of Minas Tirith ,\\' said Aragorn. \\'But doom \\nand great deeds are indeed at hand. For the Sword that was Broken is the \\nSword of Elendil that broke beneath him when he fell. It has been treasured \\nby his heirs when all other heirlooms were lost; for it was spoken of old \\namong us that it should be made again when the Ring, Isildur\\'s Bane, was \\nfound. Now you have seen the sword that you have sought, what would you \\nask? \\n\\nDo you wish for the House of Elendil to return to the Land of Gondor?\\' \\n\\n\\'I was not sent to beg any boon, but to seek only the meaning of a \\nriddle,\\' answered Boromir proudly. \\'Yet we are hard pressed, and the Sword \\nof Elendil would be a help beyond our hope-if such a thing could indeed \\nreturn out of the shadows of the past.\\' He looked again at Aragorn, and \\ndoubt was in his eyes. \\n\\nFrodo felt Bilbo stir impatiently at his side. Evidently he was annoyed \\non his friend\\'s behalf. Standing suddenly up he burst out: \\n\\nAll that is gold does not glitter, \\n\\nNot all those who wander are lost; \\n\\nThe old that is strong does not wither, \\n\\nDeep roots are not reached by the frost. \\n\\nFrom the ashes a fire shall be woken, \\n\\nA light from the shadows shall spring; \\n\\nRenewed shall be blade that was broken: \\n\\nThe crownless again shall be king. \\n\\n\\'Not very good perhaps, but to the point -- if you need more beyond the \\nword of Elrond. If that was worth a journey of a hundred and ten days to \\nhear, you had best listen to it.\\' He sat down with a snort. \\n\\n\\'I made that up myself,\\' he whispered to Frodo, \\'for the D(r)nadan, a \\nlong time ago when he first told me about himself. I almost wish that my \\nadventures were not over, and that I could go with him when his day comes.\\' \\n\\nAragorn smiled at him; then he turned to Boromir again. \\'For my part I \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nforgive your doubt,\\' he said. \\'Little do I resemble the figures of Elendil \\nand Isildur as they stand carven in their majesty in the halls of Denethor. \\n\\nI am but the heir of Isildur, not Isildur himself. I have had a hard life \\nand a long; and the leagues that lie between here and Gondor are a small \\npart in the count of my journeys. I have crossed many mountains and many \\nrivers, and trodden many plains, even into the far countries of Rhyn and \\nHarad where the stars are strange. \\n\\n\\'But my home, such as I have, is in the North. For here the heirs of \\nValandil have ever dwelt in long line unbroken from father unto son for many \\ngenerations. Our days have darkened, and we have dwindled; but ever the \\nSword has passed to a new keeper. And this I will say to you, Boromir, ere I \\nend. Lonely men are we, Rangers of the wild, hunters-- but hunters ever of \\nthe servants of the Enemy; for they are found in many places, not in Mordor \\nonly. \\n\\n\\'If Gondor, Boromir, has been a stalwart tower, we have played another \\npart. Many evil things there are that your strong walls and bright swords do \\nnot stay. You know little of the lands beyond your bounds. Peace and \\nfreedom, do you say? The North would have known them little but for us. Fear \\nwould have destroyed them. But when dark things come from the houseless \\nhills, or creep from sunless woods, they fly from us. What roads would any \\ndare to tread, what safety would there be in quiet lands, or in the homes of \\nsimple men at night, if the D(r)nedain were asleep, or were all gone into the \\ngrave? \\n\\n\\'And yet less thanks have we than you. Travellers scowl at us, and \\ncountrymen give us scornful names. \"Strider\" I am to one fat man who lives \\nwithin a day\\'s march of foes that would freeze his heart or lay his little \\ntown in ruin, if he were not guarded ceaselessly. Yet we would not have it \\notherwise. If simple folk are free from care and fear, simple they will be, \\nand we must be secret to keep them so. That has been the task of my kindred, \\nwhile the years have lengthened and the grass has grown. \\n\\n\\'But now the world is changing once again. A new hour comes. Isildur\\'s \\nBane is found. Battle is at hand. The Sword shall be reforged. I will come \\nto Minas Tirith.\\' \\n\\n\\'Isildur\\'s Bane is found, you say,\\' said Boromir. \\'I have seen a bright \\nring in the Halfling\\'s hand; but Isildur perished ere this age of the world \\nbegan, they say. How do the Wise know that this ring is his? And how has it \\npassed down the years, until it is brought hither by so strange a \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmessenger?\\' \\n\\n\\'That shall be told,\\' said Elrond. \\n\\n\\'But not yet, I beg, Master!\\' said Bilbo. \\'Already the Sun is climbing \\nto noon, and I feel the need of something to strengthen me.\\' \\n\\n\\'I had not named you,\\' said Elrond smiling. \\'But I do so now. Come! \\n\\nTell us your tale. And if you have not yet cast your story into verse, you \\nmay tell it in plain words. The briefer, the sooner shall you be refreshed.\\' \\n\\n\\'Very well,\\' said Bilbo. \\'I will do as you bid. But I will now tell the \\ntrue story, and if some here have heard me tell it otherwise\\' -- he looked \\nsidelong at Gluin -- l ask them to forget it and forgive me. I only wished \\nto claim the treasure as my very own in those days, and to be rid of the \\nname of thief that was put on me. But perhaps I understand things a little \\nbetter now. Anyway, this is what happened.\\' \\n\\nTo some there Bilbo\\'s tale was wholly new, and they listened with \\namazement while the old hobbit, actually not at all displeased, recounted \\nhis adventure with Gollum, at full length. He did not omit a single riddle. \\n\\nHe would have given also an account of his party and disappearance from the \\nShire, if he had been allowed; but Elrond raised his hand. \\n\\n\\'Well told, my friend,\\' he said, \\'but that is enough at this time. For \\nthe moment it suffices to know that the Ring passed to Frodo, your heir. Let \\nhim now speak!\\' \\n\\nThen, less willingly than Bilbo, Frodo told of all his dealings with \\nthe Ring from the day that it passed into his keeping. Every step of his \\njourney from Hobbiton to the Ford of Bruinen was questioned and considered, \\nand everything that he could recall concerning the Black Riders was \\nexamined. At last he sat down again. \\n\\n\\'Not bad,\\' Bilbo said to him. \\'You would have made a good story of it, \\nif they hadn\\'t kept on interrupting. I tried to make a few notes, but we \\nshall have to go over it all again together some time, if I am to write it \\nup. There are whole chapters of stuff before you ever got here!\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, it made quite a long tale,\\' answered Frodo. \\'But the story still \\ndoes not seem complete to me. I still want to know a good deal, especially \\nabout Gandalf.\\' \\n\\nGaldor of the Havens, who sat near by, overheard him. \\'You speak for me \\nalso,\\' he cried, and turning to Elrond he said: \\'The Wise may have good \\nreason to believe that the halfling\\'s trove is indeed the Great Ring of long \\ndebate, unlikely though that may seem to those who know less. But may we not \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhear the proofs? And I would ask this also. What of Saruman? He is learned \\nin the lore of the Rings, yet he is not among us. What is his counsel-if he \\nknows the things that we have heard?\\' \\n\\n\\'The questions that you ask, Galdor, are bound together,\\' said Elrond. \\n\\nI had not overlooked them, and they shall be answered. But these things it \\nis the part of Gandalf to make clear; and I call upon him last, for it is \\nthe place of honour, and in all this matter he has been the chief.\\' \\n\\n\\'Some, Galdor,\\' said Gandalf, \\'would think the tidings of Gluin, and \\nthe pursuit of Frodo, proof enough that the halfling\\'s trove is a thing of \\ngreat worth to the Enemy. Yet it is a ring. What then? The Nine the Nazgyl \\nkeep. The Seven are taken or destroyed.\\' At this Gluin stirred, but did not \\nspeak. \\'The Three we know of. What then is this one that he desires so much? \\n\\n\\'There is indeed a wide waste of time between the River and the \\nMountain, between the loss and the finding. But the gap in the knowledge of \\nthe Wise has been filled at last. Yet too slowly. For the Enemy has been \\nclose behind, closer even than I feared. And well is it that not until this \\nyear, this very summer, as it seems, did he learn the full truth. \\n\\n\\'Some here will remember that many years ago I myself dared to pass the \\ndoors of the Necromancer in Dol Guldur, and secretly explored his ways, and \\nfound thus that our fears were true: he was none other than Sauron, our \\nEnemy of old, at length taking shape and power again. Some, too, will \\nremember also that Saruman dissuaded us from open deeds against him, and \\nfor \\n\\nlong we watched him only. Yet at last, as his shadow grew, Saruman yielded, \\nand the Council put forth its strength and drove the evil out of Mirkwood \\nand that was in the very year of the finding of this Ring: a strange chance, \\nif chance it was. \\n\\n\\'But we were too late, as Elrond foresaw. Sauron also had watched us, \\nand had long prepared against our stroke, governing Mordor from afar through \\nMinas Morgul, where his Nine servants dwelt, until all was ready. Then he \\ngave way before us, but only feigned to flee, and soon after came to the \\nDark Tower and openly declared himself. Then for the last time the Council \\nmet; for now we learned that he was seeking ever more eagerly for the One. \\nWe feared then that he had some news of it that we knew nothing of. But \\nSaruman said nay, and repeated what he had said to us before: that the One \\nwould never again be found in Middle-earth. \\n\\n\"At the worst,\" said he, \"our Enemy knows that we have it not and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthat it still is lost. But what was lost may yet be found, he thinks. Fear \\nnot! His hope will cheat him. Have I not earnestly studied this matter? Into \\nAnduin the Great it fell; and long ago, while Sauron slept, it was rolled \\ndown the River to the Sea. There let it lie until the End.\\'\" \\n\\nGandalf fell silent, gazing eastward from the porch to the far peaks of \\nthe Misty Mountains, at whose great roots the peril of the world had so long \\nlain hidden. He sighed. \\n\\n\\'There I was at fault,\\' he said. \\'I was lulled by the words of Saruman \\nthe Wise; but I should have sought for the truth sooner, and our peril would \\nnow be less.\\' \\n\\n\\'We were all at fault,\\' said Elrond, \\'and but for your vigilance the \\nDarkness, maybe, would already be upon us. But say on!\\' \\n\\n\\'From the first my heart misgave me, against all reason that I knew,\\' \\nsaid Gandalf, \\'and I desired to know how this thing came to Gollum, and how \\nlong he had possessed it. So I set a watch for him, guessing that he would \\nere long come forth from his darkness to seek for his treasure. He came, but \\nhe escaped and was not found. And then alas ! I let the matter rest, watching \\nand waiting only, as we have too often done. \\n\\n\\'Time passed with many cares, until my doubts were awakened again to \\nsudden fear. Whence came the hobbit\\'s ring? What, if my fear was true, \\nshould be done with it? Those things I must decide. But I spoke yet of my \\ndread to none, knowing the peril of an untimely whisper, if it went astray. \\n\\nIn all the long wars with the Dark Tower treason has ever been our greatest \\nfoe. \\n\\n\\'That was seventeen years ago. Soon I became aware that spies of many \\nsorts, even beasts and birds, were gathered round the Shire, and my fear \\ngrew. I called for the help of the D(r)nedain, and their watch was doubled; \\nand I opened my heart to Aragorn, the heir of Isildur.\\' \\n\\n\\'And I,\\' said Aragorn, \\'counselled that we should hunt for Gollum. too \\nlate though it may seem. And since it seemed fit that Isildur\\'s heir should \\nlabour to repair Isildur\\'s fault, I went with Gandalf on the long and \\nhopeless search.\\' \\n\\nThen Gandalf told how they had explored the whole length of Wilderland, \\ndown even to the Mountains of Shadow and the fences of Mordor. \\'There we \\nhad \\n\\nrumour of him, and we guess that he dwelt there long in the dark hills; but \\nwe never found him, and at last I despaired. And then in my despair I \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthought again of a test that might make the finding of Gollum unneeded. The \\nring itself might tell if it were the One. The memory of words at the \\nCouncil came back to me: words of Saruman, half-heeded at the time. I heard \\nthem now clearly in my heart. \\n\\n\\' \"The Nine, the Seven, and the Three,\" he said, \"had each their proper \\ngem. Not so the One. It was round and unadorned, as it were one of the \\nlesser rings; but its maker set marks upon it that the skilled, maybe, could \\nstill see and read.\" \\n\\n\\'What those marks were he had not said. Who now would know? The \\nmaker. \\n\\nAnd Saruman? But great though his lore may be, it must have a source. What \\nhand save Sauron\\'s ever held this thing, ere it was lost? The hand of \\nIsildur alone. \\n\\n\\'With that thought, I forsook the chase, and passed swiftly to Gondor. \\n\\nIn former days the members of my order had been well received there, but \\nSaruman most of all. Often he had been for long the guest of the Lords of \\nthe City. Less welcome did the Lord Denethor show me then than of old, and \\ngrudgingly he permitted me to search among his hoarded scrolls and books. \\n\\n\\' \"If indeed you look only, as you say, for records of ancient days, \\nand the beginnings of the City, read on! \" he said. \"For to me what was is \\nless dark than what is to come, and that is my care. But unless you have \\nmore skill even than Saruman, who has studied here long, you will find \\nnaught that is not well known to me, who am master of the lore of this \\nCity.\" \\n\\n\\'So said Denethor. And yet there lie in his hoards many records that \\nfew now can read, even of the lore-masters, for their scripts and tongues \\nhave become dark to later men. And Boromir, there lies in Minas Tirith \\nstill, unread, I guess, by any save Saruman and myself since the kings \\nfailed, a scroll that Isildur made himself. For Isildur did not march away \\nstraight from the war in Mordor, as some have told the tale.\\' \\n\\n\\'Some in the North, maybe,\\' Boromir broke in. \\'All know in Gondor that \\nhe went first to Minas Anor and dwelt a while with his nephew Meneldil, \\ninstructing him, before he committed to him the rule of the South Kingdom. \\nIn that time he planted there the last sapling of the White Tree in memory \\nof his brother.\\' \\n\\n\\'But in that time also he made this scroll,\\' said Gandalf; \\'and that is \\nnot remembered in Gondor, it would seem. For this scroll concerns the Ring, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand thus wrote Isildur therein: \\n\\nThe Great Ring shall go now to be an heirloom of the North Kingdom; but \\nrecords of it shall be left in Gondor, where also dwell the heirs of \\nElendil, lest a time come when the memory of these great matters shall grow \\ndim. \\n\\n\\'And after these words Isildur described the Ring, such as he found it. \\n\\nIt was hot when I first took it, hot as a glede, and my hand was \\nscorched, so that I doubt if ever again I shall be free of the pain of it. \\n\\nYet even as I write it is cooled, and it seemeth to shrink, though it loseth \\nneither its beauty nor its shape. Already the writing upon it, which at \\nfirst was as clear as red flame, fadeth and is now only barely to be read. \\n\\nIt is fashioned in an elven-script of Eregion, for they have no letters in \\nMordor for such subtle work; but the language is unknown to me. I deem it to \\nbe a tongue of the Black Land, since it is foul and uncouth. What evil it \\nsaith I do not know; but I trace here a copy of it, lest it fade beyond \\nrecall. The Ring misseth, maybe, the heat of Sauron\\'s hand, which was black \\nand yet burned like fire, and so Gil-galad was destroyed; and maybe were the \\ngold made hot again, the writing would be refreshed, gut for my part I will \\nrisk no hurt to this thing: of all the works of Sauron the only fair. It is \\nprecious to me, though I buy it with great pain. \\n\\n\\'When I read these words, my quest was ended. For the traced writing \\nwas indeed as Isildur guessed, in the tongue of Mordor and the servants of \\nthe Tower. And what was said therein was already known. For in the day that \\nSauron first put on the One, Celebrimbor, maker of the Three, was aware of \\nhim, and from afar he heard him speak these words, and so his evil purposes \\nwere revealed. \\n\\n\\'At once I took my leave of Denethor, but even as I went northwards, \\nmessages came to me out of Lurien that Aragorn had passed that way, and that \\nhe had found the creature called Gollum. Therefore I went first to meet him \\nand hear his tale. Into what deadly perils he had gone alone I dared not \\nguess.\\' \\n\\n\\'There is little need to tell of them,\\' said Aragorn. \\'If a man must \\nneeds walk in sight of the Black Gate, or tread the deadly flowers of Morgul \\nVale, then perils he will have. I, too, despaired at last, and I began my \\nhomeward journey. And then, by fortune, I came suddenly on what I sought: \\nthe marks of soft feet beside a muddy pool. But now the trail was fresh and \\nswift, and it led not to Mordor but away. Along the skirts of the Dead \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMarshes I followed it, and then I had him. Lurking by a stagnant mere, \\npeering in the water as the dark eve fell, I caught him, Gollum. He was \\ncovered with green slime. He will never love me, I fear; for he bit me, and \\nI was not gentle. Nothing more did I ever get from his mouth than the marks \\nof his teeth. I deemed it the worst part of all my journey, the road back, \\nwatching him day and night, making him walk before me with a halter on his \\nneck, gagged, until he was tamed by lack of drink and food, driving him ever \\ntowards Mirkwood. I brought him there at last and gave him to the Elves, for \\nwe had agreed that this should be done; and I was glad to be rid of his \\ncompany, for he stank. For my part I hope never to look upon him again; but \\nGandalf came and endured long speech with him.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, long and weary,\\' said Gandalf, \\'but not without profit. For one \\nthing, the tale he told of his loss agreed with that which Bilbo has now \\ntold openly for the first time; but that mattered little, since I had \\nalready guessed it. But I learned then first that Gollum\\'s ring came out of \\nthe Great River nigh to the Gladden Fields. And I learned also that he had \\npossessed it long. Many lives of his small kind. The power of the ring had \\nlengthened his years far beyond their span; but that power only the Great \\nRings wield. \\n\\n\\'And if that is not proof enough, Galdor, there is the other test that \\nI spoke of. Upon this very ring which you have here seen held aloft, round \\nand unadorned, the letters that Isildur reported may still be read, if one \\nhas the strength of will to set the golden thing in the fire a while. That I \\nhave done, and this I have read: \\n\\nAsh nazg durbatulyk, ush nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulyk agh \\nburzum-ishi krimpatul. \\' \\n\\nThe change in the wizard\\'s voice was astounding. Suddenly it became \\nmenacing, powerful, harsh as stone. A shadow seemed to pass over the high \\nsun, and the porch for a moment grew dark. All trembled, and the Elves \\nstopped their ears. \\n\\n\\'Never before has any voice dared to utter the words of that tongue in \\nImladris, Gandalf the Grey,\\' said Elrond, as the shadow passed and the \\ncompany breathed once more. \\n\\n\\'And let us hope that none will ever speak it here again,\\' answered \\nGandalf. \\'Nonetheless I do not ask your pardon, Master Elrond. For if that \\ntongue is not soon to be heard in every corner of the West, then let all put \\ndoubt aside that this thing is indeed what the Wise have declared: the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntreasure of the Enemy, fraught with all his malice; and in it lies a great \\npart of his strength of old. Out of the Black Years come the words that the \\nSmiths of Eregion heard, and knew that they had been betrayed: \\n\\nOne Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring \\nthem all and in the Darkness bind them. \\n\\n\\'Know also, my friends, that I learned more yet from Gollum. He was \\nloth to speak and his tale was unclear, but it is beyond all doubt that he \\nwent to Mordor, and there all that he knew was forced from him. Thus the \\nEnemy knows now that the One is found, that it was long in the Shire; and \\nsince his servants have pursued it almost to our door, he soon will know, \\nalready he may know, even as I speak, that we have it here.\\' \\n\\nAll sat silent for a while, until at length Boromir spoke. \\'He is a \\nsmall thing, you say, this Gollum? Small, but great in mischief. What became \\nof him? To what doom did you put him?\\' \\n\\n\\'He is in prison, but no worse,\\' said Aragorn. \\'He had suffered much. \\n\\nThere is no doubt that he was tormented, and the fear of Sauron lies black \\non his heart. Still I for one am glad that he is safely kept by the watchful \\nElves of Mirkwood. His malice is great and gives him a strength hardly to be \\nbelieved in one so lean and withered. He could work much mischief still, if \\nhe were free. And I do not doubt that he was allowed to leave Mordor on some \\nevil errand.\\' \\n\\n\\'Alas! alas!\\' cried Legolas, and in his fair elvish face there was \\ngreat distress. \\'The tidings that I was sent to bring must now be told. They \\nare not good, but only here have I learned how evil they may seem to this \\ncompany. Smjagol, who is now called Gollum, has escaped.\\' \\n\\n\\'Escaped?\\' cried Aragorn. \\'That is ill news indeed. We shall all rue it \\nbitterly, I fear. How came the folk of Thranduil to fail in their trust?\\' \\n\\n\\'Not through lack of watchfulness,\\' said Legolas; \\'but perhaps through \\nover -kindliness. And we fear that the prisoner had aid from others, and that \\nmore is known of our doings than we could wish. We guarded this creature day \\nand night, at Gandalf s bidding, much though we wearied of the task. But \\nGandalf bade us hope still for his cure, and we had not the heart to keep \\nhim ever in dungeons under the earth, where he would fall back into his old \\nblack thoughts.\\' \\n\\n\\'You were less tender to me,\\' said Gluin with a flash of his eyes as \\nold memories were stirred of his imprisonment in the deep places of the \\nElven-king\\'s halls. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Now come!\\' said Gandalf. \\'Pray do not interrupt, my good Gluin. That \\nwas a regrettable misunderstanding, long set right. If all the grievances \\nthat stand between Elves and Dwarves are to be brought up here, we may as \\nwell abandon this Council.\\' \\n\\nGluin rose and bowed, and Legolas continued. \\'In the days of fair \\nweather we led Gollum through the woods; and there was a high tree standing \\nalone far from the others which he liked to climb. Often we let him mount up \\nto the highest branches, until he felt the free wind; but we set a guard at \\nthe tree\\'s foot. One day he refused to come down, and the guards had no mind \\nto climb after him: he had learned the trick of clinging to boughs with his \\nfeet as well as with his hands; so they sat by the tree far into the night. \\n\\n\\'It was that very night of summer, yet moonless and starless, that Ores \\ncame on us at unawares. We drove them off after some time; they were many \\nand fierce, but they came from over the mountains, and were unused to the \\nwoods. When the battle was over, we found that Gollum was gone, and his \\nguards were slain or taken. It then seemed plain to us that the attack had \\nbeen made for his rescue, and that he knew of it beforehand. How that was \\ncontrived we cannot guess; but Gollum is cunning, and the spies of the Enemy \\nare many. The dark things that were driven out in the year of the Dragon\\'s \\nfall have returned in greater numbers, and Mirkwood is again an evil place, \\nsave where our realm is maintained. \\n\\n\\'We have failed to recapture Gollum. We came on his trail among those \\nof many Ores, and it plunged deep into the Forest, going south. But ere long \\nit escaped our skill, and we dared not continue the hunt; for we were \\ndrawing nigh to Dol Guldur, and that is still a very evil place; we do not \\ngo that way.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, well, he is gone,\\' said Gandalf. \\'We have no time to seek for \\nhim again. He must do what he will. But he may play a part yet that neither \\nhe nor Sauron have foreseen. \\n\\n\\'And now I will answer Galdor\\'s other questions. What of Saruman? What \\nare his counsels to us in this need? This tale I must tell in full, for only \\nElrond has heard it yet, and that in brief, but it will bear on all that we \\nmust resolve. It is the last chapter in the Tale of the Ring, so far as it \\nhas yet gone. \\n\\n\\'At the end of June I was in the Shire, but a cloud of anxiety was on \\nmy mind, and I rode to the southern borders of the little land; for I had a \\nforeboding of some danger, still hidden from me but drawing near. There \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmessages reached me telling me of war and defeat in Gondor, and when I heard \\nof the Black Shadow a chill smote my heart. But I found nothing save a few \\nfugitives from the South; yet it seemed to me that on them sat a fear of \\nwhich they would not speak. I turned then east and north and journeyed along \\nthe Greenway; and not far from Bree I came upon a traveller sitting on a \\nbank beside the road with his grazing horse beside him. It was Radagast the \\nBrown, who at one time dwelt at Rhosgobel, near the borders of Mirkwood. \\n\\nHe \\n\\nis one of my order, but I had not seen him for many a year. \\n\\n\\' \"Gandalf ! \" he cried. \"I was seeking you. But I am a stranger in \\nthese parts. All I knew was that you might be found in a wild region with \\nthe uncouth name of Shire.\" \\n\\n\\' \"Your information was correct,\" I said. \"But do not put it that way, \\nif you meet any of the inhabitants. You are near the borders of the Shire \\nnow. And what do you want with me? It must be pressing. You were never a \\ntraveller, unless driven by great need.\" \\n\\n\\' \"I have an urgent errand,\" he said. \"My news is evil.\" Then he looked \\nabout him, as if the hedges might have ears. \"Nazgyl,\" he whispered. \"The \\nNine are abroad again. They have crossed the River secretly and are moving \\nwestward. They have taken the guise of riders in black.\" \\n\\n\\'I knew then what I had dreaded without knowing it. \\n\\n\" \"The enemy must have some great need or purpose,\" said Radagast; \"but \\nwhat it is that makes him look to these distant and desolate parts, I cannot \\nguess.\" \\n\\nv \"What do you mean? \" said I. \\n\\nv \"I have been told that wherever they go the Riders ask for news of a \\nland called Shire.\" \\n\\n\\' \"The Shire,\" I said; but my heart sank. For even the Wise might fear \\nto withstand the Nine, when they are gathered together under their fell \\nchieftain. A great king and sorcerer he was of old, and now he wields a \\ndeadly fear. \"Who told you, and who sent you? \" I asked. \\n\\n\\' \"Saruman the White,\" answered Radagast. \"And he told me to say that \\nif you feel the need, he will help; but you must seek his aid at once, or it \\nwill be too late.\" \\n\\n\\'And that message brought me hope. For Saruman the White is the \\ngreatest of my order. Radagast is, of course, a worthy Wizard, a master of \\nshapes and changes of hue; and he has much lore of herbs and beasts, and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbirds are especially his friends. But Saruman has long studied the arts of \\nthe Enemy himself, and thus we have often been able to forestall him. It was \\nby the devices of Saruman that we drove him from Dol Guldur. It might be \\nthat he had found some weapons that would drive back the Nine. \\n\\n\\' \"I will go to Saruman,\" I said. \\n\\n\\' \"Then you must go now,\" said Radagast; \"for I have wasted time in \\nlooking for you, and the days are running short. I was told to find you \\nbefore Midsummer, and that is now here. Even if you set out from this spot, \\nyou will hardly reach him before the Nine discover the land that they seek. \\n\\nI myself shall turn back at once.\" And with that he mounted and would have \\nridden straight off. \\n\\n\\' \"Stay a moment! \" I said. \"We shall need your help, and the help of \\nall things that will give it. Send out messages to all the beasts and birds \\nthat are your friends. Tell them to bring news of anything that bears on \\nthis matter to Saruman and Gandalf. Let messages be sent to Orthanc.\" \\n\\n\"I will do that,\" he said, and rode off as if the Nine were after \\n\\nhim. \\n\\n\\'I could not follow him then and there. I had ridden very far already \\nthat day, and I was as weary as my horse; and I needed to consider matters. \\n\\nI stayed the night in Bree, and decided that I had no time to return to the \\nShire. Never did I make a greater mistake! \\n\\n\\'However, I wrote a message to Frodo, and trusted to my friend the \\ninnkeeper to send it to him. I rode away at dawn; and I came at long last to \\nthe dwelling of Saruman. That is far south in Isengard, in the end of the \\nMisty Mountains, not far from the Gap of Rohan. And Boromir will tell you \\nthat that is a great open vale that lies between the Misty Mountains and the \\nnorthmost foothills of Ered Nimrais, the White Mountains of his home. But \\nIsengard is a circle of sheer rocks that enclose a valley as with a wall, \\nand in the midst of that valley is a tower of stone called Orthanc. It was \\nnot made by Saruman, but by the Men of N(r)menor long ago; and it is very tall \\nand has many secrets; yet it looks not to be a work of craft. It cannot be \\nreached save by passing the circle of Isengard; and in that circle there is \\nonly one gate. \\n\\n\\'Late one evening I came to the gate, like a great arch in the wall of \\nrock; and it was strongly guarded. But the keepers of the gate were on the \\nwatch for me and told me that Saruman awaited me. I rode under the arch, and \\nthe gate closed silently behind me, and suddenly I was afraid, though I knew \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nno reason for it. \\n\\n\\'But I rode to the foot of Orthanc, and came to the stair of Saruman \\nand there he met me and led me up to his high chamber. He wore a ring on his \\nfinger. \\n\\n\"So you have come, Gandalf,\" he said to me gravely; but in his eyes \\nthere seemed to be a white light, as if a cold laughter was in his heart. \\n\\nv \"Yes, I have come,\" I said. \"I have come for your aid, Saruman the \\nWhite.\" And that title seemed to anger him. \\n\\n\\' \"Have you indeed, Gandalf the Grey l \" he scoffed. \"For aid? It has \\nseldom been heard of that Gandalf the Grey sought for aid, one so cunning \\nand so wise, wandering about the lands, and concerning himself in every \\nbusiness, whether it belongs to him or not.\" \\n\\n\\'I looked at him and wondered. \"But if I am not deceived,\" said I, \\n\\n\"things are now moving which will require the union of all our strength.\" \\n\\n\\' \"That may be so,\" he said, \"but the thought is late in coming to you. \\n\\nHow long. I wonder, have you concealed from me, the head of the Council, a \\nmatter of greatest import? What brings you now from your lurking-place in \\nthe Shire? \" \\n\\n\\' \"The Nine have come forth again,\" I answered. \"They have crossed the \\nRiver. So Radagast said to me.\" \\n\\nv \"Radagast the Brown! \" laughed Saruman, and he no longer concealed \\nhis scorn. \"Radagast the Bird-tamer! Radagast the Simple! Radagast the Fool! \\nYet he had just the wit to play the part that I set him. For you have come, \\nand that was all the purpose of my message. And here you will stay, Gandalf \\nthe Grey, and rest from journeys. For I am Saruman the Wise, Saruman \\nRing-maker, Saruman of Many Colours! \" \\n\\n\\'I looked then and saw that his robes, which had seemed white, were not \\nso, but were woven of all colours, and if he moved they shimmered and \\nchanged hue so that the eye was bewildered. \\n\\n\\' \"I liked white better,\" I said. \\n\\n\\' \"White! \" he sneered. \"It serves as a beginning. White cloth may be \\ndyed. The white page can be overwritten; and the white light can be broken.\" \\n\\n\\' \"In which case it is no longer white,\" said I. \"And he that breaks a \\nthing to find out what it is has left the path of wisdom.\" \\n\\n\\' \"You need not speak to me as to one of the fools that you take for \\nfriends,\" said he. \"I have not brought you hither to be instructed by you, \\nbut to give you a choice.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'He drew himself up then and began to declaim, as if he were making a \\nspeech long rehearsed. \"The Elder Days are gone. The Middle Days are \\npassing. The Younger Days are beginning. The time of the Elves is over, but \\nour time is at hand: the world of Men, which we must rule. But we must have \\npower, power to order all things as we will, for that good which only the \\nWise can see. \\n\\n\\' \"And listen, Gandalf, my old friend and helper! \" he said, coming \\nnear and speaking now in a softer voice. \"I said we, for we it may be, if \\nyou will join with me. A new Power is rising. Against it the old allies and \\npolicies will not avail us at all. There is no hope left in Elves or dying \\nN(r)menor. This then is one choice before you. before us. We may join with \\nthat Power. It would be wise, Gandalf. There is hope that way. Its victory \\nis at hand; and there will be rich reward for those that aided it. As the \\nPower grows, its proved friends will also grow; and the Wise, such as you \\nand I, may with patience come at last to direct its courses, to control it. \\n\\nWe can bide our time, we can keep our thoughts in our hearts, deploring \\nmaybe evils done by the way, but approving the high and ultimate purpose: \\nKnowledge, Rule, Order; all the things that we have so far striven in vain \\nto accomplish, hindered rather than helped by our weak or idle friends. \\nThere need not be, there would not be, any real change in our designs, only \\nin our means.\" \\n\\n\\' \"Saruman,\" I said, \"I have heard speeches of this kind before, but \\nonly in the mouths of emissaries sent from Mordor to deceive the ignorant. I \\ncannot think that you brought me so far only to weary my ears.\" \\n\\n\\'He looked at me sidelong, and paused a while considering. \"Well, I see \\nthat this wise course does not commend itself to you,\" he said. \"Not yet? \\n\\nNot if some better way can be contrived? \" \\n\\n\\'He came and laid his long hand on my arm. \"And why not, Gandalf? \" he \\nwhispered. \"Why not? The Ruling Ring? If we could command that, then the \\nPower would pass to us. That is in truth why I brought you here. For I have \\nmany eyes in my service, and I believe that you know where this precious \\nthing now lies. Is it not so? Or why do the Nine ask for the Shire, and what \\nis your business there? \" As he said this a lust which he could not conceal \\nshone suddenly in his eyes. \\n\\n\\' \"Saruman,\" I said, standing away from him, \"only one hand at a time \\ncan wield the One, and you know that well, so do not trouble to say we! But \\nI would not give it, nay, I would not give even news of it to you, now that \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI learn your mind. You were head of the Council, but you have unmasked \\nyourself at last. Well, the choices are, it seems, to submit to Sauron, or \\nto yourself. I will take neither. Have you others to offer? \" \\n\\n\\'He was cold now and perilous. \"Yes,\" he said. \"I did not expect you to \\nshow wisdom, even in your own behalf; but I gave you the chance of aiding me \\nwillingly, and so saving yourself much trouble and pain. The third choice is \\nto stay here, until the end.\" \\n\\n\\' \"Until what end? \" \\n\\n\\' \"Until you reveal to me where the One may be found. I may find means \\nto persuade you. Or until it is found in your despite, and the Ruler has \\ntime to turn to lighter matters: to devise, say, a fitting reward for the \\nhindrance and insolence of Gandalf the Grey.\" \\n\\n\\' \"That may not prove to be one of the lighter matters,\" said I. He \\nlaughed at me, for my words were empty, and he knew it. \\n\\n\\'They took me and they set me alone on the pinnacle of Orthanc, in the \\nplace where Saruman was accustomed to watch the stars. There is no descent \\nsave by a narrow stair of many thousand steps, and the valley below seems \\nfar away. I looked on it and saw that, whereas it had once been green and \\nfair, it was now filled with pits and forges. Wolves and ores were housed in \\nIsengard, for Saruman was mustering a great force on his own account, in \\nrivalry of Sauron and not in his service yet. Over all his works a dark \\nsmoke hung and wrapped itself about the sides of Orthanc. I stood alone on \\nan island in the clouds; and I had no chance of escape, and my days were \\nbitter. I was pierced with cold, and I had but little room in which to pace \\nto and fro, brooding on the coming of the Riders to the North. \\n\\n\\'That the Nine had indeed arisen I felt assured, apart from the words \\nof Saruman which might be lies. Long ere I came to Isengard I had heard \\ntidings by the way that could not be mistaken. Fear was ever in my heart for \\nmy friends in the Shire; but still I had some hope. I hoped that Frodo had \\nset forth at once, as my letter had urged, and that he had reached Rivendell \\nbefore the deadly pursuit began. And both my fear and my hope proved \\nill-founded. For my hope was founded on a fat man in Bree; and my fear was \\nfounded on the cunning of Sauron. But fat men who sell ale have many calls \\nto answer; and the power of Sauron is still less than fear makes it. But in \\nthe circle of Isengard, trapped and alone, it was not easy to think that the \\nhunters before whom all have fled or fallen would falter in the Shire far \\naway.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'I saw you!\\' cried Frodo. \\'You were walking backwards and forwards. The \\nmoon shone in your hair.\\' \\n\\nGandalf paused astonished and looked at him. \\'It was only a dream\\' said \\nFrodo, \\'but it suddenly came back to me. I had quite forgotten it. It came \\nsome time ago; after I left the Shire, I think.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then it was late in coming,\\' said Gandalf, \\'as you will see. I was in \\nan evil plight. And those who know me will agree that I have seldom been in \\nsuch need, and do not bear such misfortune well. Gandalf the Grey caught \\nlike a fly in a spider\\'s treacherous web! Yet even the most subtle spiders \\nmay leave a weak thread. \\n\\n\\'At first I feared, as Saruman no doubt intended, that Radagast had \\nalso fallen. Yet I had caught no hint of anything wrong in his voice or in \\nhis eye at our meeting. If I had, I should never have gone to Isengard, or I \\nshould have gone more warily. So Saruman guessed, and he had concealed his \\nmind and deceived his messenger. It would have been useless in any case to \\ntry and win over the honest Radagast to treachery. He sought me in good \\nfaith, and so persuaded me. \\n\\n\\'That was the undoing of Saruman\\'s plot. For Radagast knew no reason \\nwhy he should not do as I asked; and he rode away towards Mirkwood where \\nhe \\n\\nhad many friends of old. And the Eagles of the Mountains went far and wide, \\nand they saw many things: the gathering of wolves and the mustering of Ores; \\nand the Nine Riders going hither and thither in the lands; and they heard \\nnews of the escape of Gollum. And they sent a messenger to bring these \\ntidings to me. \\n\\n\\'So it was that when summer waned, there came a night of moon, and \\nGwaihir the Windlord, swiftest of the Great Eagles, came unlooked-for to \\nOrthanc; and he found me standing on the pinnacle. Then I spoke to him and \\nhe bore me away, before Saruman was aware. I was far from Isengard, ere the \\nwolves and ores issued from the gate to pursue me. \\n\\n\\' \"How far can you bear me? \" I said to Gwaihir. \\n\\n\\' \"Many leagues,\" said he, \"but not to the ends of the earth. I was \\nsent to bear tidings not burdens.\" \\n\\n\\' \"Then I must have a steed on land,\" I said, \"and a steed surpassingly \\nswift, for I have never had such need of haste before.\" \\n\\n\\' \"Then I will bear you to Edoras, where the Lord of Rohan sits in his \\nhalls,\" he said; \"for that is not very far off.\" And I was glad, for in the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRiddermark of Rohan the Rohirrim, the Horse-lords, dwell, and there are no \\nhorses like those that are bred in that great vale between the Misty \\nMountains and the White. \\n\\n\\' \"Are the Men of Rohan still to be trusted, do you think? \" I said to \\nGwaihir, for the treason of Saruman had shaken my faith. \\n\\n\\' \"They pay a tribute of horses,\" he answered, \"and send many yearly to \\nMordor, or so it is said; but they are not yet under the yoke. But if \\nSaruman has become evil, as you say, then their doom cannot be long \\ndelayed.\" \\n\\n\\'He set me down in the land of Rohan ere dawn; and now I have \\nlengthened my tale over long. The rest must be more brief. In Rohan I found \\nevil already at work: the lies of Saruman; and the king of the land would \\nnot listen to my warnings. He bade me take a horse and be gone; and I chose \\none much to my liking, but little to his. I took the best horse in his land, \\nand I have never seen the like of him.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then he must be a noble beast indeed,\\' said Aragorn; \\'and it grieves \\nme more than many tidings that might seem worse to learn that Sauron levies \\nsuch tribute. It was not so when last I was in that land.\\' \\n\\n\\'Nor is it now, I will swear,\\' said Boromir. \\'It is a lie that comes \\nfrom the Enemy. I know the Men of Rohan; true and valiant, our allies, \\ndwelling still in the lands that we gave them long ago.\\' \\n\\n\\'The shadow of Mordor lies on distant lands,\\' answered Aragorn. \\n\\'Saruman has fallen under it. Rohan is beset. Who knows what you will find \\nthere, if ever you return?\\' \\n\\n\\'Not this at least.\\' said Boromir, \\'that they will buy their lives with \\nhorses. They love their horses next to their kin. And not without reason, \\nfor the horses of the Riddermark come from the fields of the North, far from \\nthe Shadow, and their race, as that of their masters, is descended from the \\nfree days of old.\\' \\n\\n\\'True indeed!\\' said Gandalf. \\'And there is one among them that might \\nhave been foaled in the morning of the world. The horses of the Nine cannot \\nvie with him; tireless, swift as the flowing wind. Shadowfax they called \\nhim. By day his coat glistens like silver; and by night it is like a shade, \\nand he passes unseen. Light is his footfall! Never before had any man \\nmounted him, but I took him and I tamed him, and so speedily he bore me that \\nI reached the Shire when Frodo was on the Barrow-downs, though I set out \\nfrom Rohan only when he set out from Hobbiton. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'But fear grew in me as I rode. Ever as I came north I heard tidings of \\nthe Riders, and though I gained on them day by day, they were ever before \\nme. They had divided their forces, I learned: some remained on the eastern \\nborders, not far from the Greenway. and some invaded the Shire from the \\nsouth. I came to Hobbiton and Frodo had gone; but I had words with old \\nGamgee. Many words and few to the point. He had much to say about the \\nshortcomings of the new owners of Bag End. \\n\\n\\' \"I can\\'t abide changes,\" said he, \"not at my time of life, and least \\nof all changes for the worst.\" \"Changes for the worst,\" he repeated many \\ntimes. \\n\\n\\' \"Worst is a bad word,\" I said to him, \"and I hope you do not live to \\nsee it.\" But amidst his talk I gathered at last that Frodo had left Hobbiton \\nless than a week before, and that a black horseman had come to the Hill the \\nsame evening. Then I rode on in fear. I came to Buckland and found it in \\nuproar, as busy as a hive of ants that has been stirred with a stick. I came \\nto the house at Crickhollow, and it was broken open and empty; but on the \\nthreshold there lay a cloak that had been Frodo\\'s. Then for a while hope \\nleft me, and I did not wait to gather news, or I might have been comforted; \\nbut I rode on the trail of the Riders. It was hard to follow, for it went \\nmany ways, and I was at a loss. But it seemed to me that one or two had \\nridden towards Bree; and that way I went, for I thought of words that might \\nbe said to the innkeeper. \\n\\n\\' \"Butterbur they call him,\" thought I. \"If this delay was his fault, I \\nwill melt all the butter in him. I will roast the old fool over a slow \\nfire.\" He expected no less, and when he saw my face he fell down flat and \\nbegan to melt on the spot.\\' \\n\\n\\'What did you do to him?\\' cried Frodo in alarm. \\'He was really very \\nkind to us and did all that he could.\\' \\n\\nGandalf laughed. \\'Don\\'t be afraid!\\' he said. \\'I did not bite, and I \\nbarked very little. So overjoyed was I by the news that I got out of him, \\nwhen he stopped quaking, that I embraced the old fellow. How it happened I \\ncould not then guess, but I learned that you had been in Bree the night \\nbefore, and had gone off that morning with Strider. \\n\\n\\' \"Strider! \" I cried, shouting for joy. \\n\\n\"Yes, sir, I am afraid so, sir,\" said Butterbur, mistaking me. \"He \\ngot at them, in spite of all that I could do, and they took up with him. \\n\\nThey behaved very queer all the time they were here: wilful, you might say.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ass! Fool! Thrice worthy and beloved Barliman! \" said I. \"It\\'s the \\nbest news I have had since midsummer: it\\'s worth a gold piece at the least. \\nMay your beer be laid under an enchantment of surpassing excellence for \\nseven years! \" said I. \"Now I can take a night\\'s rest, the first since I \\nhave forgotten when.\" \\n\\n\\'Sol stayed there that night, wondering much what had become of the \\nRiders; for only of two had there yet been any news in Bree, it seemed. But \\nin the night we heard more. Five at least came from the west, and they threw \\ndown the gates and passed through Bree like a howling wind; and the \\nBree-folk are still shivering and expecting the end of the world. I got up \\nbefore dawn and went after them. \\n\\n\\'I do not know, but it seems clear to me that this is what happened. \\n\\nTheir Captain remained in secret away south of Bree, while two rode ahead \\nthrough the village, and four more invaded the Shire. But when these were \\nfoiled in Bree and at Crickhollow, they returned to their Captain with \\ntidings, and so left the Road unguarded for a while, except by their spies. \\n\\nThe Captain then sent some eastward straight across country, and he himself \\nwith the rest rode along the Road in great wrath. \\n\\n\\'I galloped to Weathertop like a gale, and I reached it before sundown \\non my second day from Bree-and they were there before me. They drew \\naway \\n\\nfrom me, for they felt the coming of my anger and they dared not face it \\nwhile the Sun was in the sky. But they closed round at night, and I was \\nbesieged on the hill -top, in the old ring of Amon Syl. I was hard put to it \\nindeed: such light and flame cannot have been seen on Weathertop since the \\nwar-beacons of old. \\n\\n\\'At sunrise I escaped and fled towards the north. I could not hope to \\ndo more. It was impossible to find you, Frodo, in the wilderness, and it \\nwould have been folly to try with all the Nine at my heels. Sol had to \\ntrust to Aragorn. But I hoped to draw some of them off, and yet reach \\nRivendell ahead of you and send out help. Four Riders did indeed follow me, \\nbut they turned back after a while and made for the Ford, it seems. That \\nhelped a little, for there were only five, not nine, when your camp was \\nattacked. \\n\\n\\'I reached here at last by a long hard road, up the Floarwell and \\nthrough the Ettenmoors, and down from the north. It took me nearly fourteen \\ndays from Weathertop, for I could not ride among the rocks of the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntroll-fells, and Shadowfax departed. I sent him back to his master; but a \\ngreat friendship has grown between us, and if I have need he will come at my \\ncall. But so it was that I came to Rivendell only three days before the \\nRing, and news of its peril had already been brought here-which proved well \\nindeed. \\n\\n\\'And that, Frodo, is the end of my account. May Elrond and the others \\nforgive the length of it. But such a thing has not happened before, that \\nGandalf broke tryst and did not come when he promised. An account to the \\nRing-bearer of so strange an event was required, I think. \\n\\n\\'Well, the Tale is now told, from first to last. Here we all are, and \\nhere is the Ring. But we have not yet come any nearer to our purpose. What \\nshall we do with it?\\' \\n\\nThere was silence. At last Elrond spoke again. \\n\\n\\'This is grievous news concerning Saruman,\\' he said; \\'for we trusted \\nhim and he is deep in all our counsels. It is perilous to study too deeply \\nthe arts of the Enemy, for good or for ill. But such falls and betrayals, \\nalas, have happened before. Of the tales that we have heard this day the \\ntale of Frodo was most strange to me. I have known few hobbits, save Bilbo \\nhere; and it seems to me that he is perhaps not so alone and singular as I \\nhad thought him. The world has changed much since I last was on the \\nwestward \\nroads. \\n\\n\\'The Barrow- wights we know by many names; and of the Old Forest \\nmany \\n\\ntales have been told: all that now remains is but an outlier of its northern \\nmarch. Time was when a squirrel could go from tree to tree from what is now \\nthe Shire to Dunland west of Isengard. In those lands I journeyed once, and \\nmany things wild and strange I knew. But I had forgotten Bombadil, if indeed \\nthis is still the same that walked the woods and hills long ago, and even \\nthen was older than the old. That was not then his name. Iarwain Ben-adar we \\ncalled him, oldest and fatherless. But many another name he has since been \\ngiven by other folk: Forn by the Dwarves, Orald by Northern Men, and other \\nnames beside. He is a strange creature, but maybe I should have summoned \\nhim \\n\\nto our Council.\\' \\n\\n\\'He would not have come,\\' said Gandalf. \\n\\n\\'Could we not still send messages to him and obtain his help?\\' asked \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nErestor. \\'It seems that he has a power even over the Ring.\\' \\n\\n\\'No, I should not put it so,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Say rather that the Ring \\nhas no power over him. He is his own master. But he cannot alter the Ring \\nitself, nor break its power over others. And now he is withdrawn into a \\nlittle land, within bounds that he has set, though none can see them, \\nwaiting perhaps for a change of days, and he will not step beyond them.\\' \\n\\n\\'But within those bounds nothing seems to dismay him,\\' said Erestor. \\n\\'Would he not take the Ring and keep it there, for ever harmless?\\' \\n\\n\\'No,\\' said Gandalf, \\'not willingly. He might do so, if all the free \\nfolk of the world begged him, but he would not understand the need. And if \\nhe were given the Ring, he would soon forget it, or most likely throw it \\naway. Such things have no hold on his mind. He would be a most unsafe \\nguardian; and that alone is answer enough.\\' \\n\\n\\'But in any case,\\' said Glorfindel, \\'to send the Ring to him would only \\npostpone the day of evil. He is far away. We could not now take it back to \\nhim, unguessed, unmarked by any spy. And even if we could, soon or late the \\nLord of the Rings would learn of its hiding place and would bend all his \\npower towards it. Could that power be defied by Bombadil alone? I think not. \\n\\nI think that in the end, if all else is conquered, Bombadil will fall, Last \\nas he was First; and then Night will come.\\' \\n\\n\\'I know little of Iarwain save the name,\\' said Galdor; \\'but Glorfindel, \\n\\nI think, is right. Power to defy our Enemy is not in him, unless such power \\nis in the earth itself. And yet we see that Sauron can torture and destroy \\nthe very hills. What power still remains lies with us, here in Imladris, or \\nwith Cirdan at the Havens, or in Lurien. But have they the strength, have we \\nhere the strength to withstand the Enemy, the coming of Sauron at the last, \\nwhen all else is overthrown?\\' \\n\\n\\'I have not the strength,\\' said Elrond; \\'neither have they.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then if the Ring cannot be kept from him for ever by strength\\' said \\nGlorfindel, \\'two things only remain for us to attempt: to send it over the \\nSea, or to destroy it.\\' \\n\\n\\'But Gandalf has revealed to us that we cannot destroy it by any craft \\nthat we here possess,\\' said Elrond. \\'And they who dwell beyond the Sea would \\nnot receive it: for good or ill it belongs to Middle-earth; it is for us who \\nstill dwell here to deal with it.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then, said Glorfindel, \\'let us cast it into the deeps, and so make the \\nlies of Saruman come true. For it is clear now that even at the Council his \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfeet were already on a crooked path. He knew that the Ring was not lost for \\never, but wished us to think so; for he began to lust for it for himself. \\n\\nYet oft in lies truth is hidden: in the Sea it would be safe.\\' \\n\\n\\'Not safe for ever,\\' said Gandalf. \\'There are many things in the deep \\nwaters; and seas and lands may change. And it is not our part here to take \\nthought only for a season, or for a few lives of Men, or for a passing age \\nof the world. We should seek a final end of this menace, even if we do not \\nhope to make one.\\' \\n\\n\\'And that we shall not find on the roads to the Sea,\\' said Galdor. \\'If \\nthe return to Iarwain be thought too dangerous, then flight to the S,a is \\nnow fraught with gravest peril. My heart tells me that Sauron will expect us \\nto take the western way, when he learns what has befallen. He soon will. The \\nNine have been unhorsed indeed but that is but a respite, ere they find new \\nsteeds and swifter. Only the waning might of Gondor stands now between him \\nand a march in power along the coasts into the North; and if he comes, \\nassailing the White Towers and the Havens, hereafter the Elves may have no \\nescape from the lengthening shadows of Middle-earth.\\' \\n\\n\\'Long yet will that march be delayed,\\' said Boromir. \\'Gondor wanes, you \\nsay. But Gondor stands, and even the end of its strength is still very \\nstrong.\\' \\n\\n\\'And yet its vigilance can no longer keep back the Nine,\\' said Galdor. \\n\\n\\'And other roads he may find that Gondor does not guard.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then,\\' said Erestor, \\'there are but two courses, as Glorfindel already \\nhas declared: to hide the Ring for ever; or to unmake it. But both are \\nbeyond our power. Who will read this riddle for us?\\' \\n\\n\\'None here can do so,\\' said Elrond gravely. \\'At least none can foretell \\nwhat will come to pass, if we take this road or that. But it seems to me now \\nclear which is the road that we must take. The westward road seems easiest. \\nTherefore it must be shunned. It will be watched. Too often the Elves have \\nfled that way. Now at this last we must take a hard road, a road unforeseen. \\nThere lies our hope, if hope it be. To walk into peril-to Mordor. We must \\nsend the Ring to the Fire.\\' \\n\\nSilence fell again. Frodo, even in that fair house, looking out upon a \\nsunlit valley filled with the noise of clear waters, felt a dead darkness in \\nhis heart. Boromir stirred, and Frodo looked at him. He was fingering his \\ngreat horn and frowning. At length he spoke. \\n\\n\\'I do not understand all this,\\' he said. \\'Saruman is a traitor, but did \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhe not have a glimpse of wisdom? Why do you speak ever of hiding and \\ndestroying? Why should we not think that the Great Ring has come into our \\nhands to serve us in the very hour of need? Wielding it the Free Lords of \\nthe Free may surely defeat the Enemy. That is what he most fears, I deem. \\n\\nThe Men of Gondor are valiant, and they will never submit; but they \\nmay be beaten down. Valour needs first strength, and then a weapon. Let the \\nRing be your weapon, if it has such power as you say. Take it and go forth \\nto victory!\\' \\n\\n\\'Alas, no,\\' said Elrond. \\'We cannot use the Ruling Ring. That we now \\nknow too well. It belongs to Sauron and was made by him alone, and is \\naltogether evil. Its strength, Boromir, is too great for anyone to wield at \\nwill, save only those who have already a great power of their own. But for \\nthem it holds an even deadlier peril. The very desire of it corrupts the \\nheart. Consider Saruman. If any of the Wise should with this Ring overthrow \\nthe Lord of Mordor, using his own arts, he would then set himself on \\nSauron\\'s throne, and yet another Dark Lord would appear. And that is another \\nreason why the Ring should be destroyed: as long as it is in the world it \\nwill be a danger even to the Wise. For nothing is evil in the beginning. \\nEven Sauron was not so. I fear to take the Ring to hide it. I will not take \\nthe Ring to wield it.\\' \\n\\n\\'Nor I,\\' said Gandalf. \\n\\nBoromir looked at them doubtfully, but he bowed his head. \\'So be it,\\' \\nhe said. \\'Then in Gondor we must trust to such weapons as we have. And at \\nthe least, while the Wise ones guard this Ring, we will fight on. Mayhap the \\nSword-that-was-Broken may still stem the tide -- if the hand that wields it \\nhas inherited not an heirloom only, but the sinews of the Kings of Men.\\' \\n\\n\\'Who can tell?\\' said Aragorn. \\'But we will put it to the test one day.\\' \\n\\n\\'May the day not be too long delayed,\\' said Boromir. \\'For though I do \\nnot ask for aid, we need it. It would comfort us to know that others fought \\nalso with all the means that they have.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then be comforted,\\' said Elrond. \\'For there are other powers and \\nrealms that you know not, and they are hidden from you. Anduin the Great \\nflows past many shores, ere it comes to Argonath and the Gates of Gondor.\\' \\n\\n\\'Still it might be well for all,\\' said Gluin the Dwarf, \\'if all these \\nstrengths were joined, and the powers of each were used in league. Other \\nrings there may be, less treacherous, that might be used in our need. The \\nSeven are lost to us -- if Balin has not found the ring of Thrur which was \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe last; naught has been heard of it since Thrur perished in Moria. Indeed \\nI may now reveal that it was partly in hope to find that ring that Balin \\nwent away.\\' \\n\\n\\'Balin will find no ring in Moria,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Thrur gave it to \\nThrbin his son, but not Thrbin to Thorin. It was taken with torment from \\nThrbin in the dungeons of Dol Guldur. I came too late.\\' \\n\\n\\'Ah, alas!\\' cried Gluin. \\'When will the day come of our revenge? But \\nstill there are the Three. What of the Three Rings of the Elves? Very mighty \\nRings, it is said. Do not the Elf-lords keep them? Yet they too were made by \\nthe Dark Lord long ago. Are they idle? I see Elf-lords here. Will they not \\nsay?\\' \\n\\nThe Elves returned no answer. \\'Did you not hear me, Gluin?\\' said \\nElrond. \\'The Three were not made by Sauron, nor did he ever touch them. But \\nof them it is not permitted to speak. So much only in this\\' hour of doubt I \\nmay now say. They are not idle. But they were not made as weapons of war or \\nconquest: that is not their power. Those who made them did not desire \\nstrength or domination or hoarded wealth, but understanding, making, and \\nhealing, to preserve all things unstained. These things the Elves of \\nMiddle-earth have in some measure gained, though with sorrow. But all that \\nhas been wrought by those who wield the Three will turn to their undoing, \\nand their minds and hearts will become revealed to Sauron, if he regains the \\nOne. It would be better if the Three had never been. That is his purpose.\\' \\n\\n\\'But what then would happen, if the Ruling Ring were destroyed as you \\ncounsel?\\' asked Gluin. \\n\\n\\'We know not for certain,\\' answered Elrond sadly. \\'Some hope that the \\nThree Rings, which Sauron has never touched, would then become free, and \\ntheir rulers might heal the hurts of the world that he has wrought. But \\nmaybe when the One has gone, the Three will fail, and many fair things will \\nfade and be forgotten. That is my belief.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yet all the Elves are willing to endure this chance,\\' said Glorfindel \\n\\'if by it the power of Sauron may be broken, and the fear of his dominion be \\ntaken away for ever.\\' \\n\\n\\'Thus we return once more to the destroying of the Ring,\\' said Erestor, \\n\\n\\'and yet we come no nearer. What strength have we for the finding of the \\nFire in which it was made? That is the path of despair. Of folly I would \\nsay, if the long wisdom of Elrond did not forbid me.\\' \\n\\n\\'Despair, or folly?\\' said Gandalf. \\'It is not despair, for despair is \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nonly for those who see the end beyond all doubt. We do not. It is wisdom to \\nrecognize necessity, when all other courses have been weighed, though as \\nfolly it may appear to those who cling to false hope. Well, let folly be our \\ncloak, a veil before the eyes of the Enemy! For he is very wise, and weighs \\nall things to a nicety in the scales of his malice. But the only measure \\nthat he knows is desire, desire for power; and so he judges all hearts. Into \\nhis heart the thought will not enter that any will refuse it, that having \\nthe Ring we may seek to destroy it. If we seek this, we shall put him out of \\nreckoning.\\' \\n\\n\\'At least for a while,\\' said Elrond. \\'The road must be trod, but it \\nwill be very hard. And neither strength nor wisdom will carry us far upon \\nit. This quest may be attempted by the weak with as much hope as the strong. \\nYet such is oft the course of deeds that move the wheels of the world: small \\nhands do them because they must, while the eyes of the great are elsewhere.\\' \\n\\n\\'Very well, very well, Master Elrond!\\' said Bilbo suddenly. \\'Say no \\nmore! It is plain enough what you are pointing at. Bilbo the silly hobbit \\nstarted this affair, and Bilbo had better finish it, or himself. I was very \\ncomfortable here, and getting on with my book. If you want to know, I am \\njust writing an ending for it. I had thought of putting: and he lived \\nhappily ever afterwards to the end of his days. It is a good ending, and \\nnone the worse for having been used before. Now I shall have to alter that: \\nit does not look like coming true; and anyway there will evidently have to \\nbe several more chapters, if I live to write them. It is a frightful \\nnuisance. When ought I to start? \\n\\n\\' Boromir looked in surprise at Bilbo, but the laughter died on his \\nlips when he saw that all the others regarded the old hobbit with grave \\nrespect. Only Gluin smiled, but his smile came from old memories. \\n\\n\\'Of course, my dear Bilbo,\\' said Gandalf. \\'If you had really started \\nthis affair, you might be expected to finish it. But you know well enough \\nnow that starting is too great a claim for any, and that only a small part \\nis played in great deeds by any hero. You need not bow! Though the word was \\nmeant, and we do not doubt that under jest you are making a valiant offer. \\n\\nBut one beyond your strength, Bilbo. You cannot take this thing back. It has \\npassed on. If you need my advice any longer, I should say that your part is \\nended, unless as a recorder. Finish your book, and leave the ending \\nunaltered! There is still hope for it. But get ready to write a sequel, when \\nthey come back.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBilbo laughed. \\'I have never known you give me pleasant advice before.\\' \\nhe said. \\'As all your unpleasant advice has been good, I wonder if this \\nadvice is not bad. Still, I don\\'t suppose I have the strength or luck left \\nto deal with the Ring. It has grown, and I have not. But tell me: what do \\nyou mean by they? \\n\\n\\'The messengers who are sent with the Ring.\\' \\n\\n\\'Exactly! And who are they to be? That seems to me what this Council \\nhas to decide, and all that it has to decide. Elves may thrive on speech \\nalone, and Dwarves endure great weariness; but I am only an old hobbit, and \\nI miss my meal at noon. Can\\'t you think of some names now? Or put it off \\ntill after dinner?\\' \\n\\nNo one answered. The noon-bell rang. Still no one spoke. Frodo glanced \\nat all the faces, but they were not turned to him. All the Council sat with \\ndowncast eyes, as if in deep thought. A great dread fell on him, as if he \\nwas awaiting the pronouncement of some doom that he had long foreseen and \\nvainly hoped might after all never be spoken. An overwhelming longing to \\nrest and remain at peace by Bilbo\\'s side in Rivendell filled all his heart. \\n\\nAt last with an effort he spoke, and wondered to hear his own words, as if \\nsome other will was using his small voice. \\n\\n\\'I will take the Ring,\\' he said, \\'though I do not know the way.\\' \\n\\nElrond raised his eyes and looked at him, and Frodo felt his heart \\npierced by the sudden keenness of the glance. \\'If I understand aright all \\nthat I have heard,\\' he said, \\'I think that this task is appointed for you, \\n\\nFrodo; and that if you do not find a way, no one will. This is the hour of \\nthe Shire-folk, when they arise from their quiet fields to shake the towers \\nand counsels of the Great. Who of all the Wise could have foreseen it? Or, \\nif they are wise, why should they expect to know it, until the hour has \\nstruck? \\n\\n\\'But it is a heavy burden. So heavy that none could lay it on another. \\n\\nI do not lay it on you. But if you take it freely, I will say that your \\nchoice is right; and though all the mighty elf-friends of old, Hador, and \\nH(r)rin, and T(r)rin, and Beren himself were assembled together your seat \\nshould \\n\\nbe among them.\\' \\n\\n\\'But you won\\'t send him off alone surely, Master?\\' cried Sam, unable to \\ncontain himself any longer, and jumping up from the corner where he had been \\nquietly sitting on the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'No indeed!\\' said Elrond, turning towards him with a smile. \\'You at \\nleast shall go with him. It is hardly possible to separate you from him, \\neven when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not.\\' \\n\\nSam sat down, blushing and muttering. \\'A nice pickle we have landed \\nourselves in, Mr. Frodo!\\' he said, shaking his head. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 3 . The Ring Goes South \\n\\n\\n\\nLater that day the hobbits held a meeting of their own in Bilbo\\'s room. \\nMerry and Pippin were indignant when they heard that Sam had crept into the \\nCouncil, and had been chosen as Frodo\\'s companion. \\n\\n\\'It\\'s most unfair,\\' said Pippin. \\'Instead of throwing him out, and \\nclapping him in chains, Elrond goes and rewards him for his cheek!\\' \\n\\n\\'Rewards!\\' said Frodo. \\'I can\\'t imagine a more severe punishment. You \\nare not thinking what you are saying: condemned to go on this hopeless \\njourney, a reward? Yesterday I dreamed that my task was done, and I could \\nrest here, a long while, perhaps for good.\\' \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t wonder,\\' said Merry, \\'and I wish you could. But we are envying \\nSam, not you. If you have to go, then it will be a punishment for any of us \\nto be left behind, even in Rivendell. We have come a long way with you and \\nbeen through some stiff times. We want to go on.\\' \\n\\n\\'That\\'s what I meant,\\' said Pippin. \\'We hobbits ought to stick \\ntogether, and we will. I shall go, unless they chain me up. There must be \\nsomeone with intelligence in the party.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then you certainly will not be chosen, Peregrin Took!\\' said Gandalf, \\nlooking in through the window, which was near the ground. \\'But you are all \\nworrying yourselves unnecessarily. Nothing is decided yet.\\' \\n\\n\\'Nothing decided!\\' cried Pippin. \\'Then what were you all doing? You \\nwere shut up for hours.\\' \\n\\n\"Talking,\\' said Bilbo. \\'There was a deal of talk, and everyone had an \\neye-opener. Even old Gandalf. I think Legolas\\'s bit of news about Gollum \\ncaught even him on the hop, though he passed it off.\\' \\n\\n\\'You were wrong,\\' said Gandalf. \\'You were inattentive. I had already \\nheard of it from Gwaihir. If you want to know, the only real eye-openers, as \\nyou put it, were you and Frodo; and I was the only one that was not \\nsurprised.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, anyway,\\' said Bilbo, \\'nothing was decided beyond choosing poor \\nFrodo and Sam. I was afraid all the time that it might come to that, if I \\nwas let off. But if you ask me, Elrond will send out a fair number, when the \\nreports come in. Have they started yet, Gandalf?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said the wizard. \\'Some of the scouts have been sent out already. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore will go tomorrow. Elrond is sending Elves, and they will get in touch \\nwith the Rangers, and maybe with Thranduil\\'s folk in Mirkwood. And \\nAragorn \\n\\nhas gone with Elrond\\'s sons. We shall have to scour the lands all round for \\nmany long leagues before any move is made. So cheer up, Frodo! You will \\nprobably make quite along stay here.\\' \\n\\n\\'Ah!\\' said Sam gloomily. \\'We\\'ll just wait long enough for winter to \\ncome.\\' \\n\\n\\'That can\\'t be helped,\\' said Bilbo. \\'It\\'s your fault partly, Frodo my \\nlad: insisting on waiting for my birthday. A funny way of honouring it, I \\ncan\\'t help thinking. Not the day I should have chosen for letting the S.-B.s \\ninto Bag End. But there it is: you can\\'t wait now fill spring; and you can\\'t \\ngo till the reports come back. \\n\\nWhen winter first begins to bite \\nand stones crack in the frosty night, \\nwhen pools are black and trees are bare, \\n\\n\\'tis evil in the Wild to fare. \\n\\nBut that I am afraid will be just your luck.\\' \\n\\n\\'I am afraid it will,\\' said Gandalf. \\'We can\\'t start until we have \\nfound out about the Riders.\\' \\n\\nT thought they were all destroyed in the flood,\\' said Merry. \\n\\n\\'You cannot destroy Ringwraiths like that,\\' said Gandalf. \\'The power of \\ntheir master is in them, and they stand or fall by him. We hope that they \\nwere all unhorsed and unmasked, and so made for a while less dangerous; but \\nwe must find out for certain. In the meantime you should try and forget your \\ntroubles, Frodo. I do not know if I can do anything to help you; but I will \\nwhisper this in your ears. Someone said that intelligence would be needed in \\nthe party. He was right. I think I shall come with you.\\' \\n\\nSo great was Frodo\\'s delight at this announcement that Gandalf left the \\nwindow-sill, where he had been sitting, and took off his hat and bowed. \\'I \\nonly said I think I shall come. Do not count on anything yet. In this matter \\nElrond will have much to say, and your friend the Strider. Which reminds me, \\nI want to see Elrond. I must be off.\\' \\n\\n\\'How long do you think I shall have here?\\' said Frodo to Bilbo when \\nGandalf had gone. \\n\\n\\'Oh, I don\\'t know. I can\\'t count days in Rivendell,\\' said Bilbo. \\'But \\nquite long, I should think. We can have many a good talk. What about helping \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nme with my book, and making a start on the next? Have you thought of an \\nending?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, several, and all are dark and unpleasant,\\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'Oh, that won\\'t do!\\' said Bilbo. \\'Books ought to have good endings. How \\nwould this do: and they all settled down and lived together happily ever \\nafter?\\' \\n\\n\\'It will do well, if it ever comes to that,\\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'Ah!\\' said Sam. \\'And where will they live? That\\'s what I often wonder.\\' \\n\\nFor a while the hobbits continued to talk and think of the past journey \\nand of the perils that lay ahead; but such was the virtue of the land of \\nRivendell that soon all fear and anxiety was lifted from their minds. The \\nfuture, good or ill, was not forgotten, but ceased to have any power over \\nthe present. Health and hope grew strong in them, and they were content with \\neach good day as it came, taking pleasure in every meal, and in every word \\nand song. \\n\\nSo the days slipped away, as each morning dawned bright and fair, and \\neach evening followed cool and clear. But autumn was waning fast; slowly the \\ngolden light faded to pale silver, and the lingering leaves fell from the \\nnaked trees. A wind began to blow chill from the Misty Mountains to the \\neast. The Hunter\\'s Moon waxed round in the night sky, and put to flight all \\nthe lesser stars. But low in the South one star shone red. Every night, as \\nthe Moon waned again, it shone brighter and brighter. Frodo could see it \\nfrom his window, deep in the heavens burning like a watchful eye that glared \\nabove the trees on the brink of the valley. \\n\\nThe hobbits had been nearly two months in the House of Elrond, and \\nNovember had gone by with the last shreds of autumn, and December was \\npassing, when the scouts began to return. Some had gone north beyond the \\nsprings of the Hoarwell into the Ettenmoors; and others had gone west, and \\nwith the help of Aragorn and the Rangers had searched the lands far down the \\nGreyflood, as far as Tharbad, where the old North Road crossed the river by \\na ruined town. Many had gone east and south; and some of these had crossed \\nthe Mountains and entered Mirkwood, while others had climbed the pass at the \\nsource of the Gladden River, and had come down into Wilderland and over the \\nGladden Fields and so at length had reached the old home of Radagast at \\nRhosgobel. Radagast was not there; and they had returned over the high pass \\nthat was called the Dimrill Stair. The sons of Elrond, Elladan and Elrohir, \\nwere the last to return; they had made a great journey, passing down the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSilverlode into a strange country, but of their errand they would not speak \\nto any save to Elrond. \\n\\nIn no region had the messengers discovered any signs or tidings of the \\nRiders or other servants of the Enemy. Even from the Eagles of the Misty \\nMountains they had learned no fresh news. Nothing had been seen or heard of \\nGollum; but the wild wolves were still gathering, and were hunting again far \\nup the Great River. Three of the black horses had been found at once drowned \\nin the flooded Ford. On the rocks of the rapids below it searchers \\ndiscovered the bodies of five more, and also a long black cloak, slashed and \\ntattered. Of the Black Riders no other trace was to be seen, and nowhere was \\ntheir presence to be felt. It seemed that they had vanished from the North. \\n\\n\\'Eight out of the Nine are accounted for at least,\\' said Gandalf. \\'It \\nis rash to be too sure, yet I think that we may hope now that the \\nRingwraiths were scattered, and have been obliged to return as best they \\ncould to their Master in Mordor, empty and shapeless. \\n\\nTf that is so, it will be some time before they can begin the hunt \\nagain. Of course the Enemy has other servants, but they will have to journey \\nall the way to the borders of Rivendell before they can pick up our trail. \\n\\nAnd if we are careful that will be hard to find. But we must delay no \\nlonger.\\' \\n\\nElrond summoned the hobbits to him. He looked gravely at Frodo. \\'The \\ntime has come,\\' he said. \\'If the Ring is to set out, it must go soon. But \\nthose who go with it must not count on their errand being aided by war or \\nforce. They must pass into the domain of the Enemy far from aid. Do you \\nstill hold to your word, Frodo, that you will be the Ring-bearer?\\' \\n\\n\\'I do,\\' said Frodo. \\'I will go with Sam.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then I cannot help you much, not even with counsel,\\' said Elrond. \\'I \\ncan foresee very little of your road; and how your task is to be achieved I \\ndo not know. The Shadow has crept now to the feet of the Mountains, and \\ndraws nigh even to the borders of Greyflood; and under the Shadow all is \\ndark to me. You will meet many foes, some open, and some disguised; and \\nyou \\n\\nmay find friends upon your way when you least look for it. I will send out \\nmessages, such as I can contrive, to those whom I know in the wide world; \\nbut so perilous are the lands now become that some may well miscarry, or \\ncome no quicker than you yourself. \\n\\n\\'And I will choose you companions to go with you, as far as they will \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nor fortune allows. The number must be few, since your hope is in speed and \\nsecrecy. Had I a host of Elves in armour of the Elder Days, it would avail \\nlittle, save to arouse the power of Mordor. \\n\\n\\'The Company of the Ring shall be Nine; and the Nine Walkers shall be \\nset against the Nine Riders that are evil. With you and your faithful \\nservant, Gandalf will go; for this shall be his great task, and maybe the \\nend of his labours. \\n\\n\\'For the rest, they shall represent the other Free Peoples of the \\nWorld: Elves, Dwarves, and Men. Legolas shall be for the Elves; and Gimli \\nson of Gluin for the Dwarves. They are willing to go at least to the passes \\nof the Mountains, and maybe beyond. For men you shall have Aragorn son of \\nArathorn, for the Ring of Isildur concerns him closely.\\' \\n\\n\\'Strider!\\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' he said with a smile. \\'I ask leave once again to be your \\ncompanion, Frodo.\\' \\n\\n\\'I would have begged you to come,\\' said Frodo, \\'only I thought you were \\ngoing to Minas Tirith with Boromir.\\' \\n\\n\\'I am,\\' said Aragorn. \\'And the Sword-that-was-Broken shall be reforged \\nere I set out to war. But your road and our road lie together for many \\nhundreds of miles. Therefore Boromir will also be in the Company. He is a \\nvaliant man.\\' \\n\\n\\'There remain two more to be found,\\' said Elrond. \"These I will \\nconsider. Of my household I may find some that it seems good to me to send.\\' \\n\\n\\'But that will leave no place for us!\\' cried Pippin in dismay. \\'We \\ndon\\'t want to be left behind. We want to go with Frodo.\\' \\n\\n\\'That is because you do not understand and cannot imagine what lies \\nahead,\\' said Elrond. \\n\\n\\'Neither does Frodo,\\' said Gandalf, unexpectedly supporting Pippin. \\n\\n\\'Nor do any of us see clearly. It is true that if these hobbits understood \\nthe danger, they would not dare to go. But they would still wish to go, or \\nwish that they dared, and be shamed and unhappy. I think, Elrond, that in \\nthis matter it would be well to trust rather to their friendship than to \\ngreat wisdom. Even if you chose for us an elf-lord, such as Glorfindel, he \\ncould not storm the Dark Tower, nor open the road to the Fire by the power \\nthat is in him.\\' \\n\\n\\'You speak gravely,\\' said Elrond, \\'but I am in doubt. The Shire, I \\nforebode, is not free now from peril; and these two I had thought to send \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nback there as messengers, to do what they could, according to the fashion of \\ntheir country, to warn the people of their danger. In any case, I judge that \\nthe younger of these two, Peregrin Took, should remain. My heart is against \\nhis going.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then, Master Elrond, you will have to lock me in prison, or send me \\nhome tied in a sack,\\' said Pippin. \\'For otherwise I shall follow the \\nCompany.\\' \\n\\n\\'Let it be so then. You shall go,\\' said Elrond, and he sighed. \\'Now the \\ntale of Nine is filled. In seven days the Company must depart.\\' \\n\\nThe Sword of Elendil was forged anew by Elvish smiths, and on its blade \\nwas traced a device of seven stars set between the crescent Moon and the \\nrayed Sun, and about them was written many runes; for Aragorn son of \\nArathorn was going to war upon the marches of Mordor. Very bright was that \\nsword when it was made whole again; the light of the sun shone redly in it, \\nand the light of the moon shone cold, and its edge was hard and keen. And \\nAragorn gave it a new name and called it And(r)ril, Flame of the West. \\n\\nAragorn and Gandalf walked together or sat speaking of their road and \\nthe perils they would meet; and they pondered the storied and figured maps \\nand books of lore that were in the house of Elrond. Sometimes Frodo was with \\nthem; but he was content to lean on their guidance, and he spent as much \\ntime as he could with Bilbo. \\n\\nIn those last days the hobbits sat together in the evening in the Hall \\nof Fire, and there among many tales they heard told in full the lay of Beren \\nand L(r)thien and the winning of the Great Jewel; but in the day, while Merry \\nand Pippin were out and about, Frodo and Sam were to be found with Bilbo in \\nhis own small room. Then Bilbo would read passages from his book (which \\nstill seemed very incomplete), or scraps of his verses, or would take notes \\nof Frodo\\'s adventures. \\n\\nOn the morning of the last day Frodo was alone with Bilbo, and the old \\nhobbit pulled out from under his bed a wooden box. He lifted the lid and \\nfumbled inside. \\n\\n\\'Here is your sword,\\' he said. \\'But it was broken, you know. I took it \\nto keep it safe but I\\'ve forgotten to ask if the smiths could mend it. No \\ntime now.. So I thought, perhaps, you would care to have this, don\\'t you \\nknow?\\' \\n\\nHe took from the box a small sword in an old shabby leathern scabbard. \\nThen he drew it, and its polished and well-tended blade glittered suddenly, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncold and bright. This is Sting,\\' he said, and thrust it with little effort \\ndeep into a wooden beam. \\'Take it, if you like. I shan\\'t want it again, I \\nexpect.\\' \\n\\nFrodo accepted it gratefully. \\n\\n\\'Also there is this!\\' said Bilbo, bringing out a parcel which seemed to \\nbe rather heavy for its size. He unwound several folds of old cloth, and \\nheld up a small shirt of mail. It was close-woven of many rings, as supple \\nalmost as linen, cold as ice, and harder than steel. It shone like moonlit \\nsilver, and was studded with white gems. With it was a belt of pearl and \\ncrystal. \\n\\n\\'It\\'s a pretty thing, isn\\'t it?\\' said Bilbo, moving it in the light. \\n\\n\\'And useful. It is my dwarf-mail that Thorin gave me. I got it back from \\nMichel Delving before I started, and packed it with my luggage: I brought \\nall the mementoes of my Journey away with me, except the Ring. But I did not \\nexpect to use this, and I don\\'t need it now, except to look at sometimes. \\n\\nYou hardly feel any weight when you put it on.\\' \\n\\n\\'I should look -- well, I don\\'t think I should look right in it,\\' said \\nFrodo. \\n\\n\\'Just what I said myself,\\' said Bilbo. \\'But never mind about looks. You \\ncan wear it under your outer clothes. Come on! You must share this secret \\nwith me. Don\\'t tell anybody else! But I should feel happier if I knew you \\nwere wearing it. I have a fancy it would turn even the knives of the Black \\nRiders,\\' he ended in a low voice. \\n\\n\\'Very well, I will take it,\\' said Frodo. Bilbo put it on him, and \\nfastened Sting upon the glittering belt; and then Frodo put over the top his \\nold weather-stained breeches, tunic, and jacket. \\n\\n\\'Just a plain hobbit you look,\\' said Bilbo. \\'But there is more about \\nyou now than appears on the surface. Good luck to you!\\' He turned away and \\nlooked out of the window, trying to hum a tune. \\n\\n\\'I cannot thank you as I should, Bilbo, for this, and for all our past \\nkindnesses,\\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'Don\\'t try!\\' said the old hobbit, turning round and slapping him on the \\nback. \\'Ow!\\' he cried. \\'You are too hard now to slap! But there you are: \\nHobbits must stick together, and especially Bagginses. All I ask in return \\nis: take as much care of yourself as you can. and bring back all the news \\nyou can, and any old songs and tales you can come by. I\\'ll do my best to \\nfinish my book before you return. I should like to write the second book, if \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI am spared.\\' He broke off and turned to the window again, singing softly. \\n\\n\\n\\nI sit beside the fire and think \\nof all that I have seen, \\nof meadow-flowers and butterflies \\nin summers that have been; \\n\\nOf yellow leaves and gossamer \\nin autumns that there were, \\nwith morning mist and silver sun \\nand wind upon my hair. \\n\\nI sit beside the fire and think \\nof how the world will be \\nwhen winter comes without a spring \\nthat I shall ever see. \\n\\nFor still there are so many things \\nthat I have never seen: \\nin every wood in every spring \\nthere is a different green. \\n\\nI sit beside the fire and think \\nof people long ago, \\nand people who will see a world \\nthat I shall never know. \\n\\nBut all the while I sit and think \\nof times there were before, \\n\\nI listen for returning feet \\nand voices at the door. \\n\\nIt was a cold grey day near the end of December. The East Wind was \\nstreaming through the bare branches of the trees, and seething in the dark \\npines on the hills. Ragged clouds were hurrying overhead, dark and low. As \\nthe cheerless shadows of the early evening began to fall the Company made \\nready to set out. They were to start at dusk, for Elrond counselled them to \\n\\n\\n\\n\\njourney under cover of night as often as they could, until they were far \\nfrom Ri vendell. \\n\\n\\'You should fear the many eyes of the servants of Sauron,\\' he said. \\'I \\ndo not doubt that news of the discomfiture of the Riders has already reached \\nhim, and he will be filled with wrath. Soon now his spies on foot and wing \\nwill be abroad in the northern lands. Even of the sky above you must beware \\nas you go on your way.\\' \\n\\nThe Company took little gear of war, for their hope was in secrecy not \\nin battle. Aragorn had And(r)ril but no other weapon, and he went forth clad \\nonly in rusty green and brown, as a Ranger of the wilderness. Boromir had a \\nlong sword, in fashion like And(r)ril but of less lineage and he bore also a \\nshield and his war -horn. \\n\\n\\'Loud and clear it sounds in the valleys of the hills,\\' he said, \\'and \\nthen let all the foes of Gondor flee!\\' Putting it to his lips he blew a \\nblast, and the echoes leapt from rock to rock, and all that heard that voice \\nin Rivendell sprang to their feet. \\n\\nSlow should you be to wind that horn again, Boromir, said Elrond. \\n\\'until you stand once more on the borders of your land, and dire need is on \\nyou.\\' \\n\\n\\'Maybe,\\' said Boromir. \\'But always I have let my horn cry at setting \\nforth, and though thereafter we may walk in the shadows, I will not go forth \\nas a thief in the night.\\' \\n\\nGimli the dwarf alone wore openly a short shirt of steel-rings, for \\ndwarves make light of burdens; and in his belt was a broad-bladed axe. \\nLegolas had a bow and a quiver, and at his belt a long white knife. The \\nyounger hobbits wore the swords that they had taken from the barrow; but \\nFrodo took only Sting; and his mail-coat, as Bilbo wished, remained hidden. \\nGandalf bore his staff, but girt at his side was the elven-sword Glamdring, \\nthe mate of Orcrist that lay now upon the breast of Thorin under the Lonely \\nMountain. \\n\\nAll were well furnished by Elrond with thick warm clothes, and they had \\njackets and cloaks lined with fur. Spare food and clothes and blankets and \\nother needs were laden on a pony, none other than the poor beast that they \\nhad brought from Bree. \\n\\n?he stay in Rivendell had worked a great wonder of change on him: he \\nwas glossy and seemed to have the vigour of youth. It was Sam who had \\ninsisted on choosing him, declaring that Bill (as he called him) would pine, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nif he did not come. \\n\\n\\'That animal can nearly talk,\\' he said, \\'and would talk, if he stayed \\nhere much longer. He gave me a look as plain as Mr. Pippin could speak it: \\nif you don\\'t let me go with you, Sam, I\\'ll follow on my own.\\' So Bill was \\ngoing as the beast of burden, yet he was the only member of the Company that \\ndid not seem depressed. \\n\\nTheir farewells had been said in the great hall by the fire, and they \\nwere only waiting now for Gandalf, who had not yet come out of the house. A \\ngleam of firelight came from the open doors, and soft lights were glowing in \\nmany windows. Bilbo huddled in a cloak stood silent on the doorstep beside \\nFrodo. Aragorn sat with his head bowed to his knees; only Elrond knew fully \\nwhat this hour meant to him. The others could be seen as grey shapes in the \\ndarkness. \\n\\nSam was standing by the pony, sucking his teeth, and staring moodily \\ninto the gloom where the river roared stonily below; his desire for \\nadventure was at its lowest ebb. \\n\\n\\'Bill, my lad,\\' he said, \\'you oughtn\\'t to have took up with us. You \\ncould have stayed here and et the best hay till the new grass comes.\\' Bill \\nswished his tail and said nothing. \\n\\nSam eased the pack on his shoulders, and went over anxiously in his \\nmind all the things that he had stowed in it, wondering if he had forgotten \\nanything: his chief treasure, his cooking gear; and the little box of salt \\nthat he always carried and refilled when he could; a good supply of \\npipe- weed (but not near enough, I\\'ll warrant); flint and tinder; woollen \\nhose: linen; various small belongings of his master\\'s that Frodo had \\nforgotten and Sam had stowed to bring them out in triumph when they were \\ncalled for. He went through them all. \\n\\n\\'Rope!\\' he muttered. \\'No rope! And only last night you said to \\nyourself: \"Sam, what about a bit of rope? You\\'ll want it, if you haven\\'t got \\nit:\" Well, I\\'ll want it. I can\\'t get it now.\\' \\n\\nAt that moment Elrond came out with Gandalf, and he called the Company \\nto him. \\'This is my last word,\\' he said in a low voice. \\'The Ring-bearer is \\nsetting out on the Quest of Mount Doom. On him alone is any charge laid: \\nneither to cast away the Ring, nor to deliver it to any servant of the Enemy \\nnor indeed to let any handle it, save members of the Company and the \\nCouncil, and only then in gravest need. The others go with him as free \\ncompanions, to help him on his way. You may tarry, or come back, or turn \\n\\n\\n\\n\\naside into other paths, as chance allows. The further you go, the less easy \\nwill it be to withdraw; yet no oath or bond is laid on you to go further \\nthan you will. For you do not yet know the strength of your hearts, and you \\ncannot foresee what each may meet upon the road.\\' \\n\\n\\'Faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens,\\' said Gimli. \\n\\n\\'Maybe,\\' said Elrond, \\'but let him not vow to walk in the dark, who has \\nnot seen the nightfall.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yet sworn word may strengthen quaking heart,\\' said Gimli. \\n\\n\\'Or break it,\\' said Elrond. \\'Look not too far ahead! But go now with \\ngood hearts ! Farewell, and may the blessing of Elves and Men and all Free \\nFolk go with you. May the stars shine upon your faces!\\' \\n\\n\\'Good . . . good luck!\\' cried Bilbo, stuttering with the cold. \\'I don\\'t \\nsuppose you will be able to keep a diary, Frodo my lad, but I shall expect a \\nfull account when you get back. And don\\'t be too long! Farewell!\\' \\n\\nMany others of Elrond\\'s household stood in the shadows and watched them \\ngo, bidding them farewell with soft voices. There was no laughter, and no \\nsong or music. At last they turned away and faded silently into the dusk. \\n\\nThey crossed the bridge and wound slowly up the long steep paths that \\nled out of the cloven vale of Rivendell; and they came at length to the high \\nmoor where the wind hissed through the heather. Then with one glance at the \\nLast Flomely Flouse twinkling below them they strode away far into the night. \\n\\nAt the Ford of Bruinen they left the Road and turning southwards went \\non by narrow paths among the folded lands. Their purpose was to hold this \\ncourse west of the Mountains for many miles and days. The country was \\nmuch \\n\\nrougher and more barren than in the green vale of the Great River in \\nWilderland on the other side of the range, and their going would be slow; \\nbut they hoped in this way to escape the notice of unfriendly eyes. The \\nspies of Sauron had hitherto seldom been seen in this empty country, and the \\npaths were little known except to the people of Rivendell. \\n\\nGandalf walked in front, and with him went Aragorn, who knew this land \\neven in the dark. The others were in file behind, and Legolas whose eyes \\nwere keen was the rearguard. The first part of their journey was hard and \\ndreary, and Frodo remembered little of it, save the wind. For many sunless \\ndays an icy blast came from the Mountains in the east, and no garment seemed \\nable to keep out its searching fingers. Though the Company was well clad, \\nthey seldom felt warm, either moving or at rest. They slept uneasily during \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe middle of the day, in some hollow of the land, or hidden under the \\ntangled thorn-bushes that grew in thickets in many places. In the late \\nafternoon they were roused by the watch, and took their chief meal: cold and \\ncheerless as a rule, for they could seldom risk the lighting of a fire. In \\nthe evening they went on again, always as nearly southward as they could \\nfind a way. \\n\\nAt first it seemed to the hobbits that although they walked and \\nstumbled until they were weary, they were creeping forward like snails, and \\ngetting nowhere. Each day the land looked much the same as it had the day \\nbefore. Yet steadily the mountains were drawing nearer. South of Rivendell \\nthey rose ever higher, and bent westwards; and about the feet of the main \\nrange there was tumbled an ever wider land of bleak hills, and deep valleys \\nfilled with turbulent waters. Paths were few and winding, and led them often \\nonly to the edge of some sheer fall, or down into treacherous swamps. \\n\\nThey had been a fortnight on the way when the weather changed. The wind \\nsuddenly fell and then veered round to the south. The swift-flowing clouds \\nlifted and melted away, and the sun came out, pale and bright. There came a \\ncold clear dawn at the end of a long stumbling night-march. The travellers \\nreached a low ridge crowned with ancient holly -trees whose grey-green trunks \\nseemed to have been built out of the very stone of the hills. Their dark \\nleaves shone and their berries glowed red in the light of the rising sun. \\n\\nAway in the south Frodo could see the dim shapes of lofty mountains \\nthat seemed now to stand across the path that the Company was taking. At the \\nleft of this high range rose three peaks; the tallest and nearest stood up \\nlike a tooth tipped with snow; its great, bare, northern precipice was still \\nlargely in the shadow, but where the sunlight slanted upon it, it glowed \\nred. \\n\\nGandalf stood at Frodo\\'s side and looked out under his hand. \\'We have \\ndone well,\\' he said. \\'We have reached the borders of the country that Men \\ncall Hollin; many Elves lived here in happier days, when Eregion was its \\nname. Five-and-forty leagues as the crow flies we have come, though many \\nlong miles further our feet have walked. The land and the weather will be \\nmilder now, but perhaps all the more dangerous.\\' \\n\\n\\'Dangerous or not, a real sunrise is mighty welcome,\\' said Frodo, \\nthrowing back his hood and letting the morning light fall on his face. \\n\\n\\'But the mountains are ahead of us,\\' said Pippin. \\'We must have turned \\neastwards in the night.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'No,\\' said Gandalf. \\'But you see further ahead in the clear light. \\n\\nBeyond those peaks the range bends round south-west. There are many maps \\nin \\n\\nElrond\\'s house, but I suppose you never thought to look at them?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes I did, sometimes,\\' said Pippin, \\'but I don\\'t remember them. Frodo \\nhas a better head for that sort of thing.\\' \\n\\n\\'I need no map,\\' said Gimli, who had come up with Legolas, and was \\ngazing out before him with a strange light in his deep eyes. \\'There is the \\nland where our fathers worked of old, and we have wrought the image of those \\nmountains into many works of metal and of stone, and into many songs and \\ntales. They stand tall in our dreams: Baraz, Zirak, Shathyr. \\n\\n\\'Only once before have I seen them from afar in waking life, but I know \\nthem and their names, for under them lies Khazad-dym, the Dwarrowdelf, that \\nis now called the Black Pit, Moria in the Elvish tongue. Yonder stands \\nBarazinbar, the Redhorn, cruel Caradhras; and beyond him are Silvertine and \\nCloudyhead: Celebdil the White, and Fanuidhol the Grey, that we call \\nZirak-zigil and Bundushathyr. \\n\\n\\'There the Misty Mountains divide, and between their arms lies the \\ndeep-shadowed valley which we cannot forget: Azanulbizar, the Dimrill Dale, \\nwhich the Elves call Nanduhirion.\\' \\n\\n\\'It is for the Dimrill Dale that we are making,\\' said Gandalf. \\'If we \\nclimb the pass that is called the Redhorn Gate, under the far side of \\nCaradhras, we shall come down by the Dimrill Stair into the deep vale of the \\nDwarves. There lies the Mirrormere, and there the River Silverlode rises in \\nits icy springs.\\' \\n\\n\\'Dark is the water of Kheled-zvram,\\' said Gimli, \\'and cold are the \\nsprings of Kibil-nvla. My heart trembles at the thought that I may see them \\nsoon.\\' \\n\\n\\'May you have joy of the sight, my good dwarf f said Gandalf. \\'But \\nwhatever you may do, we at least cannot stay in that valley. We must go down \\nthe Silverlode into the secret woods, and so to the Great River, and then \\n\\nf \\n\\nHe paused. \\n\\n\\'Yes, and where then?\\' asked Merry. \\n\\n\\'To the end of the journey -- in the end,\\' said Gandalf. \\'We cannot \\nlook too far ahead. Let us be glad that the first stage is safely over. I \\nthink we will rest here, not only today but tonight as well. There is a \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwholesome air about Hollin. Much evil must befall a country before it wholly \\nforgets the Elves, if once they dwelt there.\\' \\n\\nThat is true,\\' said Legolas. \\'But the Elves of this land were of a \\nrace strange to us of the silvan folk, and the trees and the grass do not \\nnow remember them: Only I hear the stones lament them: deep they delved us, \\nfair they wrought us, high they builded us; but they are gone. They are \\ngone. They sought the Elavens long ago.\\' \\n\\nThat morning they lit a fire in a deep hollow shrouded by great bushes \\nof holly, and their supper -breakfast was merrier than it had been since they \\nset out. They did not hurry to bed afterwards, for they expected to have all \\nthe night to sleep in, and they did not mean to go on again until the \\nevening of the next day. Only Aragorn was silent and restless. After a while \\nhe left the Company and wandered on to the ridge; there he stood in the \\nshadow of a tree, looking out southwards and westwards, with his head posed \\nas if he was listening. Then he returned to the brink of the dell and looked \\ndown at the others laughing and talking. \\n\\n\\'What is the matter, Strider?\\' Merry called up. \\'What are you looking \\nfor? Do you miss the East Wind?\\' \\n\\n\\'No indeed,\\' he answered. \\'But I miss something. I have been in the \\ncountry of Hollin in many seasons. No folk dwell here now, but many other \\ncreatures live here at all times, especially birds. Yet now all things but \\nyou are silent. I can feel it. There is no sound for miles about us, and \\nyour voices seem to make the ground echo. I do not understand it.\\' \\n\\nGandalf looked up with sudden interest. \\'But what do you guess is the \\nreason?\\' he asked. \\'Is there more in it than surprise at seeing four \\nhobbits, not to mention the rest of us, where people are so seldom seen or \\nheard?\\' \\n\\n\\'I hope that is it,\\' answered Aragorn. \\'But I have a sense of \\nwatchfulness, and of fear, that I have never had here before.\\' \\n\\n\"Then we must be more careful,\\' said Gandalf. \\'If you bring a Ranger \\nwith you, it is well to pay attention to him, especially if the Ranger is \\nAragorn. We must stop talking aloud, rest quietly, and set the watch.\\' \\n\\nIt was Sam\\'s turn that day to take the first watch, but Aragorn joined \\nhim. The others fell asleep. Then the silence grew until even Sam felt it. \\n\\nThe breathing of the sleepers could be plainly heard. The swish of the \\npony\\'s tail and the occasional movements of his feet became loud noises. Sam \\ncould hear his own joints creaking, if he stirred. Dead silence was around \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhim, and over all hung a clear blue sky, as the Sun rode up from the East. \\nAway in the South a dark patch appeared, and grew, and drove north like \\nflying smoke in the wind. \\n\\n\\'What\\'s that, Strider? It don\\'t look like a cloud,\\' said Sam in a \\nwhisper to Aragorn. He made no answer, he was gazing intently at the sky; \\nbut before long Sam could see for himself what was approaching. Flocks of \\nbirds, flying at great speed, were wheeling and circling, and traversing all \\nthe land as if they were searching for something; and they were steadily \\ndrawing nearer. \\n\\n\\'Lie flat and still!\\' hissed Aragorn, pulling Sam down into the shade \\nof a holly -bush; for a whole regiment of birds had broken away suddenly from \\nthe main host, and came, flying low, straight towards the ridge. Sam thought \\nthey were a kind of crow of large size. As they passed overhead, in so dense \\na throng that their shadow followed them darkly over the ground below, one \\nharsh croak was heard. \\n\\nNot until they had dwindled into the distance, north and west, and the \\nsky was again clear would Aragorn rise. Then he sprang up and went and \\nwakened Gandalf. \\n\\n\\'Regiments of black crows are flying over all the land between the \\nMountains and the Greyflood,\\' he said, \\'and they have passed over Hollin. \\nThey are not natives here; they are crebain out of Fangorn and Dunland. I do \\nnot know what they are about: possibly there is some trouble away south from \\nwhich they are fleeing; but I think they are spying out the land. I have \\nalso glimpsed many hawks flying high up in the sky. I think we ought to move \\nagain this evening. Hollin is no longer wholesome for us: it is being \\nwatched.\\' \\n\\n\\'And in that case so is the Redhorn Gate,\\' said Gandalf; \\'and how we \\ncan get over that without being seen, I cannot imagine. But we will think of \\nthat when we must. As for moving as soon as it is dark, I am afraid that you \\nare right.\\' \\n\\n\\'Luckily our fire made little smoke, and had burned low before the \\ncrebain came,\\' said Aragorn. \\'It must be put out and not lit again.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well if that isn\\'t a plague and a nuisance!\\' said Pippin. The news: no \\nfire, and a move again by night, had been broken to him, as soon as he woke \\nin the late afternoon. \\'All because of a pack of crows! I had looked forward \\nto a real good meal tonight: something hot.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, you can go on looking forward,\\' said Gandalf. \\'There may be many \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nunexpected feasts ahead for you. For myself I should like a pipe to smoke in \\ncomfort, and warmer feet. However, we are certain of one thing at any rate: \\nit will get warmer as we get south.\\' \\n\\n\\'Too warm, I shouldn\\'t wonder,\\' muttered Sam to Frodo. \\'But I\\'m \\nbeginning to think it\\'s time we got a sight of that Fiery Mountain and saw \\nthe end of the Road, so to speak. I thought at first that this here Redhorn, \\nor whatever its name is, might be it, till Gimli spoke his piece. A fair \\njaw-cracker dwarf-language must be!\\' Maps conveyed nothing to Sam\\'s mind, \\nand all distances in these strange lands seemed so vast that he was quite \\nout of his reckoning. \\n\\nAll that day the Company remained in hiding. The dark birds passed over \\nnow and again; but as the westering Sun grew red they disappeared \\nsouthwards. At dusk the Company set out, and turning now half east they \\nsteered their course towards Caradhras, which far away still glowed faintly \\nred in the last light of the vanished Sun. One by one white stars sprang \\nforth as the sky faded. \\n\\nGuided by Aragorn they struck a good path. It looked to Frodo like the \\nremains of an ancient road, that had once been broad and well planned, from \\nHollin to the mountain-pass. The Moon, now at the full, rose over the \\nmountains, and cast a pale light in which the shadows of stones were black. \\nMany of them looked to have been worked by hands, though now they lay \\ntumbled and ruinous in a bleak, barren land. \\n\\nIt was the cold chill hour before the first stir of dawn, and the moon \\nwas low. Frodo looked up at the sky. Suddenly he saw or felt a shadow pass \\nover the high stars, as if for a moment they faded and then flashed out \\nagain. He shivered. \\n\\n\\'Did you see anything pass over?\\' he whispered to Gandalf, who was just \\nahead. \\n\\n\\'No, but I felt it, whatever it was,\\' he answered. \\'It may be nothing, \\nonly a wisp of thin cloud.\\' \\n\\n\\'It was moving fast then,\\' muttered Aragorn, \\'and not with the wind.\\' \\n\\nNothing further happened that night. The next morning dawned even \\nbrighter than before. But the air was chill again; already the wind was \\nturning back towards the east. For two more nights they marched on, climbing \\nsteadily but ever more slowly as their road wound up into the hills, and the \\nmountains towered up, nearer and nearer. On the third morning Caradhras rose \\nbefore them, a mighty peak, tipped with snow like silver, but with sheer \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnaked sides, dull red as if stained with blood. \\n\\nThere was a black look in the sky, and the sun was wan. The wind had \\ngone now round to the north-east. Gandalf snuffed the air and looked back. \\n\\n\\'Winter deepens behind us,\\' he said quietly to Aragorn. \\'The heights \\naway north are whiter than they were; snow is lying far down their \\nshoulders. Tonight we shall be on our way high up towards the Redhorn Gate. \\nWe may well be seen by watchers on that narrow path, and waylaid by some \\nevil; but the weather may prove a more deadly enemy than any. What do you \\nthink of your course now, Aragorn?\\' \\n\\nFrodo overheard these words, and understood that Gandalf and Aragorn \\nwere continuing some debate that had begun long before. He listened \\nanxiously. \\n\\n\\'I think no good of our course from beginning to end, as you know well, \\nGandalf,\\' answered Aragorn. \\'And perils known and unknown will grow as we \\ngo \\n\\non. But we must go on; and it is no good our delaying the passage of the \\nmountains. Further south there are no passes, till one comes to the Gap of \\nRohan. I do not trust that way since your news of Saruman. Who knows \\nwhich \\n\\nside now the marshals of the Horse-lords serve?\\' \\n\\n\\'Who knows indeed!\\' said Gandalf. \\'But there is another way, and not by \\nthe pass of Caradhras: the dark and secret way that we have spoken of.\\' \\n\\n\\'But let us not speak of it again! Not yet. Say nothing to the others I \\nbeg, not until it is plain that there is no other way.\\' \\n\\n\\'We must decide before we go further,\\' answered Gandalf. \\n\\n\\'Then let us weigh the matter in our minds, while the others rest and \\nsleep,\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\nIn the late afternoon, while the others were finishing their breakfast, \\n\\nGandalf and Aragorn went aside together and stood looking at Caradhras. Its \\nsides were now dark and sullen, and its head was in grey cloud. Frodo \\nwatched them, wondering which way the debate would go. When they returned \\nto \\n\\nthe Company Gandalf spoke, and then he knew that it had been decided to face \\nthe weather and the high pass. He was relieved. He could not guess what was \\nthe other dark and secret way, but the very mention of it had seemed to fill \\nAragorn with dismay, and Frodo was glad that it had been abandoned. \\n\\n\\'From signs that we have seen lately,\\' said Gandalf, \\'I fear that the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRedhorn Gate may be watched; and also I have doubts of the weather that is \\ncoming up behind. Snow may come. We must go with all the speed that we \\ncan. \\n\\nEven so it will take us more than two marches before we reach the top of the \\npass. Dark will come early this evening. We must leave as soon as you can \\nget ready.\\' \\n\\n\\'I will add a word of advice, if I may,\\' said Boromir. \\'I was born \\nunder the shadow of the White Mountains and know something of journeys \\nin \\n\\nthe high places. We shall meet bitter cold, if no worse, before we come down \\non the other side. It will not help us to keep so secret that we are frozen \\nto death. When we leave here, where there are still a few trees and bushes, \\neach of us should carry a faggot of wood, as large as he can bear.\\' \\n\\n\\'And Bill could take a bit more, couldn\\'t you lad?\\' said Sam. The pony \\nlooked at him mournfully. \\n\\n\\'Very well,\\' said Gandalf. \\'But we must not use the wood -- not unless \\nit is a choice between fire and death.\\' \\n\\nThe Company set out again with good speed at first; but soon their way \\nbecame steep and difficult. The twisting and climbing road had in many \\nplaces almost disappeared, and was blocked with many fallen stones. The \\nnight grew deadly dark under great clouds. A bitter wind swirled among the \\nrocks. By midnight they had climbed to the knees of the great mountains. The \\nnarrow path now wound under a sheer wall of cliffs to the left, above which \\nthe grim flanks of Caradhras towered up invisible in the gloom; on the right \\nwas a gulf of darkness where the land fell suddenly into a deep ravine. \\n\\nLaboriously they climbed a sharp slope and halted for a moment at the \\ntop. Frodo felt a soft touch on his face. He put out his arm and saw the dim \\nwhite flakes of snow settling on his sleeve. \\n\\nThey went on. But before long the snow was falling fast, filling all \\nthe air, and swirling into Frodo\\'s eyes. The dark bent shapes of Gandalf and \\nAragorn only a pace or two ahead could hardly be seen. \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t like this at all,\\' panted Sam just behind. \\'Snow\\'s all right \\non a fine morning, but I like to be in bed while it\\'s falling. I wish this \\nlot would go off to Hobbiton! Folk might welcome it there.\\' Except on the \\nhigh moors of the Northfarthing a heavy fall was rare in the Shire, and was \\nregarded as a pleasant event and a chance for fun. No living hobbit (save \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBilbo) could remember the Fell Winter of 131 1, when the white wolves \\ninvaded \\n\\nthe Shire over the frozen Brandywine. \\n\\nGandalf halted. Snow was thick on his hood and shoulders; it was \\nalready ankle-deep about his boots. \\n\\n\"This is what I feared,\\' he said. \\'What do you say now, Aragorn?\\' \\n\\n\\'That I feared it too,\\' Aragorn answered, \\'but less than other things. \\n\\nI knew the risk of snow, though it seldom falls heavily so far south, save \\nhigh up in the mountains. But we are not high yet; we are still far down, \\nwhere the paths are usually open all the winter.\\' \\n\\n\\'I wonder if this is a contrivance of the Enemy,\\' said Boromir. \"They \\nsay in my land that he can govern the storms in the Mountains of Shadow that \\nstand upon the borders of Mordor. He has strange powers and many allies.\\' \\n\\n\\'His arm has grown long indeed,\\' said Gimli, \\'if he can draw snow down \\nfrom the North to trouble us here three hundred leagues away.\\' \\n\\n\\'His arm has grown long,\\' said Gandalf. \\n\\nWhile they were halted, the wind died down, and the snow slackened \\nuntil it almost ceased. They tramped on again. But they had not gone more \\nthan a furlong when the storm returned with fresh fury. The wind whistled \\nand the snow became a blinding blizzard. Soon even Boromir found it hard to \\nkeep going. The hobbits, bent nearly double, toiled along behind the taller \\nfolk, but it was plain that they could not go much further, if the snow \\ncontinued. Frodo\\'s feet felt like lead. Pippin was dragging behind. Even \\nGimli, as stout as any dwarf could be, was grumbling as he trudged. \\n\\nThe Company halted suddenly, as if they had come to an agreement \\nwithout any words being spoken. They heard eerie noises in the darkness \\nround them. It may have been only a trick of the wind in the cracks and \\ngullies of the rocky wall, but the sounds were those of shrill cries, and \\nwild howls of laughter. Stones began to fall from the mountain-side, \\nwhistling over their heads, or crashing on the path beside them. Every now \\nand again they heard a dull rumble, as a great boulder rolled down from \\nhidden heights above. \\n\\n\\'We cannot go further tonight,\\' said Boromir. \\'Let those call it the \\nwind who will; there are fell voices on the air; and these stones are aimed \\nat us.\\' \\n\\n\\'I do call it the wind,\\' said Aragorn. \\'But that does not make what you \\nsay untrue. There are many evil and unfriendly things in the world that have \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nlittle love for those that go on two legs, and yet are not in league with \\nSauron, but have purposes of their own. Some have been in this world longer \\nthan he.\\' \\n\\n\\'Caradhras was called the Cruel, and had an ill name, said Gimli, \\'long \\nyears ago, when rumour of Sauron had not been heard in these lands.\\' \\n\\n\\'It matters little who is the enemy, if we cannot beat off his attack; \\nsaid Gandalf. \\n\\n\\'But what can we do?\\' cried Pippin miserably. He was leaning on Merry \\nand Frodo, and he was shivering. \\n\\n\\'Either stop where we are, or go back,\\' said Gandalf. \\'It is no good \\ngoing on. Only a little higher, if I remember rightly, this path leaves the \\ncliff and runs into a wide shallow trough at the bottom of a long hard \\nslope. We should have no shelter there from snow, or stones -- or anything \\nelse.\\' \\n\\n\\'And it is no good going back while the storm holds,\\' said Aragorn. \\'We \\nhave passed no place on the way up that offered more shelter than this \\ncliff-wall we are under now.\\' \\n\\n\\'Shelter!\\' muttered Sam. \\'If this is shelter, then one wall and no roof \\nmake a house.\\' \\n\\nThe Company now gathered together as close to the cliff as they could. \\n\\nIt faced southwards, and near the bottom it leaned out a little, so that \\nthey hoped it would give them some protection from the northerly wind and \\nfrom the falling stones. But eddying blasts swirled round them from every \\nside, and the snow flowed down in ever denser clouds. \\n\\nThey huddled together with their backs to the wall. Bill the pony stood \\npatiently but dejectedly in front of the hobbits, and screened them a \\nlittle; but before long the drifting snow was above his hocks, and it went \\non mounting. If they had had no larger companions the hobbits would soon \\nhave been entirely buried. \\n\\nA great sleepiness came over Frodo; he felt himself sinking fast into a \\nwarm and hazy dream. He thought a fire was heating his toes, and out of the \\nshadows on the other side of the hearth he heard Bilbo\\'s voice speaking. / \\ndon \\'t think much of your diary , he said. Snowstorms on January the twelfth: \\nthere was no need to come back to report that! \\n\\nBut I wanted rest and sleep, Bilbo , Frodo answered with an effort, when \\nhe felt himself shaken, and he came back painfully to wakefulness. Boromir \\nhad lifted him off the ground out of a nest of snow. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'This will be the death of the halflings, Gandalf,\\' said Boromir. \\'It \\nis useless to sit here until the snow goes over our heads. We must do \\nsomething to save ourselves.\\' \\n\\n\\'Give them this,\\' said Gandalf, searching in his pack and drawing out a \\nleathern flask. \\'Just a mouthful each -- for all of us. It is very precious. \\n\\nIt is miruvor, the cordial of Imladris. Elrond gave it to me at our parting. \\n\\nPass it round!\\' \\n\\nAs soon as Frodo had swallowed a little of the warm and fragrant liquor \\nhe felt a new strength of heart, and the heavy drowsiness left his limbs. \\n\\nThe others also revived and found fresh hope and vigour. But the snow did \\nnot relent. It whirled about them thicker than ever, and the wind blew \\nlouder. \\n\\n\\'What do you say to fire?\\' asked Boromir suddenly. \\'The choice seems \\nnear now between fire and death, Gandalf. Doubtless we shall be hidden from \\nall unfriendly eyes when the snow has covered us, but that will not help \\nus.\\' \\n\\n\\'You may make a fire, if you can,\\' answered Gandalf. \\'If there are any \\nwatchers that can endure this storm, then they can see us, fire or no.\\' But \\nthough they had brought wood and kindlings by the advice of Boromir, it \\npassed the skill of Elf or even Dwarf to strike a flame that would hold amid \\nthe swirling wind or catch in the wet fuel. At last reluctantly Gandalf \\nhimself took a hand. Picking up a faggot he held it aloft for a moment, and \\nthen with a word of command, naur an edraith ammen ! he thrust the end of his \\nstaff into the midst of it. At once a great spout of green and blue flame \\nsprang out, and the wood flared and sputtered. \\n\\n\\'If there are any to see, then I at least am revealed to them,\\' he \\nsaid. \\'I have written Gandalf is here in signs that all can read from \\nRivendell to the mouths of Anduin.\\' \\n\\nBut the Company cared no longer for watchers or unfriendly eyes. Their \\nhearts were rejoiced to see the light of the fire. The wood burned merrily; \\nand though all round it the snow hissed, and pools of slush crept under \\ntheir feet, they warmed their hands gladly at the blaze. There they stood, \\nstooping in a circle round the little dancing and blowing flames. A red \\nlight was on their tired and anxious faces; behind them the night was like a \\nblack wall. \\n\\nBut the wood was burning fast, and the snow still fell. \\n\\nThe fire burned low. and the last faggot was thrown on. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe night is getting old,\\' said Aragorn. \"The dawn is not far off.\\' \\n\\n\\'If any dawn can pierce these clouds,\\' said Gimli. \\n\\nBoromir stepped out of the circle and stared up into the blackness. \\n\\n\\'The snow is growing less,\\' he said, \\'and the wind is quieter.\\' \\n\\nFrodo gazed wearily at the flakes still falling out of the dark to be \\nrevealed white for a moment in the light of the dying fire; but for a long \\ntime he could see no sign of their slackening. Then suddenly, as sleep was \\nbeginning to creep over him again, he was aware that the wind had indeed \\nfallen, and the flakes were becoming larger and fewer. Very slowly a dim \\nlight began to grow. At last the snow stopped altogether. \\n\\nAs the light grew stronger it showed a silent shrouded world. Below \\ntheir refuge were white humps and domes and shapeless deeps beneath which \\nthe path that they had trodden was altogether lost; but the heights above \\nwere hidden in great clouds still heavy with the threat of snow. \\n\\nGimli looked up and shook his head. \\'Caradhras has not forgiven us.\\' he \\nsaid. \\'He has more snow yet to fling at us, if we go on. The sooner we go \\nback and down the better.\\' \\n\\nTo this all agreed, but their retreat was now difficult. It might well \\nprove impossible. Only a few paces from the ashes of their fire the snow lay \\nmany feet deep, higher than the heads of the hobbits; in places it had been \\nscooped and piled by the wind into great drifts against the cliff. \\n\\n\\'If Gandalf would go before us with a bright flame, he might melt a \\npath for you,\\' said Legolas. The storm had troubled him little, and he alone \\nof the Company remained still light of heart. \\n\\n\\'If Elves could fly over mountains, they might fetch the Sun to save \\nus,\\' answered Gandalf. \\'But I must have something to work on. I cannot burn \\nsnow.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well,\\' said Boromir, \\'when heads are at a loss bodies must serve, as \\nwe say in my country. The strongest of us must seek a way. See! Though all \\nis now snow-clad, our path, as we came up, turned about that shoulder of \\nrock down yonder. It was there that the snow first began to burden us. If we \\ncould reach that point, maybe it would prove easier beyond. It is no more \\nthan a furlong off, I guess.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then let us force a path thither, you and I!\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\nAragorn was the tallest of the Company, but Boromir, little less in \\nheight, was broader and heavier in build. He led the way, and Aragorn \\nfollowed him. Slowly they moved off, and were soon toiling heavily. In \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nplaces the snow was breast-high, and often Boromir seemed to be swimming \\nor \\n\\nburrowing with his great arms rather than walking. \\n\\nLegolas watched them for a while with a smile upon his lips, and then \\nhe turned to the others. \\'The strongest must seek a way, say you? But I say: \\nlet a ploughman plough, but choose an otter for swimming, and for running \\nlight over grass and leaf or over snow-an Elf.\\' \\n\\nWith that he sprang forth nimbly, and then Frodo noticed as if for the \\nfirst time, though he had long known it, that the Elf had no boots, but wore \\nonly light shoes, as he always did, and his feet made little imprint in the \\nsnow. \\n\\n\\'Farewell!\\' he said to Gandalf. \\'I go to find the Sun!\\' Then swift as a \\nrunner over firm sand he shot away, and quickly overtaking the toiling men, \\nwith a wave of his hand he passed them, and sped into the distance, and \\nvanished round the rocky turn. \\n\\nThe others waited huddled together, watching until Boromir and Aragorn \\ndwindled into black specks in the whiteness. At length they too passed from \\nsight. The time dragged on. The clouds lowered, and now a few flakes of snow \\ncame curling down again. \\n\\nAn hour, maybe, went by, though it seemed far longer, and then at last \\nthey saw Legolas coming back. At the same time Boromir and Aragorn \\nreappeared round the bend far behind him and came labouring up the slope. \\n\\n\\'Well,\\' cried Legolas as he ran up, \\'I have not brought the Sun. She is \\nwalking in the blue fields of the South, and a little wreath of snow on this \\nRedhorn hillock troubles her not at all. But I have brought back a gleam of \\ngood hope for those who are doomed to go on feet. There is the greatest \\nwind-drift of all just beyond the turn, and there our Strong Men were almost \\nburied. They despaired, until I returned and told them that the drift was \\nlittle wider than a wall. And on the other side the snow suddenly grows \\nless, while further down it is no more than a white coverlet to cool a \\nhobbit\\'s toes.\\' \\n\\n\\'Ah, it is as I said,\\' growled Gimli. \\'It was no ordinary storm. It is \\nthe ill will of Caradhras. He does not love Elves and Dwarves, and that \\ndrift was laid to cut off our escape.\\' \\n\\n\\'But happily your Caradhras has forgotten that you have Men with you,\\' \\nsaid Boromir, who came up at that moment. \\'And doughty Men too, if I may \\nsay \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nit; though lesser men with spades might have served you better. Still, we \\nhave thrust a lane through the drift; and for that all here may be grateful \\nwho cannot run as light as Elves.\\' \\n\\n\\'But how are we to get down there, even if you have cut through the \\ndrift?\\' said Pippin, voicing the thought of all the hobbits. \\n\\n\\'Have hope!\\' said Boromir. \\'I am weary, but I still have some strength \\nleft, and Aragorn too. We will bear the little folk. The others no doubt \\nwill make shift to tread the path behind us. Come, Master Peregrin! I will \\nbegin with you.\\' \\n\\nHe lifted up the hobbit. \\'Cling to my back! I shall need my arms\\' he \\nsaid and strode forward. Aragorn with Merry came behind. Pippin marvelled at \\nhis strength, seeing the passage that he had already forced with no other \\ntool than his great limbs. Even now, burdened as he was, he was widening the \\ntrack for those who followed, thrusting the snow aside as he went. \\n\\nThey came at length to the great drift. It was flung across the \\nmountain-path like a sheer and sudden wall, and its crest, sharp as if \\nshaped with knives, reared up more than twice the height of Boromir; but \\nthrough the middle a passage had been beaten, rising and falling like a \\nbridge. On the far side Merry and Pippin were set down, and there they \\nwaited with Legolas for the rest of the Company to arrive. \\n\\nAfter a while Boromir returned carrying Sam. Behind in the narrow but \\nnow well-trodden track came Gandalf, leading Bill with Gimli perched among \\nthe baggage. Last came Aragorn carrying Frodo. They passed through the lane; \\nbut hardly had Frodo touched the ground when with a deep rumble there rolled \\ndown a fall of stones and slithering snow. The spray of it half blinded the \\nCompany as they crouched against the cliff, and when the air cleared again \\nthey saw that the path was blocked behind them. \\n\\n\\'Enough, enough!\\' cried Gimli. \\'We are departing as quickly as we may!\\' \\nAnd indeed with that last stroke the malice of the mountain seemed to be \\nexpended, as if Caradhras was satisfied that the invaders had been beaten \\noff and would not dare to return. The threat of snow lifted; the clouds \\nbegan to break and the light grew broader. \\n\\nAs Legolas had reported, they found that the snow became steadily more \\nshallow as they went down, so that even the hobbits could trudge along. Soon \\nthey all stood once more on the flat shelf at the head of the steep slope \\nwhere they had felt the first flakes of snow the night before. \\n\\nThe morning was now far advanced. From the high place they looked back \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwestwards over the lower lands. Far away in the tumble of country that lay \\nat the foot of the mountain was the dell from which they had started to \\nclimb the pass. \\n\\nFrodo\\'s legs ached. He was chilled to the bone and hungry; and his head \\nwas dizzy as he thought of the long and painful march downhill. Black specks \\nswam before his eyes. He rubbed them, but the black specks remained. In the \\ndistance below him, but still high above the lower foothills, dark dots were \\ncircling in the air. \\n\\n\\'The birds again!\\' said Aragorn, pointing down. \\n\\nThat cannot be helped now,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Whether they are good or \\nevil, or have nothing to do with us at all, we must go down at once. Not \\neven on the knees of Caradhras will we wait for another night-fall!\\' \\n\\nA cold wind flowed down behind them, as they turned their backs on the \\nRedhorn Gate, and stumbled wearily down the slope. Caradhras had defeated \\nthem. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 4 . A Journey in the Dark \\n\\n\\n\\nIt was evening, and the grey light was again waning fast, when they \\nhalted for the night. They were very weary. The mountains were veiled in \\ndeepening dusk, and the wind was cold. Gandalf spared them one more \\nmouthful \\n\\neach of the miruvor of Rivendell. When they had eaten some food he called a \\ncouncil. \\n\\n\\'We cannot, of course, go on again tonight,\\' he said. \\'The attack on \\nthe Redhorn Gate has tired us out, and we must rest here for a while.\\' \\n\\n\\'And then where are we to go? \\' asked Frodo. \\n\\n\\'We still have our journey and our errand before us,\\' answered Gandalf. \\n\\n\\'We have no choice but to go on, or to return to Rivendell.\\' \\n\\nPippin\\'s face brightened visibly at the mere mention of return to \\nRivendell; Merry and Sam looked up hopefully. But Aragorn and Boromir \\nmade \\n\\nno sign. Frodo looked troubled. \\n\\n\\'I wish I was back there,\\' he said. \\'But how can I return without shame \\n-- unless there is indeed no other way, and we are already defeated? \\' \\n\\n\\'You are right, Frodo,\\' said Gandalf: \\'to go back is to admit defeat \\nand face worse defeat to come. If we go back now, then the Ring must remain \\nthere: we shall not be able to set out again. Then sooner or later Rivendell \\nwill be besieged, and after a brief and bitter time it will be destroyed. \\n\\nThe Ringwraiths are deadly enemies, but they are only shadows yet of the \\npower and terror they would possess if the Ruling Ring was on their master\\'s \\nhand again.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then we must go on, if there is a way,\\' said Frodo with a sigh. Sam \\nsank back into gloom. \\n\\n\\'There is a way that we may attempt,\\' said Gandalf. I thought from the \\nbeginning, when first I considered this journey, that we should try it. But \\nit is not a pleasant way, and I have not spoken of it to the Company before. \\nAragorn was against it, until the pass over the mountains had at least been \\ntried.\\' \\n\\n\\'If it is a worse road than the Redhorn Gate, then it must be evil \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nindeed,\\' said Merry. \\'But you had better tell us about it, and let us know \\nthe worst at once.\\' \\n\\n\\'The road that I speak of leads to the Mines of Moria,\\' said Gandalf. \\n\\nOnly Gimli lifted up his head; a smouldering fire was in his eyes. On all \\nthe others a dread fell at the mention of that name. Even to the hobbits it \\nwas a legend of vague fear: \\n\\n\\'The road may lead to Moria, but how can we hope that it will lead \\nthrough Moria? \\' said Aragorn darkly. \\n\\n\\'It is a name of ill omen,\\' said Boromir. \\'Nor do I see the need to go \\nthere. If we cannot cross the mountains, let us journey southwards, until we \\ncome to the Gap of Rohan, where men are friendly to my people, taking the \\nroad that I followed on my way hither. Or we might pass by and cross the \\nIsen into Langstrand and Lebennin, and so come to Gondor from the regions \\nnigh to the sea.\\' \\n\\n\\'Things have changed since you came north, Boromir,\\' answered Gandalf. \\n\\'Did you not hear what I told you of Saruman? With him I may have business \\nof my own ere all is over. But the Ring must not come near Isengard, if that \\ncan by any means be prevented. The Gap of Rohan is closed to us while we go \\nwith the Bearer. \\n\\n\\'As for the longer road: we cannot afford the time. We might spend a \\nyear in such a journey, and we should pass through many lands that are empty \\nand harbourless. Yet they would not be safe. The watchful eyes both of \\nSaruman and of the Enemy are on them. When you came north, Boromir, you \\nwere \\n\\nin the Enemy\\'s eyes only one stray wanderer from the South and a matter of \\nsmall concern to him: his mind was busy with the pursuit of the Ring. But \\nyou return now as a member of the Ring\\'s Company, and you are in peril as \\nlong as you remain with us. The danger will increase with every league that \\nwe go south under the naked sky. \\n\\n\\'Since our open attempt on the mountain -pass our plight has become more \\ndesperate, I fear. I see now little hope, if we do not soon vanish from \\nsight for a while, and cover our trail. Therefore I advise that we should go \\nneither over the mountains, nor round them, but under them. That is a road \\nat any rate that the Enemy will least expect us to take.\\' \\n\\n\\'We do not know what he expects,\\' said Boromir. \\'lie may watch all \\nroads, likely and unlikely. In that case to enter Moria would be to walk \\ninto a trap, hardly better than knocking at the gates of the Dark Tower \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nitself. The name of Moria is black.\\' \\n\\n\\'You speak of what you do not know, when you liken Moria to the \\nstronghold of Sauron,\\' answered Gandalf. \\'I alone of you have ever been in \\nthe dungeons of the Dark Lord, and only in his older and lesser dwelling in \\nDol Guldur. Those who pass the gates of Barad-dyr do not return. But I would \\nnot lead you into Moria if there were no hope of coming out again. If there \\nare Ores there, it may prove ill for us, that is true. But most of the Ores \\nof the Misty Mountains were scattered or destroyed in the Battle of Five \\nArmies. The Eagles report that Ores are gathering again from afar; but there \\nis a hope that Moria is still free. \\n\\n\\'There is even a chance that Dwarves are there, and that in some deep \\nhall of his fathers, Balin son of Fundin may be found. However it may prove, \\none must tread the path that need chooses!\\' \\n\\n\\'I will tread the path with you, Gandalf! \\' said Gimli. \\'I will go and \\nlook on the halls of Durin, whatever may wait there-if you can find the \\ndoors that are shut.\\' \\n\\n\\'Good, Gimli! \\' said Gandalf. \\'You encourage me. We will seek the \\nhidden doors together. And we will come through. In the ruins of the \\nDwarves, a dwarfs head will be less easy to bewilder than Elves or Men or \\nHobbits. Yet it will not be the first time that I have been to Moria. I \\nsought there long for Thrbin son of Thrur after he was lost. I passed \\nthrough, and I came out again alive! \\' \\n\\n\\'I too once passed the Dimrill Gate,\\' said Aragorn quietly; \\'but though \\nI also came out again, the memory is very evil. I do not wish to enter Moria \\na second time.\\' \\n\\n\\'And I don\\'t wish to enter it even once,\\' said Pippin. \\n\\n\\'Nor me,\\' muttered Sam. \\n\\n\\'Of course not! \\' said Gandalf. \\'Who would? But the question is: who \\nwill follow me, if I lead you there? \\' \\n\\n\\'I will,\\' said Gimli eagerly. \\n\\n\\'I will,\\' said Aragorn heavily. \\'You followed my lead almost to \\ndisaster in the snow, and have said no word of blame. I will follow your \\nlead now -- if this last warning does not move you. It is not of the Ring, \\nnor of us others that I am thinking now, but of you, Gandalf. And I say to \\nyou: if you pass the doors of Moria, beware! \\' \\n\\n\\'I will not go,\\' said Boromir; \\'not unless the vote of the whole \\ncompany is against me. What do Legolas and the little folk say? The \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRing-bearer\\'s voice surely should be heard? \\' \\n\\nI do not wish to go to Moria,\\' said Legolas. \\n\\nThe hobbits said nothing. Sam looked at Frodo. At last Frodo spoke. \\'I \\ndo not wish to go,\\' he said; \\'but neither do I wish to refuse the advice of \\nGandalf. I beg that there should be no vote, until we have slept on it. \\nGandalf will get votes easier in the light of the morning than in this cold \\ngloom. How the wind howls ! \\' \\n\\nAt these words all fell into silent thought. They heard the wind \\nhissing among the rocks and trees, and there was a howling and wailing round \\nthem in the empty spaces of the night. \\n\\nSuddenly Aragorn leapt to his feet. \\'How the wind howls ! \\' he cried. \\n\\n\\'It is howling with wolf-voices. The Wargs have come west of the Mountains! \\n\\nf \\n\\n\\'Need we wait until morning then? \\' said Gandalf. \\'It is as I said. The \\nhunt is up! Even if we live to see the dawn, who now will wish to journey \\nsouth by night with the wild wolves on his trail? \\' \\n\\n\\'How far is Moria? \\' asked Boromir. \\n\\n\\'There was a door south-west of Caradhras, some fifteen miles as the \\ncrow flies, and maybe twenty as the wolf runs,\\' answered Gandalf grimly. \\n\\n\\'Then let us start as soon as it is light tomorrow, if we can,\\' said \\nBoromir. \\'The wolf that one hears is worse than the ore that one fears.\\' \\n\\n\\'True!\\' said Aragorn, loosening his sword in its sheath. \\'But where the \\nwarg howls, there also the ore prowls.\\' \\n\\n\\'I wish I had taken Elrond\\'s advice,\\' muttered Pippin to Sam. I am no \\ngood after all. There is not enough of the breed of Bandobras the Bullroarer \\nin me: these howls freeze my blood. I don\\'t ever remember feeling so \\nwretched.\\' \\n\\n\\'My heart\\'s right down in my toes, Mr. Pippin,\\' said Sam. \\'But we \\naren\\'t etten yet, and there are some stout folk here with us. Whatever may \\nbe in store for old Gandalf, I\\'ll wager it isn\\'t a wolfs belly.\\' \\n\\nFor their defence in the night the Company climbed to the top of the \\nsmall hill under which they had been sheltering, it was crowned with a knot \\nof old and twisted trees, about which lay a broken circle of boulder stones. \\n\\nIn the midst of this they lit a fire, for there was no hope that darkness \\nand silence would keep their trail from discovery by the hunting packs. \\n\\nRound the fire they sat, and those that were not on guard dozed \\nuneasily. Poor Bill the pony trembled and sweated where he stood. The \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhowling of the wolves was now all round them, sometimes nearer and \\nsometimes \\n\\nfurther off. In the dead of the night many shining eyes were seen peering \\nover the brow of the hill. Some advanced almost to the ring of stones. At a \\ngap in the circle a great dark wolf-shape could be seen halted, gazing at \\nthem. A shuddering howl broke from him, as if he were a captain summoning \\nhis pack to the assault. \\n\\nGandalf stood up and strode forward, holding his staff aloft. \\'Listen, \\n\\nHound of Sauron! \\' he cried. \\'Gandalf is here. Fly, if you value your foul \\nskin! I will shrivel you from tail to snout, if you come within this ring.\\' \\n\\nThe wolf snarled and sprang towards them with a great leap. At that \\nmoment there was a sharp twang. Legolas had loosed his bow. There was a \\nhideous yell, and the leaping shape thudded to the ground; the elvish arrow \\nhad pierced its throat. The watching eyes were suddenly extinguished. \\nGandalf and Aragorn strode forward, but the hill was deserted; the hunting \\npacks had fled. All about them the darkness grew silent, and no cry came on \\nthe sighing wind. \\n\\nThe night was old, and westward the waning moon was setting, gleaming \\nfitfully through the breaking clouds. Suddenly Frodo started from sleep. \\nWithout warning a storm of howls broke out fierce and wild all about the \\ncamp. A great host of Wargs had gathered silently and was now attacking them \\nfrom every side at once. \\n\\n\\'Fling fuel on the fire!\\' cried Gandalf to the hobbits. \\'Draw your \\nblades, and stand back to back!\\' \\n\\nIn the leaping light, as the fresh wood blazed up, Frodo saw many grey \\nshapes spring over the ring of stones. More and more followed. Through the \\nthroat of one huge leader Aragorn passed his sword with a thrust; with a \\ngreat sweep Boromir hewed the head off another. Beside them Gimli stood \\nwith \\n\\nhis stout legs apart, wielding his dwarf-axe. The bow of Legolas was \\nsinging. \\n\\nIn the wavering firelight Gandalf seemed suddenly to grow: he rose up, \\na great menacing shape like the monument of some ancient king of stone set \\nupon a hill. Stooping like a cloud, he lifted a burning branch and strode to \\nmeet the wolves. They gave back before him. High in the air he tossed the \\nblazing brand. It flared with a sudden white radiance like lightning; and \\nhis voice rolled like thunder. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\' Naur an edraith ammen! Naur dan i ngaurhoth!\\' he cried. \\n\\nThere was a roar and a crackle, and the tree above him burst into a \\nleaf and bloom of blinding flame. The fire leapt from tree-top to tree -top. \\n\\nThe whole hill was crowned with dazzling light. The swords and knives of the \\ndefenders shone and flickered. The last arrow of Legolas kindled in the air \\nas it flew, and plunged burning into the heart of a great wolf-chieftain. \\n\\nAll the others fled. \\n\\nSlowly the fire died till nothing was left but falling ash and sparks; \\na bitter smoke curled above the burned tree-stumps, and blew darkly from the \\nhill, as the first light of dawn came dimly in the sky. Their enemies were \\nrouted and did not return. \\n\\n\\'What did I tell you, Mr. Pippin? \\' said Sam, she/thing his sword. \\n\\n\\'Wolves won\\'t get him. That was an eye-opener, and no mistake! Nearly singed \\nthe hair off my head!\\' \\n\\nWhen the full light of the morning came no signs of the wolves were to \\nbe found, and they looked in vain for the bodies of the dead. No trace of \\nthe fight remained but the charred trees and the arrows of Legolas lying on \\nthe hill-top. All were undamaged save one of which only the point was left. \\n\\n\\'It is as I feared,\\' said Gandalf. \\'These were no ordinary wolves \\nhunting for food in the wilderness. Let us eat quickly and go!\\' \\n\\nThat day the weather changed again, almost as if it was at the command \\nof some power that had no longer any use for snow, since they had retreated \\nfrom the pass, a power that wished now to have a clear light in which things \\nthat moved in the wild could be seen from far away. The wind had been \\nturning through north to north-west during the night, and now it failed. The \\nclouds vanished southwards and the sky was opened, high and blue. As they \\nstood upon the hill-side, ready to depart, a pale sunlight gleamed over the \\nmountain-tops. \\n\\n\\'We must reach the doors before sunset,\\' said Gandalf, \\'or I fear we \\nshall not reach them at all. It is not far, but our path may be winding, for \\nhere Aragorn cannot guide us; he has seldom walked in this country, and only \\nonce have I been under the west wall of Moria, and that was long ago. \\n\\n\\'There it lies,\\' he said, pointing away south-eastwards to where the \\nmountains\\' sides fell sheer into the shadows at their feet. In the distance \\ncould be dimly seen a line of bare cliffs, and in their midst, taller than \\nthe rest, one great grey wall. \\'When we left the pass I led you southwards, \\nand not back to our starting point, as some of you may have noticed. It is \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwell that I did so, for now we have several miles less to cross, and haste \\nis needed. Let us go! \\' \\n\\n\\'I do not know which to hope,\\' said Boromir grimly: \\'that Gandalf will \\nfind what he seeks, or that coming to the cliff we shall find the gates lost \\nfor ever. All choices seem ill, and to be caught between wolves and the wall \\nthe likeliest chance. Lead on!\\' \\n\\nGimli now walked ahead by the wizard\\'s side, so eager was he to come to \\nMoria. Together they led the Company back towards the mountains. The only \\nroad of old to Moria from the west had lain along the course of a stream, \\nthe Sirannon, that ran out from the feet of the cliffs near where the doors \\nhad stood. But either Gandalf was astray, or else the land had changed in \\nrecent years; for he did not strike the stream where he looked to find it, \\nonly a few miles southwards from their start. \\n\\nThe morning was passing towards noon, and still the Company wandered \\nand scrambled in a barren country of red stones. Nowhere could they see any \\ngleam of water or hear any sound of it. All was bleak and dry. Their hearts \\nsank. They saw no living thing, and not a bird was in the sky; but what the \\nnight would bring, if it caught them in that lost land, none of them cared \\nto think. \\n\\nSuddenly Gimli, who had pressed on ahead, called back to them. He was \\nstanding on a knoll and pointing to the right. Hurrying up they saw below \\nthem a deep and narrow channel. It was empty and silent, and hardly a \\ntrickle of water flowed among the brown and red-stained stones of its bed; \\nbut on the near side there was a path, much broken and decayed, that wound \\nits way among the ruined walls and paving-stones of an ancient highroad. \\n\\n\\'Ah! Here it is at last! \\' said Gandalf. \\'This is where the stream ran: \\n\\nSirannon, the Gate-stream, they used to call it. But what has happened to \\nthe water, I cannot guess; it used to be swift and noisy. Come! We must \\nhurry on. We are late.\\' \\n\\nThe Company were footsore and tired; but they trudged doggedly along \\nthe rough and winding track for many miles. The sun turned from the noon and \\nbegan to go west. After a brief halt and a hasty meal they went on again. \\nBefore them the mountains frowned, but their path lay in a deep trough of \\nland and they could see only the higher shoulders and the far eastward \\npeaks. \\n\\nAt length they came to a sharp bend. There the road, which had been \\nveering southwards between the brink of the channel and a steep fall of the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nland to the left, turned and went due east again. Rounding the corner they \\nsaw before them a low cliff, some five fathoms high, with a broken and \\njagged top. Over it a trickling water dripped, through a wide cleft that \\nseemed to have been carved out by a fall that had once been strong and full. \\n\\n\\'Indeed things have changed! \\' said Gandalf. \\'But there is no mistaking \\nthe place. There is all that remains of the Stair Falls. If I remember \\nright, there was a flight of steps cut in the rock at their side, but the \\nmain road wound away left and climbed with several loops up to the level \\nground at the top. There used to be a shallow valley beyond the falls right \\nup to the Walls of Moria, and the Sirannon flowed through it with the road \\nbeside it. Let us go and see what things are like now ! \\' \\n\\nThey found the stone steps without difficulty, and Gimli sprang swiftly \\nup them, followed by Gandalf and Frodo. When they reached the top they saw \\nthat they could go no further that way, and the reason for the drying up of \\nthe Gate-stream was revealed. Behind them the sinking Sun filled the cool \\nwestern sky with glimmering gold. Before them stretched a dark still lake. \\nNeither sky nor sunset was reflected on its sullen surface. The Sirannon had \\nbeen dammed and had filled all the valley. Beyond the ominous water were \\nreared vast cliffs, their stern faces pallid in the fading light: final and \\nimpassable. No sign of gate or entrance, not a fissure or crack could Frodo \\nsee in the frowning stone. \\n\\n\\'There are the Walls of Moria,\\' said Gandalf, pointing across the \\nwater. \\'And there the Gate stood once upon a time, the Elven Door at the end \\nof the road from Flollin by which we have come. But this way is blocked. None \\nof the Company, I guess, will wish to swim this gloomy water at the end of \\nthe day. It has an unwholesome look.\\' \\n\\n\\'We must find a way round the northern edge,\\' said Gimli. \\'The first \\nthing for the Company to do is to climb up by the main path and see where \\nthat will lead us. Even if there were no lake, we could not get our \\nbaggage-pony up this stair.\\' \\n\\n\\'But in any case we cannot take the poor beast into the Mines,\\' said \\nGandalf. \\'The road under the mountains is a dark road, and there are places \\nnarrow and steep which he cannot tread, even if we can.\\' \\n\\n\\'Poor old Bill! \\' said Frodo. \\'I had not thought of that. And poor Sam! \\n\\nI wonder what he will say? \\' \\n\\n\\'I am sorry,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Poor Bill has been a useful companion and \\nit goes to my heart to turn him adrift now. I would have travelled lighter \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand brought no animal, least of all this one that Sam is fond of, if I had \\nhad my way. I feared all along that we should be obliged to take this road.\\' \\n\\nThe day was drawing to its end, and cold stars were glinting in the sky \\nhigh above the sunset, when the Company, with all the speed they could, \\nclimbed up the slopes and reached the side of the lake. In breadth it looked \\nto be no more than two or three furlongs at the widest point. How far it \\nstretched away southward they could not see in the failing light; but its \\nnorthern end was no more than half a mile from where they stood, and between \\nthe stony ridges that enclosed the valley and the water\\'s edge there was a \\nrim of open ground. They hurried forward, for they had still a mile or two \\nto go before they could reach the point on the far shore that Gandalf was \\nmaking for; and then he had still to find the doors. \\n\\nWhen they came to the northernmost corner of the lake they found a \\nnarrow creek that barred their way. It was green and stagnant, thrust out \\nlike a slimy arm towards the enclosing hills. Gimli strode forward \\nundeterred, and found that the water was shallow, no more than ankle-deep at \\nthe edge. Behind him they walked in file, threading their way with care, for \\nunder the weedy pools were sliding and greasy stones, and footing was \\ntreacherous. Frodo shuddered with disgust at the touch of the dark unclean \\nwater on his feet. \\n\\nAs Sam, the last of the Company, led Bill up on to the dry ground on \\nthe far side, there came a soft sound: a swish, followed by a plop, as if a \\nfish had disturbed the still surface of the water. Turning quickly they saw \\nripples, black-edged with shadow in the waning light: great rings were \\nwidening outwards from a point far out in the lake. There was a bubbling \\nnoise, and then silence. The dusk deepened, and the last gleams of the \\nsunset were veiled in cloud. \\n\\nGandalf now pressed on at a great pace, and the others followed as \\nquickly as they could. They reached the strip of dry land between the lake \\nand the cliffs: it was narrow, often hardly a dozen yards across, and \\nencumbered with fallen rock and stones; but they found a way, hugging the \\ncliff, and keeping as far from the dark water as they might. A mile \\nsouthwards along the shore they came upon holly trees. Stumps and dead \\nboughs were rotting in the shallows, the remains it seemed of old thickets, \\nor of a hedge that had once lined the road across the drowned valley. But \\nclose under the cliff there stood, still strong and living, . two tall \\ntrees, larger than any trees of holly that Frodo had ever seen or imagined. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTheir great roots spread from the wall to the water. Under the looming \\ncliffs they had looked like mere bushes, when seen far off from the top of \\nthe Stair; but now they towered overhead, stiff, dark, and silent, throwing \\ndeep night-shadows about their feet, standing like sentinel pillars at the \\nend of the road. \\n\\n\\'Well, here we are at last! \\'said Gandalf. \\'Here the Elven-way from \\nHollin ended. Holly was the token of the people of that land, and they \\nplanted it here to mark the end of their domain; for the West -door was made \\nchiefly for their use in their traffic with the Lords of Moria. Those were \\nhappier days, when there was still close friendship at times between folk of \\ndifferent race, even between Dwarves and Elves.\\' \\n\\n\\'It was not the fault of the Dwarves that the friendship waned,\\' said \\nGimli. \\n\\n\\'I have not heard that it was the fault of the Elves,\\' said Legolas. \\n\\n\\'I have heard both,\\' said Gandalf; \\'and I will not give judgement now. \\n\\nBut I beg you two, Legolas and Gimli, at least to be friends, and to help \\nme. I need you both. The doors are shut and hidden, and the sooner we find \\nthem the better. Night is at hand! \\' \\n\\nTurning to the others he said: \\'While I am searching, will you each \\nmake ready to enter the Mines? For here I fear we must say farewell to our \\ngood beast of burden. You must lay aside much of the stuff that we brought \\nagainst bitter weather: you will not need it inside, nor, I hope, when we \\ncome through and journey on down into the South. Instead each of us must \\ntake a share of what the pony carried, especially the food and the \\nwater-skins.\\' \\n\\n\\'But you can\\'t leave poor old Bill behind in this forsaken place, Mr. \\nGandalf! \\' cried Sam, angry and distressed. \\'I won\\'t have it, and that\\'s \\nflat. After he has come so far and all ! \\' \\n\\n\\'I am sorry, Sam,\\' said the wizard. \\'But when the Door opens I do not \\nthink you will be able to drag your Bill inside, into the long dark of \\nMoria. You will have to choose between Bill and your master.\\' \\n\\n\\'He\\'d follow Mr. Frodo into a dragon\\'s den, if I led him,\\' protested \\nSam. \\'It\\'d be nothing short of murder to turn him loose with all these \\nwolves about.\\' \\n\\n\\'It will be short of murder, I hope,\\' said Gandalf. He laid his hand on \\nthe pony\\'s head, and spoke in a low voice. \\'Go with words of guard and \\nguiding on you,\\' he said. \\'You are a wise beast, and have learned much in \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRivendell. Make your ways to places where you can find grass, and so come in \\ntime to Elrond\\'s house, or wherever you wish to go. \\n\\n\\'There, Sam! He will have quite as much chance of escaping wolves and \\ngetting home as we have.\\' \\n\\nSam stood sullenly by the pony and returned no answer. Bill, seeming to \\nunderstand well what was going on, nuzzled up to him, putting his nose to \\nSam\\'s ear. Sam burst into tears, and fumbled with the straps, unlading all \\nthe pony\\'s packs and throwing them on the ground. The others sorted out the \\ngoods, making a pile of all that could be left behind, and dividing up the \\nrest. \\n\\nWhen this was done they turned to watch Gandalf. He appeared to have \\ndone nothing. He was standing between the two trees gazing at the blank wall \\nof the cliff, as if he would bore a hole into it with his eyes. Gimli was \\nwandering about, tapping the stone here and there with his axe. Legolas was \\npressed against the rock, as if listening. \\n\\n\\'Well, here we are and all ready,\\' said Merry; \\'but where are the \\nDoors? I can\\'t see any sign of them.\\' \\n\\n\\'Dwarf-doors are not made to be seen when shut,\\' said Gimli. \\'They are \\ninvisible, and their own masters cannot find them or open them, if their \\nsecret is forgotten.\\' \\n\\n\\'But this Door was not made to be a secret known only to Dwarves,\\' said \\nGandalf, coming suddenly to life and turning round. \\'Unless things are \\naltogether changed, eyes that know what to look for may discover the signs.\\' \\n\\nHe walked forward to the wall. Right between the shadow of the trees \\nthere was a smooth space, and over this he passed his hands to and fro, \\nmuttering words under his breath. Then he stepped back. \\n\\n\\'Look!\\' he said. \\'Can you see anything now?\\' \\n\\nThe Moon now shone upon the grey face of the rock; but they could see \\nnothing else for a while. Then slowly on the surface, where the wizard\\'s \\nhands had passed, faint lines appeared, like slender veins of silver running \\nin the stone. At first they were no more than pale gossamer-threads, so fine \\nthat they only twinkled fitfully where the Moon caught them, but steadily \\nthey grew broader and clearer, until their design could be guessed. \\n\\nAt the top, as high as Gandalf could reach, was an arch of interlacing \\nletters in an Elvish character. Below, though the threads were in places \\nblurred or broken, the outline could be seen of an anvil and a hammer \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsurmounted by a crown with seven stars. Beneath these again were two trees, \\neach bearing crescent moons. More clearly than all else there shone forth in \\nthe middle of the door a single star with many rays. \\n\\n\\'There are the emblems of Dunn!\\' cried Gimli. \\n\\n\\'And there is the Tree of the High Elves!\\' said Legolas. \\n\\n\\'And the Star of the House of Flanor,\\' said Gandalf. \\'They are wrought \\nof ithildin that mirrors only starlight and moonlight, and sleeps until it \\nis touched by one who speaks words now long forgotten in Middle-earth. It is \\nlong since I heard them, and I thought deeply before I could recall them to \\nmy mind.\\' \\n\\n\\'What does the writing say?\\' asked Frodo, who was trying to decipher \\nthe inscription on the arch. \\'I thought I knew the elf-letters but I cannot \\nread these.\\' \\n\\n\\'The words are in the elven-tongue of the West of Middle-earth in the \\nElder Days,\\' answered Gandalf. \\'But they do not say anything of importance \\nto us. They say only: The Doors ofDurin, Lord ofMoria. Speak, friend, and \\nenter. And underneath small and faint is written: I, Narvi, made them. \\nCelebrimbor ofHollin drew these signs.\\' \\n\\n\\'What does it mean by speak, friend, and enter!\\' asked Merry. \\n\\n\\'That is plain enough,\\' said Gimli. \\'If you are a friend, speak the \\npassword, and the doors will open, and you can enter.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Gandalf, \\'these doors are probably governed by words. Some \\ndwarf-gates will open only at special times, or for particular persons; and \\nsome have locks and keys that are still needed when all necessary times and \\nwords are known. These doors have no key. In the days of Durin they were not \\nsecret. They usually stood open and doorwards sat here. But if they were \\nshut, any who knew the opening word could speak it and pass in. At least so \\nit is recorded, is it not, Gimli? \\' \\n\\n\\'It is,\\' said the dwarf. \\'But what the word was is not remembered. \\n\\nNarvi and his craft and all his kindred have vanished from the earth.\\' \\n\\n\\'But do not you know the word, Gandalf? \\' asked Boromir in surprise. \\n\\n\\'No! \\' said the wizard. \\n\\nThe others looked dismayed; only Aragorn, who knew Gandalf well, \\nremained silent and unmoved. \\n\\n\\'Then what was the use of bringing us to this accursed spot?\\' cried \\nBoromir, glancing back with a shudder at the dark water. \\'You told us that \\nyou had once passed through the Mines. How could that be, if you did not \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nknow how to enter? \\' \\n\\n\\'The answer to your first question, Boromir,\\' said the wizard, \\'is that \\nI do not know the word-yet. But we shall soon see. And,\\' he added, with a \\nglint in his eyes under their bristling brows, \\'you may ask what is the use \\nof my deeds when they are proved useless. As for your other question: do you \\ndoubt my tale? Or have you no wits left? I did not enter this way. I came \\nfrom the East. \\n\\n\\'If you wish to know, I will tell you that these doors open outwards. \\n\\nFrom the inside you may thrust them open with your hands. From the outside \\nnothing will move them save the spell of command. They cannot be forced \\ninwards.\\' \\n\\n\\'What are you going to do then? \\' asked Pippin, undaunted by the \\nwizard\\'s bristling brows. \\n\\n\\'Knock on the doors with your head, Peregrin Took,\\' said Gandalf. \\'But \\nif that does not shatter them, and I am allowed a little peace from foolish \\nquestions, I will seek for the opening words. \\n\\n\\'I once knew every spell in all the tongues of Elves or Men or Ores \\nthat was ever used for such a purpose. I can still remember ten score of \\nthem without searching in my mind. But only a few trials, I think, will be \\nneeded; and I shall not have to call on Gimli for words of the secret \\ndwarf-tongue that they teach to none. The opening words were Elvish, like \\nthe writing on the arch: that seems certain.\\' \\n\\nEle stepped up to the rock again, and lightly touched with his staff the \\nsilver star in the middle beneath the sign of the anvil. \\n\\nAnnon edhellen, edro hi ammen! \\n\\nFennas nogothrim, lasto beth lammen! \\n\\nhe said in a commanding voice. The silver lines faded, but the blank \\ngrey stone did not stir. \\n\\nMany times he repeated these words in different order, or varied them. \\nThen he tried other spells, one after another, speaking now faster and \\nlouder, now soft and slow. Then he spoke many single words of Elvish speech. \\nNothing happened. The cliff towered into the night, the countless stars were \\nkindled, the wind blew cold, and the doors stood fast. \\n\\nAgain Gandalf approached the wall, and lifting up his arms he spoke in \\ntones of command and rising wrath. Edro, edro! he cried, and struck the rock \\nwith his staff. Open, open! he shouted, and followed it with the same \\ncommand in every language that had ever been spoken in the West of \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMiddle-earth. Then he threw his staff on the ground, and sat down in \\nsilence. \\n\\nAt that moment from far off the wind bore to their listening ears the \\nhowling of wolves. Bill the pony started in fear, and Sam sprang to his side \\nand whispered softly to him. \\n\\n\\'Do not let him run away! \\' said Boromir. \\'It seems that we shall need \\nhim still, if the wolves do not find us. How I hate this foul pool! \\' He \\nstooped and picking up a large stone he cast it far into the dark water. \\n\\nThe stone vanished with a soft slap; but at the same instant there was \\na swish and a bubble. Great rippling rings formed on the surface out beyond \\nwhere the stone had fallen, and they moved slowly towards the foot of the \\ncliff. \\n\\n\\'Why did you do that, Boromir? \\' said Frodo. V I hate this place, too, \\nand I am afraid. I don\\'t know of what: not of wolves, or the dark behind the \\ndoors, but of something else. I am afraid of the pool. Don\\'t disturb it! \\' \\n\\n\\'1 wish we could get away! \\' said Merry. \\n\\n\\'Why doesn\\'t Gandalf do something quick? \\' said Pippin. \\n\\nGandalf took no notice of them. He sat with his head bowed, either in \\ndespair or in anxious thought. The mournful howling of the wolves was heard \\nagain. The ripples on the water grew and came closer; some were already \\nlapping on the shore. \\n\\nWith a suddenness that startled them all the wizard sprang to his feet. \\n\\nHe was laughing! V I have it! \\' he cried. \\'Of course, of course! Absurdly \\nsimple, like most riddles when you see the answer.\\' \\n\\nPicking up his staff he stood before the rock and said in a clear \\nvoice: Mellon! \\n\\nThe star shone out briefly and faded again. Then silently a great \\ndoorway was outlined, though not a crack or joint had been visible before. \\nSlowly it divided in the middle and swung outwards inch by inch, until both \\ndoors lay back against the wall. Through the opening a shadowy stair could \\nbe seen climbing steeply up; but beyond the lower steps the darkness was \\ndeeper than the night. The Company stared in wonder. \\n\\nV I was wrong after all,\\' said Gandalf, \\'and Gimli too. Merry, of all \\npeople, was on the right track. The opening word was inscribed on the \\narchway all the time! The translation should have been: Say \"Friend\" and \\nenter. I had only to speak the Elvish word for friend and the doors opened. \\nQuite simple. Too simple for a learned lore-master in these suspicious days. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThose were happier times. Now let us go!\\' \\n\\nHe strode forward and set his foot on the lowest step. But at that \\nmoment several things happened. Frodo felt something seize him by the ankle, \\nand he fell with a cry. Bill the pony gave a wild neigh of fear, and turned \\ntail and dashed away along the lakeside into the darkness. Sam leaped after \\nhim, and then hearing Frodo\\'s cry he ran back again, weeping and cursing. \\nThe others swung round and saw the waters of the lake seething, as if a host \\nof snakes were swimming up from the southern end. \\n\\nOut from the water a long sinuous tentacle had crawled; it was \\npale-green and luminous and wet. Its fingered end had hold of Frodo\\'s foot \\nand was dragging him into the water. Sam on his knees was now slashing at it \\nwith a knife. \\n\\nThe arm let go of Frodo, and Sam pulled him away, crying out for help. \\nTwenty others arms came rippling out. The dark water boiled, and there was a \\nhideous stench. \\n\\n\\'Into the gateway! Up the stairs! Quick! \\' shouted Gandalf leaping \\nback. Rousing them from the horror that seemed to have rooted all but Sam to \\nthe ground where they stood, he drove them forward. \\n\\nThey were just in time. Sam and Frodo were only a few steps up, and \\nGandalf had just begun to climb, when the groping tentacles writhed across \\nthe narrow shore and fingered the cliff- wall and the doors. One came \\nwriggling over the threshold, glistening in the starlight. Gandalf turned \\nand paused. If he was considering what word would close the gate again from \\nwithin, there was no need. Many coiling arms seized the doors on either \\nside, and with horrible strength, swung them round. With a shattering echo \\nthey slammed, and all light was lost. A noise of rending and crashing came \\ndully through the ponderous stone. \\n\\nSam, clinging to Frodo\\'s arm, collapsed on a step in the black \\ndarkness. \\'Poor old Bill! \\' he said in a choking voice. \\'Poor old Bill! \\nWolves and snakes! But the snakes were too much for him. I had to choose, \\nMr. Frodo. I had to come with you.\\' \\n\\nThey heard Gandalf go back down the steps and thrust his staff against \\nthe doors. There was a quiver in the stone and the stairs trembled, .but the \\ndoors did not open. \\'Well, well! \\' said the wizard. \\'The passage is blocked \\nbehind us now and there is only one way out-- on the other side of the \\nmountains. I fear from the sounds that boulders have been piled up, and the \\ntrees uprooted and thrown across the gate. I am sorry; for the trees were \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbeautiful, and had stood so long.\\' \\n\\n\\'I felt that something horrible was near from the moment that my foot \\nfirst touched the water,\\' said Frodo. \\'What was the thing, or were there \\nmany of them? \\' \\n\\n\\'I do not know,\\' answered Gandalf, \\'but the arms were all guided by one \\npurpose. Something has crept, or has been driven out of dark waters under \\nthe mountains. There are older and fouler things than Ores in the deep \\nplaces of the world.\\' He did not speak aloud his thought that whatever it \\nwas that dwelt in the lake, it had seized on Frodo first among all the \\nCompany. \\n\\nBoromir muttered under his breath, but the echoing stone magnified the \\nsound to a hoarse whisper that all could hear: \\'In the deep places of the \\nworld! And thither we are going against my wish. Who will lead us nowin \\nthis deadly dark? \\' \\n\\n\\'I will,\\' said Gandalf, \\'and Gimli shall walk with me. Follow my staff! \\n\\nt \\n\\nAs the wizard passed on ahead up the great steps, he held his staff \\naloft, and from its tip there came a faint radiance. The wide stairway was \\nsound and undamaged. Two hundred steps they counted, broad and shallow; \\nand \\n\\nat the top they found an arched passage with a level floor leading on into \\nthe dark. \\n\\n\\'Let us sit and rest and have something to eat, here on the landing, \\nsince we can\\'t find a dining-room! \\' said Frodo. He had begun to shake off \\nthe terror of the clutching arm, and suddenly he felt extremely hungry. \\n\\nThe proposal was welcomed by all; and they sat down on the upper steps, \\ndim figures in the gloom. After they had eaten, Gandalf gave them each a \\nthird sip of the miruvor of Rivendell. \\n\\n\\'It will not last much longer, I am afraid,\\' he said; \\'but I think we \\nneed it after that horror at the gate. And unless we have great luck, we \\nshall need all that is left before we see the other side! Go carefully with \\nthe water, too! There are many streams and wells in the Mines, but they \\nshould not be touched. We may not have a chance of filling our skins and \\nbottles till we come down into Dimrill Dale.\\' \\n\\n\\'How long is that going to take us? \\' asked Frodo. \\n\\n\\'I cannot say,\\' answered Gandalf. \\'It depends on many chances. But \\ngoing straight, without mishap or losing our way, we shall take three or \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfour marches, I expect. It cannot be less than forty miles from West -door to \\nEast-gate in a direct line, and the road may wind much.\\' \\n\\nAfter only a brief rest they started on their way again. All were eager \\nto get the journey over as quickly as possible, and were willing, tired as \\nthey were, to go on marching still for several hours. Gandalf walked in \\nfront as before. In his left hand he held up his glimmering staff, the light \\nof which just showed the ground before his feet; in his right he held his \\nsword Glamdring. Behind him came Gimli, his eyes glinting in the dim light \\nas he turned his head from side to side. Behind the dwarf walked Frodo, and \\nhe had drawn the short sword, Sting. No gleam came from the blades of Sting \\nor of Glamdring; and that was some comfort, for being the work of Elvish \\nsmiths in the Elder Days these swords shone with a cold light, if any Ores \\nwere near at hand. Behind Frodo went Sam, and after him Legolas, and the \\nyoung hobbits, and Boromir. In the dark at the rear, grim and silent, walked \\nAragorn. \\n\\nThe passage twisted round a few turns, and then began to descend. It \\nwent steadily down for a long while before it became level once again. The \\nair grew hot and stifling, but it was not foul, and at times they felt \\ncurrents of cooler air upon their faces, issuing from half-guessed openings \\nin the walls. There were many of these. In the pale ray of the wizard\\'s \\nstaff, Frodo caught glimpses of stairs and arches and of other passages and \\ntunnels, sloping up, or running steeply down, or opening blankly dark on \\neither side. It was bewildering beyond hope of remembering. \\n\\nGimli aided Gandalf very little, except by his stout courage. At least \\nhe was not, as were most of the others, troubled by the mere darkness in \\nitself. Often the wizard consulted him at points where the choice of way was \\ndoubtful; but it was always Gandalf who had the final word. The Mines of \\nMoria were vast and intricate beyond the imagination of Gimli, Gluin\\'s son, \\ndwarf of the mountain-race though he was. To Gandalf the far-off memories of \\na journey long before were now of little help, but even in the gloom and \\ndespite all windings of the road he knew whither he wished to go, and he did \\nnot falter, as long as there was a path that led towards his goal. \\n\\n\\'Do not be afraid! \\' said Aragorn. There was a pause longer than usual, \\nand Gandalf and Gimli were whispering together; the others were crowded \\nbehind, waiting anxiously. \\'Do not be afraid! I have been with him on many a \\njourney, if never on one so dark; and there are tales of Rivendell of \\ngreater deeds of his than any that I have seen. He will not go astray-if \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthere is any path to find. He has led us in here against our fears, but he \\nwill lead us out again, at whatever cost to himself. He is surer of finding \\nthe way home in a blind night than the cats of Queen Ber(r)thiel.\\' \\n\\nIt was well for the Company that they had such a guide. They had no \\nfuel nor any means of making torches; in the desperate scramble at the doors \\nmany things had been left behind. But without any light they would soon have \\ncome to grief. There were not only many roads to choose from, there were \\nalso in many places holes and pitfalls, and dark wells beside the path in \\nwhich their passing feet echoed. There were fissures and chasms in the walls \\nand floor, and every now and then a crack would open right before their \\nfeet. The widest was more than seven feet across, and it was long before \\nPippin could summon enough courage to leap over the dreadful gap. The noise \\nof churning water came up from far below, as if some great mill-wheel was \\nturning in the depths. \\n\\n\\'Rope! \\' muttered Sam. \\'I knew I\\'d want it, if I hadn\\'t got it! \\' \\n\\nAs these dangers became more frequent their march became slower. \\nAlready they seemed to have been tramping on, on, endlessly to the \\nmountains\\' roots. They were more than weary, and yet there seemed no comfort \\nin the thought of halting anywhere. Frodo\\'s spirits had risen for a while \\nafter his escape, and after food and a draught of the cordial; but now a \\ndeep uneasiness, growing to dread, crept over him again. Though he had been \\nhealed in Rivendell of the knife-stroke, that grim wound had not been \\nwithout effect. His senses were sharper and more aware of things that could \\nnot be seen. One sign of change that he soon had noticed was that he could \\nsee more in the dark than any of his companions, save perhaps Gandalf. And \\nhe was in any case the bearer of the Ring: it hung upon its chain against \\nhis breast, and at whiles it seemed a heavy weight. He felt the certainty of \\nevil ahead and of evil following; but he said nothing. He gripped tighter on \\nthe hilt of his sword and went on doggedly. \\n\\nThe Company behind him spoke seldom, and then only in hurried whispers. \\nThere was no sound but the sound of their own feet; the dull stump of \\nGimli\\'s dwarf-boots; the heavy tread of Boromir; the light step of Legolas; \\nthe soft, scarce-heard patter of hobbit-feet; and in the rear the slow firm \\nfootfalls of Aragorn with his long stride. When they halted for a moment \\nthey heard nothing at all, unless it were occasionally a faint trickle and \\ndrip of unseen water. Yet Frodo began to hear, or to imagine that he heard, \\nsomething else: like the faint fall of soft bare feet. It was never loud \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nenough, or near enough, for him to feel certain that he heard it; but once \\nit had started it never stopped, while the Company was moving. But it was \\nnot an echo, for when they halted it pattered on for a little all by itself, \\nand then grew still. \\n\\nIt was after nightfall when they had entered the Mines. They had been \\ngoing for several hours with only brief halts, when Gandalf came to his \\nfirst serious check. Before him stood a wide dark arch opening into three \\npassages: all led in the same general direction, eastwards; but the \\nleft-hand passage plunged down, while the right-hand climbed up, and the \\nmiddle way seemed to run on, smooth and level but very narrow. \\n\\n\\'I have no memory of this place at all!\\' said Gandalf, standing \\nuncertainly under the arch. He held up his staff in the hope of finding some \\nmarks or inscription that might help his choice; but nothing of the kind was \\nto be seen. I am too weary to decide,\\' he said, shaking his head. \\'And I \\nexpect that you are all as weary as I am, or wearier. We had better halt \\nhere for what is left of the night. You know what I mean! In here it is ever \\ndark; but outside the late Moon is riding westward and the middle-night has \\npassed.\\' \\n\\n\\'Poor old Bill! \\' said Sam. \\'I wonder where he is. I hope those wolves \\nhaven\\'t got him yet.\\' \\n\\nTo the left of the great arch they found a stone door: it was half \\nclosed, but swung back easily to a gentle thrust. Beyond there seemed to lie \\na wide chamber cut in the rock. \\n\\n\\'Steady! Steady! \\' cried Gandalf as Merry and Pippin pushed forward, \\nglad to find a place where they could rest with at least more feeling of \\nshelter than in the open passage. \\'Steady! You do not know what is inside \\nyet. I will go first.\\' \\n\\nHe went in cautiously, and the others filed behind. \\'There! \\' he said, \\npointing with his staff to the middle of the floor. Before his feet they saw \\na large round hole like the mouth of a well. Broken and rusty chains lay at \\nthe edge and trailed down into the black pit. Fragments of stone lay near. \\n\\n\\'One of you might have fallen in and still be wondering when you were \\ngoing to strike the bottom,\\' said Aragorn to Merry. \\'Let the guide go first \\nwhile you have one.\\' \\n\\n\\'This seems to have been a guardroom, made for the watching of the \\nthree passages,\\' said Gimli. \\'That hole was plainly a well for the guards\\' \\nuse, covered with a stone lid. But the lid is broken, and we must all take \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncare in the dark.\\' \\n\\nPippin felt curiously attracted by the well. While the others were \\nunrolling blankets and making beds against the walls of the chamber, as far \\nas possible from the hole in the floor, he crept to the edge and peered \\nover. A chill air seemed to strike his face, rising from invisible depths. \\nMoved by a sudden impulse he groped for a loose stone, and let it drop. He \\nfelt his heart beat many times before there was any sound. Then far below, \\nas if the stone had fallen into deep water in some cavernous place, there \\ncame a plunk , very distant, but magnified and repeated in the hollow shaft. \\n\\n\\'What\\'s that? \\' cried Gandalf. He was relieved when Pippin confessed \\nwhat he had done; but he was angry, and Pippin could see his eye glinting. \\n\\'Fool of a Took! \\' he growled. \\'This is a serious journey, not a hobbit \\nwalking -party. Throw yourself in next time, and then you will be no further \\nnuisance. Now be quiet! \\' \\n\\nNothing more was heard for several minutes; but then there came out of \\nthe depths faint knocks: tom-tap, tap-tom. They stopped, and when the echoes \\nhad died away, they were repeated: tap-tom, tom-tap, tap-tap, tom. They \\nsounded disquietingly like signals of some sort; but after a while the \\nknocking died away and was not heard again. \\n\\n\\'That was the sound of a hammer, or I have never heard one,\\' said \\nGimli. \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Gandalf, \\'and I do not like it. It may have nothing to do \\nwith Peregrin\\'s foolish stone; but probably something has been disturbed \\nthat would have been better left quiet. Pray, do nothing of the kind again! \\n\\nLet us hope we shall get some rest without further trouble. You, Pippin, can \\ngo on the first watch, as a reward,\\' he growled, as he rolled himself in a \\nblanket. \\n\\nPippin sat miserably by the door in the pitch dark; but he kept on \\nturning round, fearing that some unknown thing would crawl up out of the \\nwell. He wished he could cover the hole, if only with a blanket, but he \\ndared not move or go near it, even though Gandalf seemed to be asleep. \\n\\nActually Gandalf was awake, though lying still and silent. He was deep \\nin thought, trying to recall every memory of his former journey in the \\nMines, and considering anxiously the next course that he should take; a \\nfalse turn now might be disastrous. After an hour he rose up and came over \\nto Pippin. \\n\\n\\'Get into a corner and have a sleep, my lad,\\' he said in a kindly tone. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'You want to sleep, I expect. I cannot get a wink, so I may as well do the \\nwatching.\\' \\n\\n\\'I know what is the matter with me,\\' he muttered, as he sat down by the \\ndoor. \\'I need smoke ! I have not tasted it since the morning before the \\nsnowstorm.\\' \\n\\nThe last thing that Pippin saw, as sleep took him, was a dark glimpse \\nof the old wizard huddled on the floor, shielding a glowing chip in his \\ngnarled hands between his knees. The flicker for a moment showed his sharp \\nnose, and the puff of smoke. \\n\\nIt was Gandalf who roused them all from sleep. He had sat and watched \\nall alone for about six hours, and had let the others rest. \\'And in the \\nwatches I have made up my mind,\\' he said. \\'I do not like the feel of the \\nmiddle way; and I do not like the smell of the left-hand way: there is foul \\nair down there, or I am no guide. I shall take the right-hand passage. It is \\ntime we began to climb up again.\\' \\n\\nFor eight dark hours, not counting two brief halts, they marched on; \\nand they met no danger, and heard nothing, and saw nothing but the faint \\ngleam of the wizard\\'s light, bobbing like a will-o\\'-the-wisp in front of \\nthem. The passage they had chosen wound steadily upwards. As far as they \\ncould judge it went in great mounting curves, and as it rose it grew loftier \\nand wider. There were now no openings to other galleries or tunnels on \\neither side, and the floor was level and sound, without pits or cracks. \\nEvidently they had struck what once had been an important road; and they \\nwent forward quicker than they had done on their first march. \\n\\nIn this way they advanced some fifteen miles, measured in a direct line \\neast, though they must have actually walked twenty miles or more. As the \\nroad climbed upwards\\' Frodo\\'s spirits rose a little; but he still felt \\noppressed, and still at times he heard, or thought he heard, away behind the \\nCompany and beyond the fall and patter of their feet, a following footstep \\nthat was not an echo. \\n\\nThey had marched as far as the hobbits could endure without a rest, and \\nall were thinking of a place where they could sleep, when suddenly the walls \\nto right and left vanished. They seemed to have passed through some arched \\ndoorway into a black and empty space. There was a great draught of warmer \\nair behind them, and before them the darkness was cold on their faces. They \\nhalted and crowded anxiously together. \\n\\nGandalf seemed pleased. \\'I chose the right way,\\' he said. \\'At last we \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nare coming to the habitable parts, and I guess that we are not far now from \\nthe eastern side. But we are high up, a good deal higher than the Dimrill \\nGate, unless I am mistaken. From the feeling of the air we must be in a wide \\nhall. I will now risk a little real light.\\' \\n\\nHe raised his staff, and for a brief instant there was blaze like a \\nflash of lightning. Great shadows sprang up and fled, and for a second they \\nsaw a vast roof far above their heads upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of \\nstone. Before them and on either side stretched a huge empty hall; its black \\nwalls, polished and smooth as glass, flashed and glittered. Three other \\nentrances they saw, dark black arches: one straight before them eastwards, \\nand one on either side. Then the light went out. \\n\\n\\'That is all that I shall venture on for the present,\\' said Gandalf. \\n\\n\\'There used to be great windows on the mountain-side, and shafts leading out \\nto the light in the upper reaches of the Mines. I think we have reached them \\nnow, but it is night outside again, and we cannot tell until morning. If I \\nam right, tomorrow we may actually see the morning peeping in. But in the \\nmeanwhile we had better go no further. Let us rest, if we can. Things have \\ngone well so far, and the greater part of the dark road is over. But we are \\nnot through yet, and it is a long way down to the Gates that open on the \\nworld.\\' \\n\\nThe Company spent that night in the great cavernous hall, huddled close \\ntogether in a corner to escape the draught: there seemed to be a steady \\ninflow of chill air through the eastern archway. All about them as they lay \\nhung the darkness, hollow and immense, and they were oppressed by the \\nloneliness and vastness of the dolven halls and endlessly branching stairs \\nand passages. The wildest imaginings that dark rumour had ever suggested to \\nthe hobbits fell altogether short of the actual dread and wonder of Moria. \\n\\n\\'There must have been a mighty crowd of dwarves here at one time \\' said \\nSam; \\'and every one of them busier than badgers for five hundred years to \\nmake all this, and most in hard rock too! What did they do it all for? They \\ndidn\\'t live in these darksome holes surely? \\' \\n\\n\\'These are not holes,\\' said Gimli. \\'This is the great realm and city of \\nthe Dwarrowdelf. And of old it was not darksome, but full of light and \\nsplendour, as is still remembered in our songs.\\' \\n\\nHe rose and standing in the dark he began to chant in a deep voice, \\nwhile the echoes ran away into the roof. \\n\\nThe world was young, the mountains green, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo stain yet on the Moon was seen, \\n\\nNo words were laid on stream or stone \\nWhen Durin woke and walked alone. \\n\\nHe named the nameless hills and dells; \\nHe drank from yet untasted wells; \\n\\nHe stooped and looked in Mirrormere, \\nAnd saw a crown of stars appear, \\n\\nAs gems upon a silver thread, \\n\\nAbove the shadow of his head. \\n\\nThe world was fair, the mountains tall, \\nIn Elder Days before the fall \\nOf mighty kings in Nargothrond \\nAnd Gondolin, who now beyond \\nThe Western Seas have passed away: \\nThe world was fair in Durin \\'s Day. \\n\\nA king he was on carven throne \\nIn many-pillared halls of stone \\nWith golden roof and silver floor, \\n\\nAnd runes of power upon the door. \\n\\nThe light of sun and star and moon \\nIn shining lamps of crystal hewn \\nUndimmed by cloud or shade of night \\nThere shone for ever fair and bright. \\n\\nThere hammer on the anvil smote, \\n\\nThere chisel clove, and graver wrote; \\nThere forged was blade, and bound was \\nThe delver mined, the mason built. \\nThere beryl, pearl, and opal pale, \\n\\nAnd metal wrought like fishes\\' mail, \\nBuckler and corslet, axe and sword, \\nAnd shining spears were laid in hoard. \\n\\nUnwearied then were Durin \\'s folk \\nBeneath the mountains music woke: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe harpers harped, the minstrels sang, \\nAnd at the gates the trumpets rang. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe world is grey, the mountains old, \\n\\nThe forge\\'s fire is ashen-cold \\nNo harp is wrung, no hammer falls: \\n\\nThe darkness dwells in Durin \\'s halls \\nThe shadow lies upon his tomb \\nIn Moria, in Khazad-dym. \\n\\nBut still the sunken stars appear \\nIn dark and windless Mirrormere; \\n\\nThere lies his crown in water deep, \\n\\nTill Durin wakes again from sleep. \\n\\n\\'I like that! \\' said Sam. V I should like to learn it. In Moria, in \\nKhazad-dym ! But it makes the darkness seem heavier, thinking of all those \\nlamps. Are there piles of jewels and gold lying about here still? \\' \\n\\nGimli was silent. Having sung his song he would say no more. \\n\\n\\'Piles of jewels? \\' said Gandalf. \\'No. The Ores have often plundered \\nMoria; there is nothing left in the upper halls. And since the dwarves fled, \\nno one dares to seek the shafts and treasuries down in the deep places: they \\nare drowned in water-- or in a shadow of fear.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then what do the dwarves want to come back for? \\' asked Sam. \\n\\n\\'For mithrif answered Gandalf. \\'The wealth of Moria was not in gold \\nand jewels, the toys of the Dwarves; nor in iron, their servant. Such things \\nthey found here, it is true, especially iron; but they did not need to delve \\nfor them: all things that they desired they could obtain in traffic. For \\nhere alone in the world was found Moria-silver, or true-silver as some have \\ncalled it: mithril is the Elvish name. The Dwarves have a name which they do \\nnot tell. Its worth was ten times that of gold, and now it is beyond price; \\nfor little is left above ground, and even the Ores dare not delve here for \\nit. The lodes lead away north towards Caradhras, and down to darkness. The \\nDwarves tell no tale; but even as mithril was the foundation of their \\nwealth, so also it was their destruction: they delved too greedily and too \\ndeep, and disturbed that from which they fled, Durin\\'s Bane. Of what they \\nbrought to light the Ores have gathered nearly all, and given it in tribute \\nto Sauron, who covets it. \\n\\n\\' Mithril! All folk desired it. It could be beaten like copper, and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\npolished like glass; and the Dwarves could make of it a metal, light and yet \\nharder than tempered steel. Its beauty was like to that of common silver, \\nbut the beauty of mithril did not tarnish or grow dim. The Elves dearly \\nloved it, and among many uses they made of it ithildin , starmoon, which you \\nsaw upon the doors. Bilbo had a corslet of mithril-rings that Thorin gave \\nhim. I wonder what has become of it? Gathering dust still in Michel Delving \\nMathom-house, I suppose.\\' \\n\\n\\'What? \\' cried Gimli, startled out of his silence. \\'A corslet of \\nMoria- silver? That was a kingly gift! \\' \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Gandalf. I never told him, but its worth was greater than \\nthe value of the whole Shire and everything in it.\\' \\n\\nFrodo said nothing, but he put his hand under his tunic and touched the \\nrings of his mail-shirt. He felt staggered to think that he had been walking \\nabout with the price of the Shire under his jacket. Had Bilbo known? He felt \\nno doubt that Bilbo knew quite well. It was indeed a kingly gift. But now \\nhis thoughts had been carried away from the dark Mines, to Rivendell, to \\nBilbo, and to Bag End in the days while Bilbo was still there. He wished \\nwith all his heart that he was back there, and in those days, mowing the \\nlawn, or pottering among the flowers, and that he had never heard of Moria, \\nor mithril -- or the Ring. \\n\\nA deep silence fell. One by one the others fell asleep. Frodo was on \\nguard. As if it were a breath that came in through unseen doors out of deep \\nplaces, dread came over him. His hands were cold and his brow damp. He \\nlistened. All his mind was given to listening and nothing else for two slow \\nhours; but he heard no sound, not even the imagined echo of a footfall. \\n\\nHis watch was nearly over, when, far off where he guessed that the \\nwestern archway stood, he fancied that he could see two pale points of \\nlight, almost like luminous eyes. He started. His head had nodded. \\'I must \\nhave nearly fallen asleep on guard,\\' he thought. \\'I was on the edge of a \\ndream.\\' He stood up and rubbed his eyes, and remained standing, peering into \\nthe dark, until he was relieved by Legolas. \\n\\nWhen he lay down he quickly went to sleep, but it seemed to him that \\nthe dream went on: he heard whispers, and saw the two pale points of light \\napproaching, slowly. He woke and found that the others were speaking softly \\nnear him, and that a dim light was falling on his face. High up above the \\neastern archway through a shaft near the roof came a long pale gleam; and \\nacross the hall through the northern arch light also glimmered faint and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndistantly. \\n\\nFrodo sat up. \\'Good morning! \\'said Gandalf: \\'For morning it is again \\nat last. I was right, you see. We are high up on the east side of Moria. \\nBefore today is over we ought to find the Great Gates and see the waters of \\nMirrormere lying in the Dimrill Dale before us.\\' \\n\\n\\'I shall be glad,\\' said Gimli. \\'I have looked on Moria, and it is very \\ngreat, but it has become dark and dreadful; and we have found no sign of my \\nkindred. I doubt now that Balin ever came here.\\' \\n\\nAfter they had breakfasted Gandalf decided to go on again at once. \\'We \\nare tired, but we shall rest better when we are outside,\\' he said. \\'I think \\nthat none of us will wish to spend another night in Moria.\\' \\n\\n\\'No indeed! \\' said Boromir. \\'Which way shall we take? Yonder eastward \\narch? \\' \\n\\n\\'Maybe,\\' said Gandalf. \\'But I du not know yet exactly where we are. \\nUnless I am quite astray, I guess that we are above and to the north of the \\nGreat Gates; and it may not be easy to find the right road down to them. The \\neastern arch will probably prove to be the way that we must take; but before \\nwe make up our minds we ought to look about us. Let us go towards that light \\nin the north door. If we could find a window it would help, but I fear that \\nthe light comes only down deep shafts.\\' \\n\\nFollowing his lead the Company passed under the northern arch. They \\nfound themselves in a wide corridor. As they went along it the glimmer grew \\nstronger, and they saw that it came through a doorway on their right. It was \\nhigh and flat-topped, and the stone door was still upon its hinges, standing \\nhalf open. Beyond it was a large square chamber. It was dimly lit, but to \\ntheir eyes, after so long a time in the dark, it seemed dazzlingly bright, \\nand they blinked as they entered. \\n\\nTheir feet disturbed a deep dust upon the floor, and stumbled among \\nthings lying in the doorway whose shapes they could not at first make out. \\nThe chamber was lit by a wide shaft high in the further eastern wall; it \\nslanted upwards and, far above, a small square patch of blue sky could be \\nseen. The light of the shaft fell directly on a table in the middle of the \\nroom: a single oblong block, about two feet high, upon which was laid a \\ngreat slab of white stone. \\n\\n\\'It looks like a tomb,\\' muttered Frodo, and bent forwards with a \\ncurious sense of foreboding, to look more closely at it. Gandalf came \\nquickly to his side. On the slab runes were deeply graven: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThese are Daeron\\'s Runes, such as were used of old in Moria,\\' said \\nGandalf. \\'Here is written in the tongues of Men and Dwarves: \\nbalin son of fundin \\nlord of moria.\\' \\n\\n\\'He is dead then,\\' said Frodo. T feared it was so.\\' Gimli cast his \\nhood over his face. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 5 . The Bridge of Khazad-dym \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Company of the Ring stood silent beside the tomb of Balin. Frodo \\nthought of Bilbo and his long friendship with the dwarf, and of Balin\\'s \\nvisit to the Shire long ago. In that dusty chamber in the mountains it \\nseemed a thousand years ago and on the other side of the world. \\n\\nAt length they stirred and looked up, and began to search for anything \\nthat would give them tidings of Balin\\'s fate, or show what had become of his \\nfolk. There was another smaller door on the other side of the chamber, under \\nthe shaft. By both the doors they could now see that many bones were lying, \\nand among them were broken swords and axe-heads, and cloven shields and \\nhelms. Some of the swords were crooked: ore-scimitars with blackened blades. \\n\\nThere were many recesses cut in the rock of the walls, and in them were \\nlarge iron-bound chests of wood. All had been broken and plundered; but \\nbeside the shattered lid of one there lay the remains of a book. It had been \\nslashed and stabbed and partly burned, and it was so stained with black and \\nother dark marks like old blood that little of it could be read. Gandalf \\nlifted it carefully, but the leaves crackled and broke as he laid it on the \\nslab. He pored over it for some time without speaking. Frodo and Gimli \\nstanding at his side could see, as he gingerly turned the leaves, that they \\nwere written by many different hands, in runes, both of Moria and of Dale, \\nand here and there in Elvish script. \\n\\nAt last Gandalf looked up. \\'It seems to be a record of the fortunes of \\nBalin\\'s folk,\\' he said. V I guess that it began with their coming to Dimrill \\nDale nigh on thirty years ago: the pages seem to have numbers referring to \\nthe years after their arrival. The top page is marked one -- three, so at \\nleast two are missing from the beginning. Listen to this! \\n\\n\\'We drove out ores from the great gate and guard -- I think; the next \\nword is blurred and burned; probably room -- we slew many in the bright -- I \\nthink -- sun in the dale. Flui was killed by an arrow. He slew the great. \\n\\nThen there is a blur followed by Flui under grass near Mirror mere. The next \\nline or two I cannot read. Then comes We have taken the twentyfirst hall of \\nNorth end to dwell in. There is I cannot read what. A shaft is mentioned. \\n\\nThen Balin has set up his seat in the Chamber of Mazarbul.\\' \\n\\n\\'The Chamber of Records,\\' said Gimli. V I guess that is where we now \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstand.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, I can read no more for a long way,\\' said Gandalf, \\'except the \\nword gold , and Darin \\'s Axe and something helm. Then Balin is now lord of \\nMorici. That seems to end a chapter. After some stars another hand begins, \\nand I can see we found truesilver, and later the word wellforged and then \\nsomething, I have it! mithril; and the last two lines Uin to seek for the \\nupper armouries of Third Deep, something go westwards, a blur, to Hollin \\ngate\\' \\n\\nGandalf paused and set a few leaves aside. \\'There are several pages of \\nthe same sort, rather hastily written and much damaged, he said; \\'but I can \\nmake little of them in this light. Now there must be a number of leaves \\nmissing, because they begin to be numbered five, the fifth year of the \\ncolony, I suppose. Let me see! No, they are too cut and stained; I cannot \\nread them. We might do better in the sunlight. Wait! Here is something: a \\nlarge bold hand using an Elvish script.\\' \\n\\n\\'That would be Ori\\'s hand,\\' said Gimli, looking over the wizard\\'s arm. \\n\\n\\'He could write well and speedily, and often used the Elvish characters.\\' \\n\\n\\'I fear he had ill tidings to record in a fair hand,\\' said Gandalf. \\n\\n\\'The first clear word is sorrow, but the rest of the line is lost, unless it \\nends in estre. Yes, it must be yestre followed by day being the tenth of \\nnovembre Balin lord of Moria fell in Dimrill Dale. He went alone to look in \\nMirror mere, an ore shot him from behind a stone, we slew the ore, hut many \\nmore ...up from east up the Silverlode. The remainder of the page is so \\nblurred that I can hardly make anything out, but I think I can read we have \\nbarred the gates, and then can hold them long if, and then perhaps horrible \\nand suffer. Poor Balin! He seems to have kept the title that he took for \\nless than five years. I wonder what happened afterwards; but there is no \\ntime to puzzle out the last few pages. Here is the last page of all.\\' He \\npaused and sighed. \\n\\n\\'It is grim reading,\\' he said. \\'I fear their end was cruel. Listen! We \\ncannot get out. We cannot get out. They have taken the Bridge and second \\nhall. Frbr and Luni and Nbli fell there. Then there are four lines smeared \\nso that I can only read went 5 days ago. The last lines run the pool is up \\nto the wall at Westgate. The Watcher in the Water took Uin. We cannot get \\nout. The end comes, and then drums, drums in the deep. I wonder what that \\nmeans. The last thing written is in a trailing scrawl of elf-letters: they \\nare coming. There is nothing more.\\' Gandalf paused and stood in silent \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthought. \\n\\nA sudden dread and a horror of the chamber fell on the Company. \\' We \\ncannot get out,\\' muttered Gimli. \\'It was well for us that the pool had sunk \\na little, and that the Watcher was sleeping down at the southern end.\\' \\n\\nGandalf raised his head and looked round. \\'They seem to have made a \\nlast stand by both doors,\\' he said; \\'but there were not many left by that \\ntime. So ended the attempt to retake Moria! It was valiant but foolish. The \\ntime is not come yet. Now, I fear, we must say farewell to Balin son of \\nFundin. Here he must lie in the halls of his fathers. We will take this \\nbook, the Book of Mazarbul, and look at it more closely later. You had \\nbetter keep it, Gimli, and take it back to Dbin, if you get a chance. It \\nwill interest him, though it will grieve him deeply. Come, let us go! The \\nmorning is passing.\\' \\n\\n\\'Which way shall we go? \\' asked Boromir. \\n\\n\\'Back to the hall,\\' answered Gandalf. \\'But our visit to this room has \\nnot been in vain. I now know where we are. This must be, as Gimli says, the \\nChamber of Mazarbul; and the hall must be the twenty-first of the North-end. \\nTherefore we should leave by the eastern arch of the hall, and bear right \\nand south, and go downwards. The Twenty-first Hall should be on the Seventh \\nLevel, that is six above the level of the Gates. Come now! Back to the hall! \\n\\nf \\n\\nGandalf had hardly spoken these words, when there came a great noise: a \\nrolling Boom that seemed to come from depths far below, and to tremble in \\nthe stone at their feet. They sprang towards the door in alarm. Doom, doom \\nit rolled again, as if huge hands were turning the very caverns of Moria \\ninto a vast drum. Then there came an echoing blast: a great horn was blown \\nin the hall, and answering horns and harsh cries were heard further off. \\n\\nThere was a hurrying sound of many feet. \\n\\n\\'They are coming! \\' cried Legolas. \\n\\n\\'We cannot get out,\\' said Gimli. \\n\\n\\'Trapped! \\' cried Gandalf. \\'Why did I delay? Here we are, caught, just \\nas they were before. But I was not here then. We will see what -- \\' \\n\\nDoom, doom came the drum-beat and the walls shook. \\n\\n\\'Slam the doors and wedge them! \\' shouted Aragorn. \\'And keep your packs \\non as long as you can: we may get a chance to cut our way out yet.\\' \\n\\n\\'No! \\' said Gandalf. \\'We must not get shut in. Keep the east door ajar! \\n\\nWe will go that way, if we get a chance.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother harsh horn-call and shrill cries rang out. Feet were coming \\ndown the corridor. There was a ring and clatter as the Company drew their \\nswords. Glamdring shone with a pale light, and Sting glinted at the edges. \\nBoromir set his shoulder against the western door. \\n\\n\\'Wait a moment! Do not close it yet! \\' said Gandalf. He sprang forward \\nto Boromir\\'s side and drew himself up to his full height. \\n\\n\\'Who comes hither to disturb the rest of Balin Lord of Moria? \\' he \\ncried in a loud voice. \\n\\nThere was a rush of hoarse laughter, like the fall of sliding stones \\ninto a pit; amid the clamour a deep voice was raised in command. Doom, \\nboom, \\n\\ndoom went the drums in the deep. \\n\\nWith a quick movement Gandalf stepped before the narrow opening of the \\ndoor and thrust forward his staff: There was a dazzling flash that lit the \\nchamber and the passage outside. For an instant the wizard looked out. \\nArrows whined and whistled down the corridor as he sprang back. \\n\\n\\'There are Ores, very many of them,\\' he said. \\'And some are large and \\nevil: black Uruks of Mordor. For the moment they are hanging back, but there \\nis something else there. A great cave-troll, I think, or more than one. \\n\\nThere is no hope of escape that way.\\' \\n\\n\\'And no hope at all, if they come at the other door as well,\\' said \\nBoromir. \\n\\n\\'There is no sound outside here yet,\\' said Aragorn, who was standing by \\nthe eastern door listening. \\'The passage on this side plunges straight down \\na stair: it plainly does not lead back towards the hall. But it is no good \\nflying blindly this way with the pursuit just behind. We cannot block the \\ndoor. Its key is gone and the lock is broken, and it opens inwards. We must \\ndo something to delay the enemy first. We will make them fear the Chamber of \\nMazarbul!\\' he said grimly feeling the edge of his sword, And(r)ril. \\n\\nHeavy feet were heard in the corridor. Boromir flung himself against \\nthe door and heaved it to; then he wedged it with broken sword-blades and \\nsplinters of wood. The Company retreated to the other side of the chamber. \\nBut they had no chance to fly yet. There was a blow on the door that made it \\nquiver; and then it began to grind slowly open, driving back the wedges. A \\nhuge arm and shoulder, with a dark skin of greenish scales, was thrust \\nthrough the widening gap. Then a great, flat, toeless foot was forced \\nthrough below. There was a dead silence outside. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBoromir leaped forward and hewed at the arm with all his might; but his \\nsword rang, glanced aside, and fell from his shaken hand. The blade was \\nnotched. \\n\\nSuddenly, and to his own surprise, Frodo felt a hot wrath blaze up in \\nhis heart. \\'The Shire! \\' he cried, and springing beside Boromir, he stooped, \\nand stabbed with Sting at the hideous foot. There was a bellow, and the foot \\njerked back, nearly wrenching Sting from Frodo\\'s arm. Black drops dripped \\nfrom the blade and smoked on the floor. Boromir hurled himself against the \\ndoor and slammed it again. \\n\\n\\'One for the Shire! \\' cried Aragorn. \\'The hobbit\\'s bite is deep! You \\nhave a good blade, Frodo son of Drogo ! \\' \\n\\nThere was a crash on the door, followed by crash after crash. Rams and \\nhammers were beating against it. It cracked and staggered back, and the \\nopening grew suddenly wide. Arrows came whistling in, but struck the \\nnorthern wall, and fell harmlessly to the floor. There was a horn-blast and \\na rush of feet, and ores one after another leaped into the chamber. \\n\\nHow many there were the Company could not count. The affray was sharp, \\nbut the ores were dismayed by the fierceness of the defence. Legolas shot \\ntwo through the throat. Gimli hewed the legs from under another that had \\nsprung up on Balin\\' s tomb. Boromir and Aragorn slew many. When thirteen \\nhad \\n\\nfallen the rest fled shrieking, leaving the defenders unharmed, except for \\nSam who had a scratch along the scalp. A quick duck had saved him; and he \\nhad felled his ore: a sturdy thrust with his Barrow-blade. A fire was \\nsmouldering in his brown eyes that would have made Ted Sandyman step \\nbackwards, if he had seen it. \\n\\n\\'Now is the time! \\' cried Gandalf. \\'Let us go, before the troll \\nreturns!\\' \\n\\nBut even as they retreated, and before Pippin and Merry had reached the \\nstair outside, a huge ore-chieftain, almost man-high, clad in black mail \\nfrom head to foot, leaped into the chamber; behind him his followers \\nclustered in the doorway. His broad flat face was swart, his eyes were like \\ncoals, and his tongue was red; he wielded a great spear. With a thrust of \\nhis huge hide shield he turned Boromir\\'s sword and bore him backwards, \\nthrowing him to the ground. Diving under Aragorn\\'s blow with the speed of a \\nstriking snake he charged into the Company and thrust with his spear \\nstraight at Frodo. The blow caught him on the right side, and Frodo was \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhurled against the wall and pinned. Sam, with a cry, hacked at the \\nspear- shaft, and it broke. But even as the ore flung down the truncheon and \\nswept out his scimitar, And(r)ril came down upon his helm. There was a flash \\nlike flame and the helm burst asunder. The ore fell with cloven head. His \\nfollowers fled howling, as Boromir and Aragorn sprang at them. \\n\\nDoom, doom went the drums in the deep. The great voice rolled out \\nagain. \\n\\n\\'Now! \\' shouted Gandalf. \\'Now is the last chance. Run for it! \\' \\n\\nAragorn picked up Frodo where he lay by the wall and made for the \\nstair, pushing Merry and Pippin in front of him. The others followed; but \\nGimli had to be dragged away by Legolas: in spite of the peril he lingered \\nby Balin\\'s tomb with his head bowed. Boromir hauled the eastern door to, \\ngrinding upon its hinges: it had great iron rings on either side, but could \\nnot be fastened. \\n\\n\\'I am all right,\\' gasped Frodo. \\'I can walk. Put me down! \\' \\n\\nAragorn nearly dropped him in his amazement. \\'I thought you were dead! \\n\\n\\' he cried. \\n\\n\\'Not yet! \\' said Gandalf. \\'But there is time for wonder. Off you go, \\nall of you, down the stairs! Wait a few minutes for me at the bottom, but if \\nI do not come soon, go on! Go quickly and choose paths leading right and \\ndownwards.\\' \\n\\n\\'We cannot leave you to hold the door alone! \\' said Aragorn. \\n\\n\\'Do as I say! \\' said Gandalf fiercely. \\'Swords are no more use here. \\n\\nGo!\\' \\n\\nThe passage was lit by no shaft and was utterly dark. They groped their \\nway down a long flight of steps, and then looked back; but they could see \\nnothing, except high above them the faint glimmer of the wizard\\'s staff. He \\nseemed to be still standing on guard by the closed door. Frodo breathed \\nheavily and leaned against Sam, who put his arms about him. They stood \\npeering up the stairs into the darkness. Frodo thought he could hear the \\nvoice of Gandalf above, muttering words that ran down the sloping roof with \\na sighing echo. He could not catch what was said. The walls seemed to be \\ntrembling. Every now and again the drum-beats throbbed and rolled: doom, \\ndoom. \\n\\nSuddenly at the top of the stair there was a stab of white light. Then \\nthere was a dull rumble and a heavy thud. The drum-beats broke out wildly: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndoom-boom, doom-boom, and then stopped. Gandalf came flying down the \\nsteps \\n\\nand fell to the ground in the midst of the Company. \\n\\n\\'Well, well! That\\'s over! \\' said the wizard struggling to his feet. \\'I \\nhave done all that I could. But I have met my match, and have nearly been \\ndestroyed. But don\\'t stand here! Go on! You will have to do without light \\nfor a while: I am rather shaken. Go on! Go on! Where are you, Gimli? Come \\nahead with me! Keep close behind, all of you!\\' \\n\\nThey stumbled after him wondering what had happened. Doom, doom \\nwent \\n\\nthe drum-beats again: they now sounded muffled and far away, but they were \\nfollowing. There was no other sound of pursuit, neither tramp of feet, nor \\nany voice. Gandalf took no turns, right or left, for the passage seemed to \\nbe going in the direction that he desired. Every now and again it descended \\na flight of steps, fifty or more, to a lower level. At the moment that was \\ntheir chief danger; for in the dark they could not see a descent, until they \\ncame on it, and put their feet out into emptiness. Gandalf felt the ground \\nwith his staff like a blind man. \\n\\nAt the end of an hour they had gone a mile, or maybe a little more, and \\nhad descended many flights of stairs. There was still no sound of pursuit. \\nAlmost they began to hope that they would escape. At the bottom of the \\nseventh flight Gandalf halted. \\n\\n\\'It is getting hot! \\' he gasped. \\'We ought to be down at least to the \\nlevel of the Gates now. Soon I think we should look for a left-hand turn to \\ntake us east. I hope it is not far. I am very weary. I must rest here a \\nmoment, even if all the ores ever spawned are after us.\\' \\n\\nGimli took his arm and helped him down to a seat on the step. \\'What \\nhappened away up there at the door? \\' he asked. \\'Did you meet the beater of \\nthe drums? \\' \\n\\n\\'I do not know,\\' answered Gandalf. \\'But I found myself suddenly faced \\nby something that I have not met before. I could think of nothing to do but \\nto try and put a shutting -spell on the door. I know many; but to do things \\nof that kind rightly requires time, and even then the door can be broken by \\nstrength. \\n\\n\\'As I stood there I could hear ore- voices on the other side: at any \\nmoment I thought they would burst it open. I could not hear what was said; \\nthey seemed to be talking in their own hideous language. All I caught was \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nghvsh; that is \"fire\". Then something came into the chamber -- I felt it \\nthrough the door, and the ores themselves were afraid and fell silent. It \\nlaid hold of the iron ring, and then it perceived me and my spell. \\n\\n\\'What it was I cannot guess, but I have never felt such a challenge. \\n\\nThe counter-spell was terrible. It nearly broke me. For an instant the door \\nleft my control and began to open ! I had to speak a word of Command. That \\nproved too great a strain. The door burst in pieces. Something dark as a \\ncloud was blocking out all the light inside, and I was thrown backwards down \\nthe stairs. All the wall gave way, and the roof of the chamber as well, I \\nthink. \\n\\n\\'I am afraid Balin is buried deep, and maybe something else is buried \\nthere too. I cannot say. But at least the passage behind us was completely \\nblocked. Ah! I have never felt so spent, but it is passing. And now what \\nabout you, Frodo? There was not time to say so, but I have never been more \\ndelighted in my life than when you spoke. I feared that it was a brave but \\ndead hobbit that Aragorn was carrying.\\' \\n\\n\\'What about me? \\' said Frodo. \\'I am alive, and whole I think. I am \\nbruised and in pain, but it is not too bad.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well,\\' said Aragorn, \\'I can only say that hobbits are made of a stuff \\nso tough that I have never met the like of it. Had I known, I would have \\nspoken softer in the Inn at Bree! That spear -thrust would have skewered a \\nwild boar! \\' \\n\\n\\'Well, it did not skewer me, I am glad to say,\\' said Frodo; \\'though I \\nfeel as if I had been caught between a hammer and an anvil.\\' He said no \\nmore. He found breathing painful. \\n\\n\\'You take after Bilbo,\\' said Gandalf. \\'There is more about you than \\nmeets the eye, as I said of him long ago.\\' Frodo wondered if the remark \\nmeant more than it said. \\n\\nThey now went on again. Before long Gimli spoke. He had keen eyes in \\nthe dark. \\'I think,\\' he said, \\'that there is a light ahead. But it is not \\ndaylight. It is red. What can it be? \\' \\n\\n\\' Ghvsh !\\' muttered Gandalf. \\'I wonder if that is what they meant: that \\nthe lower levels are on fire? Still, we can only go on.\\' \\n\\nSoon the light became unmistakable, and could be seen by all. It was \\nflickering and glowing on the walls away down the passage before them. They \\ncould now see their way: in front the road sloped down swiftly, and some way \\nahead there stood a low archway; through it the glowing light came. The air \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbecame very hot. \\n\\nWhen they came to the arch Gandalf went through, signing to them to \\nwait. As he stood just beyond the opening they saw his face lit by a red \\nglow. Quickly he stepped back. \\n\\n\\'There is some new devilry here,\\' he said, \\'devised for our welcome no \\ndoubt. But I know now where we are: we have reached the First Deep, the \\nlevel immediately below the Gates. This is the Second Hall of Old Moria; and \\nthe Gates are near: away beyond the eastern end, on the left, not more than \\na quarter of a mile. Across the Bridge, up a broad stair, along a wide road \\nthrough the First Hall, and out! But come and look! \\' \\n\\nThey peered out. Before them was another cavernous hall. It was loftier \\nand far longer than the one in which they had slept. They were near its \\neastern end; westward it ran away into darkness. Down the centre stalked a \\ndouble line of towering pillars. They were carved like boles of mighty trees \\nwhose boughs upheld the roof with a branching tracery of stone. Their stems \\nwere smooth and black, but a red glow was darkly mirrored in their sides. \\nRight across the floor, close to the feet of two huge pillars a great \\nfissure had opened. Out of it a fierce red light came, and now and again \\nflames licked at the brink and curled about the bases of the columns. Wisps \\nof dark smoke wavered in the hot air. \\n\\n\\'If we had come by the main road down from the upper halls, we should \\nhave been trapped here,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Let us hope that the fire now lies \\nbetween us and pursuit. Come! There is no time to lose.\\' \\n\\nEven as he spoke they heard again the pursuing drum-beat: Doom, doom, \\ndoom. Away beyond the shadows at the western end of the hall there came \\ncries and horn-calls. Doom, doom : the pillars seemed to tremble and the \\nflames to quiver. \\n\\n\\'Now for the last race! \\' said Gandalf. \\'If the sun is shining outside \\nwe may still escape. After me! \\' \\n\\nHe turned left and sped across the smooth floor of the hall. The \\ndistance was greater than it had looked. As they ran they heard the beat and \\necho of many hurrying feet behind. A shrill yell went up: they had been \\nseen. There was a ring and clash of steel. An arrow whistled over Frodo\\'s \\nhead. \\n\\nBoromir laughed. \\'They did not expect this,\\' he said. \\'The fire has cut \\nthem off. We are on the wrong side! \\' \\n\\n\\'Look ahead! \\' called Gandalf. \\'The Bridge is near. It is dangerous and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnarrow.\\' \\n\\nSuddenly Frodo saw before him a black chasm. At the end of the hall the \\nfloor vanished and fell to an unknown depth. The outer door could only be \\nreached by a slender bridge of stone, without kerb or rail, that spanned the \\nchasm with one curving spring of fifty feet. It was an ancient defence of \\nthe Dwarves against any enemy that might capture the First Hall and the \\nouter passages. They could only pass across it in single file. At the brink \\nGandalf halted and the others came up in a pack behind. \\n\\n\\'Lead the way, Gimli! \\' he said. \\'Pippin and Merry next. Straight on \\nand up the stair beyond the door! \\' \\n\\nArrows fell among them. One struck Frodo and sprang back. Another \\npierced Gandalf s hat and stuck there like a black feather. Frodo looked \\nbehind. Beyond the fire he saw swarming black figures: there seemed to be \\nhundreds of ores. They brandished spears and scimitars which shone red as \\nblood in the firelight. Doom, doom rolled the drum-beats, growing louder and \\nlouder, doom, doom. \\n\\nLegolas turned and set an arrow to the string, though it was a long \\nshot for his small bow. He drew, but his hand fell, and the arrow slipped to \\nthe ground. He gave a cry of dismay and fear. Two great trolls appeared; \\nthey bore great slabs of stone, and flung them down to serve as gangways \\nover the fire. But it was not the trolls that had filled the Elf with \\nterror. The ranks of the ores had opened, and they crowded away, as if they \\nthemselves were afraid. Something was coming up behind them. What it was \\ncould not be seen: it was like a great shadow, in the middle of which was a \\ndark form, of man-shape maybe, yet greater; and a power and terror seemed to \\nbe in it and to go before it. \\n\\nIt came to the edge of the fire and the light faded as if a cloud had \\nbent over it. Then with a rush it leaped across the fissure. The flames \\nroared up to greet it, and wreathed about it; and a black smoke swirled in \\nthe air. Its streaming mane kindled, and blazed behind it. In its right hand \\nwas a blade like a stabbing tongue of fire; in its left it held a whip of \\nmany thongs. \\n\\n\\'Ai! ai! \\' wailed Legolas. \\'A Balrog! A Balrog is come! \\' \\n\\nGimli stared with wide eyes. \\'Durin\\'s Bane! \\' he cried, and letting his \\naxe fall he covered his face. \\n\\n\\'A Balrog,\\' muttered Gandalf. \\'Now I understand.\\' He faltered and \\nleaned heavily on his staff. \\'What an evil fortune! And I am already weary.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe dark figure streaming with fire raced towards them. The ores yelled \\nand poured over the stone gangways. Then Boromir raised his horn and blew. \\nLoud the challenge rang and bellowed, like the shout of many throats under \\nthe cavernous roof. For a moment the ores quailed and the fiery shadow \\nhalted. Then the echoes died as suddenly as a flame blown out by a dark \\nwind, and the enemy advanced again. \\n\\n\\'Over the bridge!\\' cried Gandalf, recalling his strength. \"Fly ! This is \\na foe beyond any of you. I must hold the narrow way. Fly! \\' Aragorn and \\nBoromir did not heed the command, but still held their ground, side by side, \\nbehind Gandalf at the far end of the bridge. The others halted just within \\nthe doorway at the hall\\'s end, and turned, unable to leave their leader to \\nface the enemy alone. \\n\\nThe Balrog reached the bridge. Gandalf stood in the middle of the span, \\nleaning on the staff in his left hand, but in his other hand Glamdring \\ngleamed, cold and white. His enemy halted again, facing him, and the shadow \\nabout it reached out like two vast wings. It raised the whip, and the thongs \\nwhined and cracked. Fire came from its nostrils. But Gandalf stood firm. \\n\\n\\'You cannot pass,\\' he said. The ores stood still, and a dead silence \\nfell. V I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. You \\ncannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udyn. Go back to the \\nShadow! You cannot pass.\\' \\n\\nThe Balrog made no answer. The fire in it seemed to die, but the \\ndarkness grew. It stepped forward slowly on to the bridge, and suddenly it \\ndrew itself up to a great height, and its wings were spread from wall to \\nwall; but still Gandalf could be seen, glimmering in the gloom; he seemed \\nsmall, and altogether alone: grey and bent, like a wizened tree before the \\nonset of a storm. \\n\\nFrom out of the shadow a red sword leaped flaming. \\n\\nGlamdring glittered white in answer. \\n\\nThere was a ringing clash and a stab of white fire. The Balrog fell \\nback and its sword flew up in molten fragments. The wizard swayed on the \\nbridge, stepped back a pace, and then again stood still. \\n\\n\\'You cannot pass! \\' he said. \\n\\nWith a bound the Balrog leaped full upon the bridge. Its whip whirled \\nand hissed. \\n\\n\\'He cannot stand alone! \\' cried Aragorn suddenly and ran back along the \\nbridge. \\'Elendil!\\' he shouted. \\'I am with you, Gandalf! \\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Gondor! \\' cried Boromir and leaped after him. \\n\\nAt that moment Gandalf lifted his staff, and crying aloud he smote the \\nbridge before him. The staff broke asunder and fell from his hand. A \\nblinding sheet of white flame sprang up. The bridge cracked. Right at the \\nBalrog\\'s feet it broke, and the stone upon which it stood crashed into the \\ngulf, while the rest remained, poised, quivering like a tongue of rock \\nthrust out into emptiness. \\n\\nWith a terrible cry the Balrog fell forward, and its shadow plunged \\ndown and vanished. But even as it fell it swung its whip, and the thongs \\nlashed and curled about the wizard\\'s knees, dragging him to the brink. He \\nstaggered and fell, grasped vainly at the stone, and slid into the abyss. \\n\\n\\'Fly, you fools! \\' he cried, and was gone. \\n\\nThe fires went out, and blank darkness fell. The Company stood rooted \\nwith horror staring into the pit. Even as Aragorn and Boromir came flying \\nback, the rest of the bridge cracked and fell. With a cry Aragorn roused \\nthem. \\n\\n\\'Come! I will lead you now ! \\' he called. \\'We must obey his last \\ncommand. Follow me! \\' \\n\\nThey stumbled wildly up the great stairs beyond the door. Aragorn \\nleading, Boromir at the rear. At the top was a wide echoing passage. Along \\nthis they fled. Frodo heard Sam at his side weeping, and then he found that \\nhe himself was weeping as he ran. Doom, doom, doom the drum-beats rolled \\nbehind, mournful now and slow; doom! \\n\\nThey ran on. The light grew before them; great shafts pierced the roof. \\n\\nThey ran swifter. They passed into a hall, bright with daylight from its \\nhigh windows in the east. They fled across it. Through its huge broken doors \\nthey passed, and suddenly before them the Great Gates opened, an arch of \\nblazing light. \\n\\nThere was a guard of ores crouching in the shadows behind the great \\ndoor posts towering on either side, but the gates were shattered and cast \\ndown. Aragorn smote to the ground the captain that stood in his path, and \\nthe rest fled in terror of his wrath. The Company swept past them and took \\nno heed of them. Out of the Gates they ran and sprang down the huge and \\nage-worn steps, the threshold of Moria. \\n\\nThus, at last, they came beyond hope under the sky and felt the wind on \\ntheir faces. \\n\\nThey did not halt until they were out of bowshot from the walls. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDimrill Dale lay about them. The shadow of the Misty Mountains lay upon it, \\nbut eastwards there was a golden light on the land. It was but one hour \\nafter noon. The sun was shining; the clouds were white and high. \\n\\nThey looked back. Dark yawned the archway of the Gates under the \\nmountain-shadow. Faint and far beneath the earth rolled the slow drum-beats: \\ndoom. A thin black smoke trailed out. Nothing else was to be seen; the dale \\nall around was empty. Doom. Grief at last wholly overcame them, and they \\nwept long: some standing and silent, some cast upon the ground. Doom, doom. \\nThe drum-beats faded. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 6 . Lothlurien \\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Alas! I Fear we cannot stay here longer,\\' said Aragorn. He looked \\ntowards the mountains and held up his sword. \\'Farewell, Gandalf ! \\' he cried. \\n\\'Did I not say to you: if you pass the doors of Moria, bewarel Alas that I \\nspoke true! What hope have we without you? \\' \\n\\nHe turned to the Company. \\'We must do without hope,\\' he said. \\'At least \\nwe may yet be avenged. Let us gird ourselves and weep no more! Come! We \\nhave \\n\\na long road, and much to do.\\' \\n\\nThey rose and looked about them. Northward the dale ran up into a glen \\nof shadows between two great arms of the mountains, above which three white \\npeaks were shining: Celebdil, Fanuidhol, Caradhras. the Mountains of Moria. \\nAt the head of the glen a torrent flowed like a white lace over an endless \\nladder of short falls, and a mist of foam hung in the air about the \\nmountains\\' feet. \\n\\n\\'Yonder is the Dimrill Stair,\\' said Aragorn, pointing to the falls. \\n\\n\\'Down the deep-cloven way that climbs beside the torrent we should have \\ncome, if fortune had been kinder.\\' \\n\\n\\'Or Caradhras less cruel,\\' said Gimli. \\'There he stands smiling in the \\nsun! \\' He shook his fist at the furthest of the snow-capped peaks and turned \\naway. \\n\\nTo the east the outflung arm of the mountains marched to a sudden end, \\nand far lands could be descried beyond them, wide and vague. To the south \\nthe Misty Mountains receded endlessly as far as sight could reach. Less than \\na mile away, and a little below them, for they still stood high up on the \\nwest side of the dale, there lay a mere. It was long and oval, shaped like a \\ngreat spear-head thrust deep into the northern glen; but its southern end \\nwas beyond the shadows under the sunlit sky. Yet its waters were dark: a \\ndeep blue like clear evening sky seen from a lamp-lit room. Its face was \\nstill and unruffled. About it lay a smooth sward, shelving down on all sides \\nto its bare unbroken rim. \\n\\n\\'There lies the Mirrormere, deep Kheled-zvram! \\' said Gimli sadly. \\'I \\nremember that he said: \"May you have joy of the sight! But we cannot linger \\nthere.\" Now long shall I journey ere I have joy again. It is I that must \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhasten away, and he that must remain.\\' \\n\\nThe Company now went down the road from the Gates. It was rough and \\nbroken, fading to a winding track between heather and whin that thrust amid \\nthe cracking stones. But still it could be seen that once long ago a great \\npaved way had wound upwards from the lowlands of the Dwarf-kingdom. \\n\\nIn \\n\\nplaces there were ruined works of stone beside the path, and mounds of green \\ntopped with slender birches, or fir-trees sighing in the wind. An eastward \\nbend led them hard by the sward of Mirrormere, and there not far from the \\nroadside stood a single column broken at the top. \\n\\n\\'That is Durin\\'s Stone! \\' cried Gimli. \\'I cannot pass without turning \\naside for a moment to look at the wonder of the dale ! \\' \\n\\n\\'Be swift then! \\' said Aragorn, looking back towards the Gates. \\'The \\nSun sinks early. The Ores will not, maybe, come out till after dusk, but we \\nmust be far away before nightfall. The Moon is almost spent, and it will be \\ndark tonight.\\' \\n\\n\\'Come with me, Frodo! \\' cried the dwarf, springing from the road. \\'I \\nwould not have you go without seeing Kheled-zvram.\\' He ran down the long \\ngreen slope. Frodo followed slowly, drawn by the still blue water in spite \\nof hurt and weariness; Sam came up behind. \\n\\nBeside the standing stone Gimli halted and looked up. It was cracked \\nand weather-worn, and the faint runes upon its side could not be read. \\'This \\npillar marks the spot where Durin first looked in the Mirrormere,\\' said the \\ndwarf. \\'Let us look ourselves once, ere we go!\\' \\n\\nThey stooped over the dark water. At first they could see nothing. Then \\nslowly they saw the forms of the encircling mountains mirrored in a profound \\nblue, and the peaks were like plumes of white flame above them; beyond there \\nwas a space of sky. There like jewels sunk in the deep shone glinting stars, \\nthough sunlight was in the sky above. Of their own stooping forms no shadow \\ncould be seen. \\n\\n\\'O Kheled-zvram fair and wonderful! \\' said Gimli. \\'There lies the Crown \\nof Durin till he wakes. Farewell! \\' He bowed, and turned away, and hastened \\nback up the green-sward to the road again. \\n\\n\\'What did you see? \\' said Pippin to Sam, but Sam was too deep in \\nthought to answer. \\n\\nThe road now turned south and went quickly downwards, running out from \\nbetween the arms of the dale. Some way below the mere they came on a deep \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwell of water, clear as crystal, from which a freshet fell over a stone lip \\nand ran glistening and gurgling down a steep rocky channel. \\n\\n\\'Here is the spring from which the Silverlode rises.\\' said Gimli. \\'Do \\nnot drink of it! It is icy cold.\\' \\n\\n\\'Soon it becomes a swift river, and it gathers water from many other \\nmountain- streams,\\' said Aragorn. \\'Our road leads beside it for many miles. \\nFor I shall take you by the road that Gandalf chose, and first I hope to \\ncome to the woods where the Silverlode flows into the Great River-out \\nyonder.\\' They looked as he pointed, and before them they could see the \\nstream leaping down to the trough of the valley, and then running on and \\naway into the lower lands, until it was lost in a golden haze. \\n\\n\\'There lie the woods of Lothlurien! \\' said Legolas. \\'That is the \\nfairest of all the dwellings of my people. There are no trees like the trees \\nof that land. For in the autumn their leaves fall not, but turn to gold. Not \\ntill the spring comes and the new green opens do they fall, and then the \\nboughs are laden with yellow flowers; and the floor of the wood is golden, \\nand golden is the roof, and its pillars are of silver, for the bark of the \\ntrees is smooth and grey. So still our songs in Mirkwood say. My heart would \\nbe glad if I were beneath the eaves of that wood, and it were springtime ! \\' \\n\\n\\'My heart will be glad, even in the winter,\\' said Aragorn. \\'But it lies \\nmany miles away. Let us hasten! \\' \\n\\nFor some time Frodo and Sam managed to keep up with the others; but \\nAragorn was leading them at a great pace, and after a while they lagged \\nbehind. They had eaten nothing since the early morning. Sam\\'s cut was \\nburning like fire, and his head felt light. In spite of the shining sun the \\nwind seemed chill after the warm darkness of Moria. He shivered. Frodo felt \\nevery step more painful and he gasped for breath. \\n\\nAt last Legolas turned, and seeing them now far behind, he spoke to \\nAragorn. The others halted, and Aragorn ran back, calling to Boromir to come \\nwith him. \\n\\n\\'I am sorry, Frodo! \\' he cried, full of concern. \\'So much has happened \\nthis day and we have such need of haste, that I have forgotten that you were \\nhurt; and Sam too. You should have spoken. We have done nothing to ease \\nyou, \\n\\nas we ought, though all the ores of Moria were after us. Come now! A little \\nfurther on there is a place where we can rest for a little. There I will do \\nwhat I can for you. Come, Boromir! We will carry them.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSoon afterwards they came upon another stream that ran down from the \\nwest, and joined its bubbling water with the hurrying Silverlode. Together \\nthey plunged over a fall of green-hued stone, and foamed down into a dell. \\nAbout it stood fir-trees, short and bent, and its sides were steep and \\nclothed with harts-tongue and shrubs of whortle -berry. At the bottom there \\nwas a level space through which the stream flowed noisily over shining \\npebbles. Here they rested. It was now nearly three hours after noon, and \\nthey had come only a few miles from the Gates. Already the sun was \\nwestering. \\n\\nWhile Gimli and the two younger hobbits kindled a fire of brush- and \\nfir-wood, and drew water, Aragorn tended Sam and Frodo. Sam\\'s wound was \\nnot \\n\\ndeep, but it looked ugly, and Aragorn\\'s face was grave as he examined it. \\nAfter a moment he looked up with relief. \\n\\n\\'Good luck, Sam! \\' he said. \\'Many have received worse than this in \\npayment for the slaying of their first ore. The cut is not poisoned, as the \\nwounds of ore-blades too often are. It should heal well when I have tended \\nit. Bathe it when Gimli has heated water.\\' \\n\\nHe opened his pouch and drew out some withered leaves. \\'They are dry \\nand some of their virtue has one, he said, but here I have still some of the \\nleaves of athelas that I gathered near Weathertop. Crush one in the water, \\nand wash the wound clean, and I will bind it. Now it is your turn. Frodo! \\' \\n\\n\\'I am all right,\\' said Frodo, reluctant to have his garments touched. \\n\\n\\'All I needed was some food and a little rest.\\' \\n\\n\\'No! \\' said Aragorn. \\'We must have a look and see what the hammer and \\nthe anvil have done to you. I still marvel that you are alive at all.\\' \\n\\nGently he stripped off Frodo\\'s old jacket and worn tunic, and gave a gasp of \\nwonder. Then he laughed. The silver corslet shimmered before his eyes like \\nthe light upon a rippling sea. Carefully he took it off and held it up, and \\nthe gems on it glittered like stars, and the sound of the shaken rings was \\nlike the tinkle of rain in a pool. \\n\\n\\'Look, my friends!\\' he called. \\'Here\\'s a pretty hobbit-skin to wrap an \\nel ven -princeling in! If it were known that hobbits had such hides, all the \\nhunters of Middle-earth would be riding to the Shire.\\' \\n\\n\\'And all the arrows of all the hunters in the world would be in vain,\\' \\nsaid Gimli, gazing at the mail in wonder. \\'It is a mithril-coat. Mithril! I \\nhave never seen or heard tell of one so fair. Is this the coat that Gandalf \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nspoke of? Then he undervalued it. But it was well given! \\' \\n\\n\\'I have often wondered what you and Bilbo were doing, so close in his \\nlittle room,\\' said Merry. \\'Bless the old hobbit! I love him more than ever. \\n\\nI hope we get a chance of telling him about it! \\' \\n\\nThere was a dark and blackened bruise on Frodo\\'s right side and breast. \\nUnder the mail there was a shirt of soft leather, but at one point the rings \\nhad been driven through it into the flesh. Frodo\\'s left side also was scored \\nand bruised where he had been hurled against the wall. While the others set \\nthe food ready. Aragorn bathed the hurts with water in which athelas was \\nsteeped. The pungent fragrance filled the dell, and all those who stooped \\nover the steaming water felt refreshed and strengthened. Soon Frodo felt the \\npain leave him, and his breath grew easy: though he was stiff and sore to \\nthe touch for many days. Aragorn bound some soft pads of cloth at his side. \\n\\n\\'The mail is marvellously light,\\' he said. \\'Put it on again, if you can \\nbear it. My heart is glad to know that you have such a coat. Do not lay it \\naside, even in sleep, unless fortune brings you where you are safe for a \\nwhile; and that will seldom chance while your quest lasts.\\' \\n\\nWhen they had eaten, the Company got ready to go on. They put out the \\nfire and hid all traces of it. Then climbing out of the dell they took to \\nthe road again. They had not gone far before the sun sank behind the \\nwestward heights and great shadows crept down the mountain-sides. Dusk \\nveiled their feet, and mist rose in the hollows. Away in the east the \\nevening light lay pale upon the dim lands of distant plain and wood. Sam and \\nFrodo now feeling eased and greatly refreshed were able to go at a fair \\npace, and with only one brief halt Aragorn led the Company on for nearly \\nthree more hours. \\n\\nIt was dark. Deep night had fallen. There were many clear stars, hut \\nthe fast- waning moon would not be seen till late. Gimli and Frodo were at \\nthe rear, walking softly and not speaking, listening for any sound upon the \\nroad behind. At length Gimli broke the silence. \\n\\n\\'Not a sound but the wind,\\' he said. \\'There are no goblins near, or my \\nears are made of wood. It is to be hoped that the Ores will be content with \\ndriving us from Moria. And maybe that was all their purpose, and they had \\nnothing else to do with us-with the Ring. Though Ores will often pursue foes \\nfor many leagues into the plain, if they have a fallen captain to avenge.\\' \\n\\nFrodo did not answer. He looked at Sting, and the blade was dull. Yet \\nhe had heard something, or thought he had. As soon as the shadows had fallen \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nabout them and the road behind was dim, he had heard again the quick patter \\nof feet. Even now he heard it. He turned swiftly. There were two tiny gleams \\nof light behind, or for a moment he thought he saw them, but at once they \\nslipped aside and vanished. \\n\\n\\'What is it? \\' said the dwarf. \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know.\\' answered Frodo. \\'I thought I heard feet, and I thought \\nI saw a light-like eyes. I have thought so often, since we first entered \\nMoria.\\' \\n\\nGimli halted and stooped to the ground. \\'I hear nothing but the \\nnight-speech of plant and stone,\\' he said. \\'Come! Let us hurry! The others \\nare out of sight.\\' \\n\\nThe night-wind blew chill up the valley to meet them. Before them a \\nwide grey shadow loomed, and they heard an endless rustle of leaves like \\npoplars in the breeze. \\n\\n\\'Lothlurien! \\' cried Legolas. \\'Lothlurien! We have come to the eaves of \\nthe Golden Wood. Alas that it is winter! \\' \\n\\nUnder the night the trees stood tall before them, arched over the road \\nand stream that ran suddenly beneath their spreading boughs. In the dim \\nlight of the stars their stems were grey, and their quivering leaves a hint \\nof fallow gold. \\n\\n\\'Lothlurien! \\' said Aragorn. \\'Glad I am to hear again the wind in the \\ntrees! We are still little more than five leagues from the Gates, but we can \\ngo no further. Here let us hope that the virtue of the Elves will keep us \\ntonight from the peril that comes behind.\\' \\n\\n\\'If Elves indeed still dwell here in the darkening world,\\' said Gimli. \\n\\n\\'It is long since any of my own folk journeyed hither back to the land \\nwhence we wandered in ages long ago,\\' said Legolas, \\'but we hear that Lurien \\nis not yet deserted, for there is a secret power here that holds evil from \\nthe land. Nevertheless its folk are seldom seen, and maybe they dwell now \\ndeep in the woods and far from the northern border.\\' \\n\\n\\'Indeed deep in the wood they dwell,\\' said Aragorn, and sighed as if \\nsome memory stirred in him. \\'We must fend for ourselves tonight. We will go \\nforward a short way, until the trees are all about us, and then we will turn \\naside from the path and seek a place to rest in.\\' \\n\\nHe stepped forward; but Boromir stood irresolute and did not follow. \\n\\n\\'Is there no other way? \\' he said. \\n\\n\\'What other fairer way would you desire? \\' said Aragorn. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'A plain road, though it led through a hedge of swords,\\' said Boromir. \\n\\n\\'By strange paths has this Company been led, and so far to evil fortune. \\nAgainst my will we passed under the shades of Moria, to our loss. And now we \\nmust enter the Golden Wood, you say. But of that perilous land we have heard \\nin Gondor, and it is said that few come out who once go in; and of that few \\nnone have escaped unscathed.\\' \\n\\n\\'Say not unscathed, but if you say unchanged, then maybe you will speak \\nthe truth said Aragorn. But lore wanes in Gondor, Boromir, if in the city of \\nthose who once were wise they now speak evil of Lothlurien. Believe what you \\nwill, there is no other way for us -- unless you would go back to \\nMoria-gate, or scale the pathless mountains, or swim the Great River all \\nalone.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then lead on! \\' said Boromir. \\'But it is perilous.\\' \\n\\n\\'Perilous indeed,\\' said Aragorn, \\'fair and perilous; but only evil need \\nfear it, or those who bring some evil with them. Follow me! \\' \\n\\nThey had gone little more than a mile into the forest when they came \\nupon another stream flowing down swiftly from the tree-clad slopes that \\nclimbed back westward towards the mountains. They heard it splashing over a \\nfall away among the shadows on their right. Its dark hurrying waters ran \\nacross the path before them, and joined the Silverlode in a swirl of dim \\npools among the roots of trees. \\n\\n\\'Here is Nimrodel! \\' said Legolas. \\'Of this stream the Silvan Elves \\nmade many songs long ago, and still we sing them in the North, remembering \\nthe rainbow on its falls, and the golden flowers that floated in its foam. \\n\\nAll is dark now and the Bridge of Nimrodel is broken down. I will bathe my \\nfeet, for it is said that the water is healing to the weary.\\' He went \\nforward and climbed down the deep-cloven bank and stepped into the stream. \\n\\n\\'Follow me!\\' he cried. \\'The water is not deep. Let us wade across! On \\nthe further bank we can rest, and the sound of the falling water may bring \\nus sleep and forgetfulness of grief.\\' \\n\\nOne by one they climbed down and followed Legolas. For a moment Frodo \\nstood near the brink and let the water flow over his tired feet. It was cold \\nbut its touch was clean, and as he went on and it mounted to his knees, he \\nfelt that the stain of travel and all weariness was washed from his limbs. \\n\\nWhen all the Company had crossed, they sat and rested and ate a little \\nfood; and Legolas told them tales of Lothlurien that the Elves of Mirkwood \\nstill kept in their hearts, of sunlight and starlight upon the meadows by \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe Great River before the world was grey. \\n\\nAt length a silence fell, and they heard the music of the waterfall \\nrunning sweetly in the shadows. Almost Frodo fancied that he could hear a \\nvoice singing, mingled with the sound of the water. \\n\\n\\'Do you hear the voice of Nimrodel? \\' asked Legolas. \\'I will sing you a \\nsong of the maiden Nimrodel, who bore the same name as the stream beside \\nwhich she lived lung ago. It is a fair song in our woodland tongue; but this \\nis how it runs in the Westron Speech, as some in Rivendell now sing it.\\' In \\na soft voice hardly to be heard amid the rustle of the leaves above them he \\nbegan: \\n\\nAn Elven-maid there was of old, \\n\\nA shining star by day: \\n\\nHer mantle white was hemmed with gold, \\n\\nHer shoes of silver-grey. \\n\\nA star was bound upon her brows, \\n\\nA light was on her hair \\nAs sun upon the golden boughs \\nIn Lurien the fair. \\n\\nHer hair was long, her limbs were white, \\n\\nAnd fair she was and free; \\n\\nAnd in the wind she went as light \\nAs leaf of linden-tree. \\n\\nBeside the falls of Nimrodel, \\n\\nBy water clear and cool, \\n\\nHer voice as falling silver fell \\nInto the shining pool. \\n\\nWhere now she wanders none can tell, \\n\\nIn sunlight or in shade; \\n\\nFor lost of yore was Nimrodel \\nAnd in the mountains strayed. \\n\\nThe elven-ship in haven grey \\nBeneath the mountain-lee \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAwaited her for many a day \\nBeside the roaring sea. \\n\\nA wind by night in Northern lands \\nArose, and loud it cried, \\n\\nAnd drove the ship from elven-strands \\nAcross the streaming tide. \\n\\nWhen dawn came dim the land was lost, \\nThe mountains sinking grey \\nBeyond the heaving waves that tossed \\nTheir plumes of blinding spray. \\n\\nAmroth beheld the fading shore \\nNow low beyond the swell, \\n\\nAnd cursed the faithless ship that bore \\nHim far from Nimrodel. \\n\\nOf old he was an Elven-king, \\n\\nA lord of tree and glen, \\n\\nWhen golden were the boughs in spring \\nIn fair Lothlurien. \\n\\nFrom helm to sea they saw him leap, \\n\\nAs arrow from the string, \\n\\nAnd dive into the water deep, \\n\\nAs mew upon the wing. \\n\\nThe wind was in his flowing hair, \\n\\nThe foam about him shone; \\n\\nAfar they saw him strong and fair \\nGo riding like a swan. \\n\\nBut from the West has come no word, \\nAnd on the Hither Shore \\nNo tidings Elven-folk have heard \\nOf Amroth evermore. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe voice of Legolas faltered, and the song ceased. \\'I cannot sing any \\nmore,\\' he said. \\'That is but a part, for I have forgotten much. It is long \\nand sad, for it tells how sorrow came upon Lothlurien, Lurien of the \\nBlossom, when the Dwarves awakened evil in the mountains.\\' \\n\\n\\'But the Dwarves did not make the evil,\\' said Gimli. \\n\\n\\'I said not so; yet evil came,\\' answered Legolas sadly. \\'Then many of \\nthe Elves of Nimrodel\\'s kindred left their dwellings and departed and she \\nwas lost far in the South, in the passes of the White Mountains; and she \\ncame not to the ship where Amroth her lover waited for her. But in the \\nspring when the wind is in the new leaves the echo of her voice may still be \\nheard by the falls that bear her name. And when the wind is in the South the \\nvoice of Amroth comes up from the sea; for Nimrodel flows into Silverlode, \\nthat Elves call Celebrant, and Celebrant into Anduin the Great, and Anduin \\nflows into the Bay of B elf alas whence the Elves of Lurien set sail. But \\nneither Nimrodel nor Amroth ever came back. \\n\\n\\'It is told that she had a house built in the branches of a tree that \\ngrew near the falls; for that was the custom of the Elves of Lurien, to \\ndwell in the trees, and maybe it is so still. Therefore they were called the \\nGaladhrim, the Tree -people. Deep in their forest the trees are very great. \\n\\nThe people of the woods did not delve in the ground like Dwarves, nor build \\nstrong places of stone before the Shadow came.\\' \\n\\n\\'And even in these latter days dwelling in the trees might be thought \\nsafer than sitting on the ground,\\' said Gimli. He looked across the stream \\nto the road that led back to Dimrill Dale, and then up into the roof of dark \\nboughs above. \\n\\n\\'Your words bring good counsel, Gimli,\\' said Aragorn. \\'We cannot build \\na house, but tonight we will do as the Galadhrim and seek refuge in the \\ntree-tops, if we can. We have sat here beside the road already longer than \\nwas wise.\\' \\n\\nThe Company now turned aside from the path, and went into the shadow of \\nthe deeper woods, westward along the mountain-stream away from \\nSilverlode. \\n\\nNot far from the falls of Nimrodel they found a cluster of trees, some of \\nwhich overhung the stream. Their great grey trunks were of mighty girth, but \\ntheir height could not be guessed. \\n\\n\\'I will climb up,\\' said Legolas. \\'I am at home among trees, by root or \\nbough, though these trees are of a kind strange to me, save as a name in \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsong. Mellyrn they are called, and are those that bear the yellow blossom, \\nbut I have never climbed in one. I will see now what is their shape and way \\nof growth.\\' \\n\\n\\'Whatever it may be,\\' said Pippin, \\'they will be marvellous trees \\nindeed if they can offer any rest at night, except to birds. I cannot sleep \\non a perch ! \\' \\n\\n\\'Then dig a hole in the ground,\\' said Legolas, \\'if that is more after \\nthe fashion of your kind. But you must dig swift and deep, if you wish to \\nhide from Ores.\\' He sprang lightly up from the ground and caught a branch \\nthat grew from the trunk high above his head. But even as he swung there for \\na moment, a voice spoke suddenly from the tree-shadows above him. \\n\\n\\' Daro !\\' it said in commanding tone, and Legolas dropped back to earth \\nin surprise and fear. He shrank against the bole of the tree. \\n\\n\\'Stand still! \\' he whispered to the others. \\'Do not move or speak! \\' \\n\\nThere was a sound of soft laughter over their heads, and then another \\nclear voice spoke in an elven-tongue. Frodo could understand little of what \\nwas said, for the speech that the Silvan folk east of the mountains used \\namong themselves was unlike that of the West. Legolas looked up and \\nanswered \\n\\nin the same language.* \\n\\n\\'Who are they, and what do they say? \\' asked Merry. \\n\\n\\'They\\'re Elves,\\' said Sam. \\'Can\\'t you hear their voices? \\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, they are Elves,\\' said Legolas; \\'and they say that you breathe so \\nloud that they could shoot you in the dark.\\' Sam hastily put his hand over \\nhis mouth. \\'But they say also that you need have no fear. They have been \\naware of us for a long while. They heard my voice across the Nimrodel, and \\nknew that I was one of their Northern kindred, and therefore they did not \\nhinder our crossing; and afterwards they heard my song. Now they bid me \\nclimb up with Frodo; for they seem to have had some tidings of him and of \\nour journey. The others they ask to wait a little and to keep watch at the \\nfoot of the tree, until they have decided what is to be done.\\' \\n\\nOut of the shadows a ladder was let down: it was made of rope, \\nsilver-grey and glimmering in the dark, and though it looked slender it \\nproved strong enough to bear many men. Legolas ran lightly up, and Frodo \\nfollowed slowly; behind came Sam trying not to breathe loudly. The branches \\nof the mallorn-tree grew out nearly straight from the trunk, and then swept \\nupward; but near the top the main stem divided into a crown of many boughs, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand among these they found that there had been built a wooden platform, or \\nflet as such things were called in those days: the Elves called it a talan. \\n\\nIt was reached by a round hole in the centre through which the ladder \\npassed. \\n\\nWhen Frodo came at last up on to the flet he found Legolas seated with \\nthree other Elves. They were clad in shadowy-grey, and could not be seen \\namong the tree-stems, unless they moved suddenly. They stood up, and one of \\nthem uncovered a small lamp that gave out a slender silver beam. He held it \\nup, looking at Frodo\\'s face, and Sam\\'s. Then he shut off the light again, \\nand spoke words of welcome in his elven-tongue. Frodo spoke haltingly in \\nreturn. \\n\\n\\'Welcome!\\' the Elf then said again in the Common Fanguage, speaking \\nslowly. \\'We seldom use any tongue but our own; for we dwell now in the heart \\nof the forest, and do not willingly have dealings with any other folk. Even \\nour own kindred in the North are sundered from us. But there are some of us \\nstill who go abroad for the gathering of news and the watching of our \\nenemies, and they speak the languages of other lands. I am one. Haldir is my \\nname. My brothers, R(r)mil and Orophin, speak little of your tongue. \\n\\n\\'But we have heard rumours of your coming, for the messengers of Elrond \\npassed by Furien on their way home up the Dimrill Stair. We had not heard of \\nhobbits, or halflings, for many a long year, and did not know that any yet \\ndwelt in Middle-earth. You do not look evil! And since you come with an Elf \\nof our kindred, we are willing to befriend you, as Elrond asked; though it \\nis not our custom to lead strangers through our land. But you must stay here \\ntonight. How many are you? \\' \\n\\n\\'Eight,\\' said Legolas. \\'Myself, four hobbits; and two men, one of whom, \\nAragorn, is an Elf-friend of the folk of Westernesse.\\' \\n\\n\\'The name of Aragorn son of Arathorn is known in Lurien,\\' said Haldir, \\n\\'and he has the favour of the Lady. All then is well. But you have yet \\nspoken only of seven.\\' \\n\\n\\'The eighth is a dwarf,\\' said Legolas. \\n\\n\\'A dwarf! \\' said Haldir. \\'That is not well. We have not had dealings \\nwith the Dwarves since the Dark Days. They are not permitted in our land. I \\ncannot allow him to pass.\\' \\n\\n\\'But he is from the Lonely Mountain, one of Dbin\\'s trusty people, and \\nfriendly to Elrond,\\' said Frodo. \\'Elrond himself chose him to be one of our \\ncompanions, and he has been brave and faithful.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Elves spoke together in soft voices, and questioned Legolas in \\ntheir own tongue. \\'Very good,\\' said Haldir at last. \\'We will do this, though \\nit is against our liking. If Aragorn and Legolas will guard him, and answer \\nfor him, he shall pass; but he must go blindfold through Lothlurien. \\n\\n\\'But now we must debate no longer. Your folk must not remain on the \\nground. We have been keeping watch on the rivers, ever since we saw a great \\ntroop of Ores going north toward Moria, along the skirts of the mountains, \\nmany days ago. Wolves are howling on the wood\\'s borders. If you have indeed \\ncome from Moria, the peril cannot be far behind. Tomorrow early you must go \\non. \\n\\n\\'The four hobbits shall climb up here and stay with us- we do not fear \\nthem! There is another ta Ian in the next tree. There the others must take \\nrefuge. You, Legolas, must answer to us for them. Call us, if anything is \\namiss! And have an eye on that dwarf!\\' \\n\\nLegolas at once went down the ladder to take Haldir\\'s message; and soon \\nafterwards Merry and Pippin clambered up on to the high flet. They were out \\nof breath and seemed rather scared. \\n\\n\\'There!\\' said Merry panting. \\'We have lugged up your blankets as well \\nas our own. Strider has hidden all the rest of the baggage in a deep drift \\nof leaves.\\' \\n\\n\\'You had no need of your burdens,\\' said Haldir. \\'It is cold in the \\ntree-tops in winter, though the wind tonight is in the South; but we have \\nfood and drink to give you that will drive away the night-chill, and we have \\nskins and cloaks to spare.\\' \\n\\nThe hobbits accepted this second (and far better) supper very gladly. \\n\\nThen they wrapped themselves warmly, not only in the fur-cloaks of the \\nElves, but in their own blankets as well, and tried to go to sleep. But \\nweary as they were only Sam found that easy to do. Hobbits do not like \\nheights, and do not sleep upstairs, even when they have any stairs. The flet \\nwas not at all to their liking as a bedroom. It had no walls, not even a \\nrail; only on one side was there a light plaited screen, which could be \\nmoved and fixed in different places according to the wind. \\n\\nPippin went on talking for a while. \\'I hope, if I do go to sleep in \\nthis bed-loft, that I shan\\'t roll off,\\' he said. \\n\\n\\'Once I do get to sleep,\\' said Sam, \\'i shall go on sleeping, whether I \\nroll off or no. And the less said, the sooner I\\'ll drop off, if you take my \\nmeaning.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrodo lay for some time awake, and looked up at the stars glinting \\nthrough the pale roof of quivering leaves. Sam was snoring at his side long \\nbefore he himself closed his eyes. He could dimly see the grey forms of two \\nelves sitting motionless with their arms about their knees, speaking in \\nwhispers. The other had gone down to take up his watch on one of the lower \\nbranches. At last lulled by the wind in the boughs above, and the sweet \\nmurmur of the falls of Nimrodel below, Frodo fell asleep with the song of \\nLegolas running in his mind. \\n\\nLate in the night he awoke. The other hobbits were asleep. The Elves \\nwere gone. The sickle Moon was gleaming dimly among the leaves. The wind \\nwas \\n\\nstill. A little way off he heard a harsh laugh and the tread of many feet on \\nthe ground below. There was a ring of metal. The sounds died slowly away, \\nand seemed to go southward, on into the wood. \\n\\nA head appeared suddenly through the hole in the flet. Frodo sat up in \\nalarm and saw that it was a grey-hooded Elf. He looked towards the hobbits. \\n\\n\\'What is it? \\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\' Yrch !\\' said the Elf in a hissing whisper, and cast on to the flet the \\nrope-ladder rolled up. \\n\\n\\'Ores! \\' said Frodo. \\'What are they doing? \\' But the Elf had gone. \\n\\nThere were no more sounds. Even the leaves were silent, and the very \\nfalls seemed to be hushed. Frodo sat and shivered in his wraps. He was \\nthankful that they had not been caught on the ground; but he felt that the \\ntrees offered little protection, except concealment. Ores were as keen as \\nhounds on a scent, it was said, but they could also climb. He drew out \\nSting: it flashed and glittered like a blue flame and then slowly faded \\nagain and grew dull. In spite of the fading of his sword the feeling of \\nimmediate danger did not leave Frodo, rather it grew stronger. He got up and \\ncrawled to the opening and peered down. He was almost certain that he could \\nhear stealthy movements at the tree\\'s foot far below. \\n\\nNot Elves; for the woodland folk were altogether noiseless in their \\nmovements. Then he heard faintly a sound like sniffing: and something seemed \\nto be scrabbling on the bark of the tree-trunk. He stared down into the \\ndark, holding his breath. \\n\\nSomething was now climbing slowly, and its breath came like a soft \\nhissing through closed teeth. Then coming up, close to the stem, Frodo saw \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntwo pale eyes. They stopped and gazed upward unwinking. Suddenly they \\nturned \\n\\naway, and a shadowy figure slipped round the trunk of the tree and vanished. \\n\\nImmediately afterwards Haldir came climbing swiftly up through the \\nbranches. \\'There was something in this tree that I have never seen before,\\' \\nhe said. \\'It was not an ore. It fled as soon as I touched the tree -stem. It \\nseemed to be wary, and to have some skill in trees, or I might have thought \\nthat it was one of you hobbits. \\n\\nI did not shoot, for I dared not arouse any cries: we cannot risk \\nbattle. A strong company of Ores has passed. They crossed the Nimrodel-curse \\ntheir foul feet in its clean water! -and went on down the old road beside the \\nriver. They seemed to pick up some scent, and they searched the ground for a \\nwhile near the place where you halted. The three of us could not challenge a \\nhundred, so we went ahead and spoke with feigned voices, leading them on \\ninto the wood. \\n\\n\\'Orophin has now gone in haste back to our dwellings to warn our \\npeople. None of the Ores will ever return out of Lurien. And there will be \\nmany Elves hidden on the northern border before another night falls. But you \\nmust take the road south as soon as it is fully light.\\' \\n\\nDay came pale from the East. As the light grew it filtered through the \\nyellow leaves of the mallorn, and it seemed to the hobbits that the early \\nsun of a cool summer\\'s morning was shining. Pale-blue sky peeped among the \\nmoving branches. Looking through an opening on the south side of the flet \\nFrodo saw all the valley of the Silverlode lying like a sea of fallow gold \\ntossing gently in the breeze. \\n\\nThe morning was still young and cold when the Company set out again, \\nguided now by Haldir and his brother R(r)mil. \\'Farewell, sweet Nimrodel! \\' \\ncried Legolas. Frodo looked back and caught a gleam of white foam among \\nthe \\n\\ngrey tree-stems. \\'Farewell,\\' he said. It seemed to him that he would never \\nhear again a running water so beautiful, for ever blending its innumerable \\nnotes in an endless changeful music. \\n\\nThey went back to the path that still went on along the west side of \\nthe Silverlode, and for some way they followed it southward. There were the \\nprints of ore-feet in the earth. But soon Haldir turned aside into the trees \\nand halted on the bank of the river under their shadows. \\n\\n\\'There is one of my people yonder across the stream,\\' he said \\'though \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyou may not see him.\\' He gave a call like the low whistle of a bird, and out \\nof a thicket of young trees an Elf stepped, clad in grey, but with his hood \\nthrown back; his hair glinted like gold in the morning sun. Haldir skilfully \\ncast over the stream a coil of grey rope, and he caught it and bound the end \\nabout a tree near the bank. \\n\\n\\'Celebrant is already a strong stream here, as you see,\\' said Haldir \\n\\'and it runs both swift and deep, and is very cold. We do not set foot in it \\nso far north, unless we must. But in these days of watchfulness we do not \\nmake bridges. This is how we cross! Follow me!\\' He made his end of the rope \\nfast about another tree, and then ran lightly along it, over the river and \\nback again, as if he were on a road. \\n\\nV I can walk this path,\\' said Legolas; \\'but the others have not this \\nskill. Must they swim?\\' \\n\\n\\'No!\\' said Haldir. \\'We have two more ropes. We will fasten them above \\nthe other, one shoulder-high, and another half-high, and holding these the \\nstrangers should be able to cross with care.\\' \\n\\nWhen this slender bridge had been made, the Company passed over, some \\ncautiously and slowly, others more easily. Of the hobbits Pippin proved the \\nbest for he was sure-footed, and he walked over quickly, holding only with \\none hand; but he kept his eyes on the bank ahead and did not look down. Sam \\nshuffled along, clutching hard, and looking down into the pale eddying water \\nas if it was a chasm in the mountains. \\n\\nHe breathed with relief when he was safely across. \\'Live and learn! as \\nmy gaffer used to say. Though he was thinking of gardening, not of roosting \\nlike a bird, nor of trying to walk like a spider. Not even my uncle Andy \\never did a trick like that! \\' \\n\\nWhen at length all the Company was gathered on the east bank of the \\nSilverlode, the Elves untied the ropes and coiled two of them. R(r)mil, who \\nhad remained on the other side, drew back the last one, slung it on his \\nshoulder, and with a wave of his hand went away, back to Nimrodel to keep \\nwatch. \\n\\n\\'Now, friends,\\' said Haldir, \\'you have entered the Naith of Lurien or \\nthe Gore, as you would say, for it is the land that lies like a spear -head \\nbetween the arms of Silverlode and Anduin the Great. We allow no strangers \\nto spy out the secrets of the Naith. Few indeed are permitted even to set \\nfoot there. \\n\\n\\'As was agreed, I shall here blindfold the eyes of Gimli the Dwarf. The \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nother may walk free for a while, until we come nearer to our dwellings, down \\nin Egladil, in the Angle between the waters.\\' \\n\\nThis was not at all to the liking of Gimli. \\'The agreement was made \\nwithout my consent,\\' he said. \\'I will not walk blindfold, like a beggar or a \\nprisoner. And I am no spy. My folk have never had dealings with any of the \\nservants of the Enemy. Neither have we done harm to the Elves. I am no more \\nlikely to betray you than Legolas, or any other of my companions.\\' \\n\\n\\'I do not doubt you,\\' said Haldir. \\'Yet this is our law. I am not the \\nmaster of the law, and cannot set it aside. I have done much in letting you \\nset foot over Celebrant.\\' \\n\\nGimli was obstinate. He planted his feet firmly apart, and laid his \\nhand upon the haft of his axe. \\'I will go forward free,\\' he said, \\'or I will \\ngo back and seek my own land, where I am known to be true of word, though I \\nperish alone in the wilderness.\\' \\n\\n\\'You cannot go back,\\' said Haldir sternly. \\'Now you have come thus far, \\nyou must be brought before the Lord and the Lady. They shall judge you, to \\nhold you or to give you leave, as they will. You cannot cross the rivers \\nagain, and behind you there are now secret sentinels that you cannot pass. \\n\\nYou would be slain before you saw them.\\' \\n\\nGimli drew his axe from his belt. Haldir and his companion bent their \\nbows. \\'A plague on Dwarves and their stiff necks! \\' said Legolas. \\n\\n\\'Come!\\' said Aragorn. \\'If I am still to lead this Company, you must do \\nas I bid. It is hard upon the Dwarf to be thus singled out. We will all be \\nblindfold, even Legolas. That will be best, though it will make the journey \\nslow and dull.\\' \\n\\nGimli laughed suddenly. \\'A merry troop of fools we shall look! Will \\nHaldir lead us all on a string, like many blind beggars with one dog? But I \\nwill be content, if only Legolas here shares my blindness.\\' \\n\\n\\'I am an Elf and a kinsman here,\\' said Legolas, becoming angry in his \\nturn. \\n\\n\\'Now let us cry: \"a plague on the stiff necks of Elves!\"\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\n\\'But the Company shall all fare alike. Come, bind our eyes Haldir! \\' \\n\\n\\'I shall claim full amends for every fall and stubbed toe, if you do \\nnot lead us well,\\' said Gimli as they bound a cloth about his eyes. \\n\\n\\'You will have no claim,\\' said Haldir. \\'I shall lead you well, and the \\npaths are smooth and straight.\\' \\n\\n\\'Alas for the folly of these days! \\' said Legolas. \\'Here all are \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nenemies of the one Enemy, and yet I must walk blind, while the sun is merry \\nin the woodland under leaves of gold! \\' \\n\\n\\'Folly it may seem,\\' said Haldir. \\'Indeed in nothing is the power of \\nthe Dark Lord more clearly shown than in the estrangement that divides all \\nthose who still oppose him. Yet so little faith and trust do we find now in \\nthe world beyond Lothlurien, unless maybe in Rivendell, that we dare not by \\nour own trust endanger our land. We live now upon an island amid many \\nperils, and our hands are more often upon the bowstring than upon the harp. \\n\\n\\'The rivers long defended us, but they are a sure guard no more for the \\nShadow has crept northward all about us. Some speak of departing, yet for \\nthat it already seems too late. The mountains to the west are growing evil; \\nto the east the lands are waste, and full of Sauron\\'s creatures; and it is \\nrumoured that we cannot now safely pass southward through Rohan, and the \\nmouths of the Great River are watched by the Enemy. Even if we could come \\nto \\n\\nthe shores of the Sea, we should find no longer any shelter there. It is \\nsaid that there are still havens of. the High Elves, but they are far north \\nand west, beyond the land of the Halflings. But where that may be, though \\nthe Lord and Lady may know, I do not.\\' \\n\\n\\'You ought at least to guess, since you have seen us,\\' said Merry. \\n\\n\\'There are Elf-havens west of my land, the Shire where Hobbits live.\\' \\n\\n\\'Happy folk are Hobbits to dwell near the shores of the sea! \\' said \\nHaldir. \\'It is long indeed since any of my folk have looked on it, yet still \\nwe remember it in song. Tell me of these havens as we walk.\\' \\n\\n\\'I cannot,\\' said Merry. \\'I have never seen them. I have never been out \\nof my own land before. And if I had known what the world outside was like. I \\ndon\\'t think I should have had the heart to leave it.\\' \\n\\n\\'Not even to see fair Lothlurien? \\' said Haldir. \\'The world is indeed \\nfull of peril, and in it there are many dark places; but still there is much \\nthat is fair, and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief, it \\ngrows perhaps the greater. \\n\\n\\'Some there are among us who sing that the Shadow will draw back and \\npeace shall come again. Yet I do not believe that the world about us will \\never again be as it was of old, or the light of the Sun as it was aforetime. \\n\\nFor the Elves, I fear, it will prove at best a truce, in which they may pass \\nto the Sea unhindered and leave the Middle-earth for ever. Alas for \\nLothlurien that I love! It would be a poor life in a land where no mallorn \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngrew. But if there are mallorn-trees beyond the Great Sea, none have \\nreported it.\\' \\n\\nAs they spoke thus, the Company filed slowly along the paths in the \\nwood, led by Haldir, while the other Elf walked behind. They felt the ground \\nbeneath their feet smooth and soft, and after a while they walked more \\nfreely, without fear of hurt or fall. Being deprived of sight, Frodo found \\nhis hearing and other senses sharpened. He could smell the trees and the \\ntrodden grass. He could hear many different notes in the rustle of the \\nleaves overhead, the river murmuring away on his right, and the thin clear \\nvoices of birds in the sky. He felt the sun upon his face and hands when \\nthey passed through an open glade. \\n\\nAs soon as he set foot upon the far bank of Silverlode a strange \\nfeeling had come upon him, and it deepened as he walked on into the Naith: \\nit seemed to him that he had stepped over a bridge of time into a corner of \\nthe Elder Days, and was -now walking in a world that was no more. In \\nRivendell there was memory of ancient things; in Lurien the ancient things \\nstill lived on in the waking world. Evil had been seen and heard there, \\nsorrow had been known; the Elves feared and distrusted the world outside: \\nwolves were howling on the wood\\'s borders: but on the land of Lurien no \\nshadow lay. \\n\\nAll that day the Company marched on, until they felt the cool evening \\ncome and heard the early night- wind whispering among many leaves. Then \\nthey \\n\\nrested and slept without fear upon the ground; for their guides would not \\npermit them to unbind their eyes, and they could not climb. In the morning \\nthey went on again, walking without haste. At noon they halted, and Frodo \\nwas aware that they had passed out under the shining Sun. Suddenly he heard \\nthe sound of many voices all around him. \\n\\nA marching host of Elves had come up silently: they were hastening \\ntoward the northern borders to guard against any attack from Moria; and they \\nbrought news, some of which Haldir reported. The marauding ores had been \\nwaylaid and almost all destroyed; the remnant had fled westward towards the \\nmountains, and were being pursued. A strange creature also had been seen, \\nrunning with bent back and with hands near the ground, like a beast and yet \\nnotofbeast-shape.lt had eluded capture, and they had not shot it, not \\nknowing whether it was good or ill, and it had vanished down the Silverlode \\nsouthward. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Also,\\' said Haldir, \"they bring me a message from the Lord and Lady of \\nthe Galadhrim. You are all to walk free, even the dwarf Gimli. It seems that \\nthe Lady knows who and what is each member of your Company. New \\nmessages \\n\\nhave come from Rivendell perhaps.\\' \\n\\nHe removed the bandage first from Gimli\\' s eyes. \\'Your pardon! \\' he \\nsaid, bowing low. \"Look on us now with friendly eyes! Look and be glad, for \\nyou are the first dwarf to behold the trees of the Naith of Lurien since \\nDurin\\'s Day! \\' \\n\\nWhen his eyes were in turn uncovered, Frodo looked up and caught his \\nbreath. They were standing in an open space. To the left stood a great \\nmound, covered with a sward of grass as green as Spring-time in the Elder \\nDays. Upon it, as a double crown, grew two circles of trees: the outer had \\nbark of snowy white, and were leafless but beautiful in their shapely \\nnakedness; the inner were mallorn-trees of great height, still arrayed in \\npale gold. High amid the branches of a towering tree that stood in the \\ncentre of all there gleamed a white flet. At the feet of the trees, and all \\nabout the green hillsides the grass was studded with small golden flowers \\nshaped like stars. Among them, nodding on slender stalks, were other \\nflowers, white and palest green: they glimmered as a mist amid the rich hue \\nof the grass. Over all the sky was blue, and the sun of afternoon glowed \\nupon the hill and cast long green shadows beneath the trees. \\n\\n\\'Behold! You are come to Cerin Amroth,\\' said Haldir. \"For this is the \\nheart of the ancient realm as it was long ago, and here is the mound of \\nAmroth, where in happier days his high house was built. Here ever bloom the \\nwinter flowers in the unfading grass: the yellow elanor, and the pale \\nniphredil. Here we will stay awhile, and come to the city of the Galadhrim \\nat dusk.\\' \\n\\nThe others cast themselves down upon the fragrant grass, but Frodo \\nstood awhile still lost in wonder. It seemed to him that he had stepped \\nthrough a high window that looked on a vanished world. A light was upon it \\nfor which his language had no name. All that he saw was shapely, but the \\nshapes seemed at once clear cut, as if they had been first conceived and \\ndrawn at the uncovering of his eyes, and ancient as if they had endured for \\never. He saw no colour but those he knew, gold and white and blue and green, \\nbut they were fresh and poignant, as if he had at that moment first \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nperceived them and made for them names new and wonderful. In winter here \\nno \\n\\nheart could mourn for summer or for spring. No blemish or sickness or \\ndeformity could be seen in anything that grew upon the earth. On the land of \\nLurien there was no stain. \\n\\nHe turned and saw that Sam was now standing beside him, looking round \\nwith a puzzled expression, and rubbing his eyes as if he was not sure that \\nhe was awake. \\'It\\'s sunlight and bright day, right enough,\\' he said. \\'I \\nthought that Elves were all for moon and stars: but this is more elvish than \\nanything I ever heard tell of. I feel as if I was inside a song, if you take \\nmy meaning.\\' \\n\\nHaldir looked at them, and he seemed indeed to take the meaning of both \\nthought and word. He smiled. \\'You feel the power of the Lady of the \\nGaladhrim,\\' he said. \\'Would it please you to climb with me up Cerin Amroth? \\n\\nf \\n\\nThey followed him as he stepped lightly up the grass-clad slopes. \\nThough he walked and breathed, and about him living leaves and flowers were \\nstirred by the same cool wind as fanned his face, Frodo felt that he was in \\na timeless land that did not fade or change or fall into forgetfulness. When \\nhe had gone and passed again into the outer world, still Frodo the wanderer \\nfrom the Shire would walk there, upon the grass among elanor and niphredil \\nin fair Lothlurien. \\n\\nThey entered the circle of white trees. As they did so the South Wind \\nblew upon Cerin Amroth and sighed among the branches. Frodo stood still, \\nhearing far off_ great seas upon beaches that had long ago been washed away, \\nand sea-birds crying whose race had perished from the earth. \\n\\nHaldir had gone on and was now climbing to the high flet. As Frodo \\nprepared to follow him, he laid his hand upon the tree beside the ladder: \\nnever before had he been so suddenly and so keenly aware of the feel and \\ntexture of a tree\\'s skin and of the life within it. He felt a delight in \\nwood and the touch of it, neither as forester nor as carpenter; it was the \\ndelight of the living tree itself. \\n\\nAs he stepped out at last upon the lofty platform, Haldir took his hand \\nand turned him toward the South. \\'Look this way first! \\' he said. \\n\\nFrodo looked and saw, still at some distance, a hill of many mighty \\ntrees, or a city of green towers: which it was he could not tell. Out of it, \\nit seemed to him that the power and light came that held all the land in \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsway. He longed suddenly to fly like a bird to rest in the green city. Then \\nhe looked eastward and saw all the land of Lurien running down to the pale \\ngleam of Anduin, the Great River. He lifted his eyes across the river and \\nall the light went out, and he was back again in the world he knew. Beyond \\nthe river the land appeared flat and empty, formless and vague, until far \\naway it rose again like a wall, dark and drear. The sun that lay on \\nLothlurien had no power to enlighten the shadow of that distant height. \\n\\n\\'There lies the fastness of Southern Mirkwood,\\' said Haldir. \\'It is \\nclad in a forest of dark fir, where the trees strive one against another and \\ntheir branches rot and wither. In the midst upon a stony height stands Dol \\nGuldur, where long the hidden Enemy had his dwelling. We fear that now it is \\ninhabited again, and with power sevenfold. A black cloud lies often over it \\nof late. In this high place you may see the two powers that are opposed one \\nto another; and ever they strive now in thought, but whereas the light \\nperceives the very heart of the darkness, its own secret has not been \\ndiscovered. Not yet.\\' He turned and climbed swiftly down, and they followed \\nhim. \\n\\nAt the hill\\'s foot Frodo found Aragorn, standing still and silent as a \\ntree; but in his hand was a small golden bloom of elanor, and a light was in \\nhis eyes. He was wrapped in some fair memory: and as Frodo looked at him he \\nknew that he beheld things as they once had been in this same place. For the \\ngrim years were removed from the face of Aragorn, and he seemed clothed in \\nwhite, a young lord tall and fair; and he spoke words in the Elvish tongue \\nto one whom Frodo could not see. Arwen vanimelda, nambril! he said, and then \\nhe drew a breath, and returning out of his thought he looked at Frodo and \\nsmiled. \\n\\n\\'Here is the heart of Elvendom on earth,\\' he said, \\'and here my heart \\ndwells ever, unless there be a light beyond the dark roads that we still \\nmust tread, you and I. Come with me! \\' And taking Frodo\\'s hand in his, he \\nleft the hill of Cerin Amroth and came there never again as living man. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 7 . The Mirror of Galadriel \\n\\n\\n\\nThe sun was sinking behind the mountains, and the shadows were \\ndeepening in the woods, when they went on again. Their paths now went into \\nthickets where the dusk had already gathered. Night came beneath the trees \\nas they walked, and the Elves uncovered their silver lamps. \\n\\nSuddenly they came out into the open again and found themselves under a \\npale evening sky pricked by a few early stars. There was a wide treeless \\nspace before them, running in a great circle and bending away on either \\nhand. Beyond it was a deep fosse lost in soft shadow, but the grass upon its \\nbrink was green, as if it glowed still in memory of the sun that had gone. \\nUpon the further side there rose to a great height a green wall encircling a \\ngreen hill thronged with mallorn-trees taller than any they had yet seen in \\nall the land. Their height could not be guessed, but they stood up in the \\ntwilight like living towers. In their, many -tiered branches and amid their \\never-moving leaves countless lights were gleaming, green and gold and \\nsilver. Haldir turned towards the Company. \\n\\n\\'Welcome to Caras Galadhon! \\' he said. \\'Here is the city of the \\nGaladhrim where dwell the Lord Celeborn and Galadriel the Lady of Lurien. \\nBut we cannot enter here, for the gates do not look northward. We must go \\nround to the southern side, and the way is not short, for the city is \\ngreat.\\' \\n\\nThere was a road paved with white stone running on the outer brink of \\nthe fosse. Along this they went westward, with the city ever climbing up \\nlike a green cloud upon their left; and as the night deepened more lights \\nsprang forth, until all the hill seemed afire with stars. They came at last \\nto a white bridge, and crossing found the great gates of the city: they \\nfaced south-west, set between the ends of the encircling wall that here \\noverlapped, and they were tall and strong, and hung with many lamps. \\n\\nHaldir knocked and spoke, and the gates opened soundlessly; but of \\nguards Lrodo could see no sign. The travellers passed within, and the gates \\nshut behind them. They were in a deep lane between the ends of the wall, and \\npassing quickly through it they entered the City of the Trees. No folk could \\nthey see, nor hear any feet upon the paths; but there were many voices, \\nabout them, and in the air above. Ear away up on the hill they could hear \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe sound of singing falling from on high like soft rain upon leaves. \\n\\nThey went along many paths and climbed many stairs, until they came to \\nthe high places and saw before them amid a wide lawn a fountain shimmering. \\nIt was lit by silver lamps that swung from the boughs of trees, and it fell \\ninto a basin of silver, from which a white stream spilled. Upon the south \\nside of the lawn there stood the mightiest of all the trees; its great \\nsmooth bole gleamed like grey silk, and up it towered, until its first \\nbranches, far above, opened their huge limbs under shadowy clouds of leaves. \\nBeside it a broad white ladder stood, and at its foot three Elves were \\nseated. They sprang up as the travellers approached, and Frodo saw that they \\nwere tall and clad in grey mail, and from their shoulders hung long white \\ncloaks. \\n\\n\\'Here dwell Celeborn and Galadriel,\\' said Haldir. v It is their wish \\nthat you should ascend and speak with them.\\' \\n\\nOne of the Elf-wardens then blew a clear note on a small horn, and it \\nwas answered three times from far above. V I will go first,\\' said Haldir. \\n\\n\\'Let Frodo come next and with him Legolas. The others may follow as they \\nwish. It is a long climb for those that are not accustomed to such stairs, \\nbut you may rest upon the way.\\' \\n\\nAs he climbed slowly up Frodo passed many flets: some on one side, some \\non another, and some set about the bole of the tree, so that the ladder \\npassed through them. At a great height above the ground he came to a wide \\ntalan, like the deck of a great ship. On it was built a house, so large that \\nalmost it would have served for a hall of Men upon the earth. He entered \\nbehind Haldir, and found that he was in a chamber of oval shape, in the \\nmidst of which grew the trunk of the great mallorn, now tapering towards its \\ncrown, and yet making still a pillar of wide girth. \\n\\nThe chamber was filled with a soft light; its walls were green and \\nsilver and its roof of gold. Many Elves were seated there. On two chairs \\nbeneath the bole of the tree and canopied by a living bough there sat, side \\nby side, Celeborn and Galadriel. They stood up to greet their guests, after \\nthe manner of Elves, even those who were accounted mighty kings. Very tall \\nthey were, and the Lady no less tall than the Lord; and they were grave and \\nbeautiful. They were clad wholly in white; and the hair of the Lady was of \\ndeep gold, and the hair of the Lord Celeborn was of silver long and bright; \\nbut no sign of age was upon them, unless it were in the depths of their \\neyes; for these were keen as lances in the starlight, and yet profound, the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwells of deep memory. \\n\\nHaldir led Frodo before them, and the Lord welcomed him in his own \\ntongue. The Lady Galadriel said no word but looked long upon his face. \\n\\n\\'Sit now beside my chair, Frodo of the Shire! \\' said Celeborn. \\'When \\nall have come we will speak together.\\' \\n\\nEach of the companions he greeted courteously by name as they entered. \\n\\'Welcome Aragorn son of Arathorn! \\' he said. \\'It is eight and thirty years \\nof the world outside since you came to this land; and those years lie heavy \\non you. But the end is near, for good or ill. Here lay aside your burden for \\na while ! \\' \\n\\n\\'Welcome son of Thranduil! Too seldom do my kindred journey hither from \\nthe North.\\' \\n\\n\\'Welcome Gimli son of Gluin! It is long indeed since we saw one of \\nDurin\\'s folk in Caras Galadhon. But today we have broken our long law. May \\nit be a sign that though the world is now dark better days are at hand, and \\nthat friendship shall be renewed between our peoples.\\' Gimli bowed low. \\n\\nWhen all the guests were seated before his chair the Lord looked at \\nthem again. \\'Here there are eight,\\' he said. \\'Nine were to set out: so said \\nthe messages. But maybe there has been some change of counsel that we have \\nnot heard. Elrond is far away, and darkness gathers between us, and all this \\nyear the shadows have grown longer.\\' \\n\\n\\'Nay, there was no change of counsel,\\' said the Lady Galadriel speaking \\nfor the first time. Her voice was clear and musical, but deeper than woman\\'s \\nwont. \\'Gandalf the Grey set out with the Company, but he did not pass the \\nborders of this land. Now tell us where he is; for I much desired to speak \\nwith him again. But I cannot see him from afar, unless he comes within the \\nfences of Lothlurien: a grey mist is about him, and the ways of his feet and \\nof his mind are hidden from me.\\' \\n\\n\\'Alas! \\' said Aragorn. \\'Gandalf the Grey fell into shadow. He remained \\nin Moria and did not escape.\\' \\n\\nAt these words all the Elves in the hall cried aloud in grief and \\namazement. \\'These are evil tidings,\\' said Celeborn, \\'the most evil that have \\nbeen spoken here in long years full of grievous deeds.\\' He turned to Haldir. \\n\\'Why has nothing of this been told to me before? \\' he asked in the \\nElven-tongue. \\n\\n\\'We have not spoken to Haldir of our deeds or our purpose,\\' said \\nLegolas. \\'At first we were weary and danger was too close behind and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nafterwards we almost forgot our grief for a time, as we walked in gladness \\non the fair paths of Lurien.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yet our grief is great and our loss cannot be mended,\\' said Frodo. \\n\\'Gandalf was our guide, and he led us through Moria; and when our escape \\nseemed beyond hope he saved us, and he fell.\\' \\n\\nTell us now the full tale! \\' said Celeborn: \\n\\nThen Aragorn recounted all that had happened upon the pass of \\nCaradhras, and in the days that followed; and he spoke of Balin and his \\nbook, and the fight in the Chamber of Mazarbul, and the fire, and the narrow \\nbridge, and the coming of the Terror. \\'An evil of the Ancient World it \\nseemed, such as I have never seen before,\\' said Aragorn. \\'It was both a \\nshadow and a flame, strong and terrible.\\' \\n\\n\\'It was a Balrog of Morgoth,\\' said Legolas; \\'of all elf-banes the most \\ndeadly, save the One who sits in the Dark Tower.\\' \\n\\n\\'Indeed I saw upon the bridge that which haunts our darkest dreams 1 \\nsaw Durin\\'s Bane,\\' said Gimli in a low voice, and dread was in his eyes. \\n\\n\\'Alas! \\' said Celeborn. \\'We long have feared that under Caradhras a \\nterror slept. But had I known that the Dwarves had stirred up this evil in \\nMoria again, 1 would have forbidden you to pass the northern borders, you \\nand all that went with you. And if it were possible, one would say that at \\nthe last Gandalf fell from wisdom into folly, going needlessly into the net \\nof Moria.\\' \\n\\n\\'He would be rash indeed that said that thing,\\' said Galadriel gravely. \\n\\'Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life. Those that followed him \\nknew not his mind and cannot report his full purpose. But however it may be \\nwith the guide, the followers are blameless. Do not repent of your welcome \\nto the Dwarf. If our folk had been exiled long and far from Lothlurien, who \\nof the Galadhrim, even Celeborn the Wise, would pass nigh and would not \\nwish \\n\\nto look upon their ancient home, though it had become an abode of dragons? \\n\\n\\'Dark is the water of Kheled-zvram, and cold are the springs of \\nKibil-nvla, and fair were the many -pillared halls of Khazad-dym in Elder \\nDays before the fall of mighty kings beneath the stone.\\' She looked upon \\nGimli, who sat glowering and sad, and she smiled. And the Dwarf, hearing the \\nnames given in his own ancient tongue, looked up and met her eyes; and it \\nseemed to him that he looked suddenly into the heart of an enemy and saw \\nthere love and understanding. Wonder came into his face, and then he smiled \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nin answer. \\n\\nHe rose clumsily and bowed in dwarf-fashion, saying: \\'Yet more fair is \\nthe living land of Lurien, and the Lady Galadriel is above all the jewels \\nthat lie beneath the earth! \\' \\n\\nThere was a silence. At length Celeborn spoke again. \\'I did not know \\nthat your plight was so evil,\\' he said. \\'Let Gimli forget my harsh words: I \\nspoke in the trouble of my heart. I will do what I can to aid you, each \\naccording to his wish and need, but especially that one of the little folk \\nwho bears the burden.\\' \\n\\n\\'Your quest is known to us,\\' said Galadriel, looking at Frodo. \\'But we \\nwill not here speak of it more openly. Yet not in vain will it prove, maybe, \\nthat you came to this land seeking aid, as Gandalf himself plainly purposed. \\nFor the Lord of the Galadhrim is accounted the wisest of the Elves of \\nMiddle-earth, and a giver of gifts beyond the power of kings. He has dwelt \\nin the West since the days of dawn, and I have dwelt with him years \\nuncounted; for ere the fall of Nargothrond or Gondolin I passed over the \\nmountains, and together through ages of the world we have fought the long \\ndefeat. \\n\\n\\'I it was who first summoned the White Council. And if my designs had \\nnot gone amiss, it would have been governed by Gandalf the Grey, and then \\nmayhap things would have gone otherwise. But even now there is hope left. I \\nwill not give you counsel, saying do this, or do that. For not in doing or \\ncontriving, nor in choosing between this course and another, can I avail; \\nbut only in knowing what was and is, and in part also what shall be. But \\nthis I will say to you: your Quest stands upon the edge of a knife. Stray \\nbut a little and it will fail, to the ruin of all. Yet hope remains while \\nall the Company is true.\\' \\n\\nAnd with that word she held them with her eyes, and in silence looked \\nsearchingly at each of them in turn. None save Legolas and Aragorn could \\nlong endure her glance. Sam quickly blushed and hung his head. \\n\\nAt length the Lady Galadriel released them from her eyes, and she \\nsmiled. \\'Do not let your hearts be troubled,\\' she said. \\'Tonight you shall \\nsleep in peace.\\' Then they sighed and felt suddenly weary, as those who have \\nbeen questioned long and deeply, though no words had been spoken openly. \\n\\n\\'Go now! \\' said Celeborn. \\'You are worn with sorrow and much toil. Even \\nif your Quest did not concern us closely, you should have refuge in this \\nCity, until you were healed and refreshed. Now you shall rest, and we will \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnot speak of your further road for a while.\\' \\n\\nThat night the Company slept upon the ground, much to the satisfaction \\nof the hobbits. The Elves spread for them a pavilion among the trees near \\nthe fountain, and in it they laid soft couches; then speaking words of peace \\nwith fair elvish voices they left them. For a little while the travellers \\ntalked of their night before in the tree-tops, and of their day\\'s journey, \\nand of the Lord and Lady; for they had not yet the heart to look further \\nback. \\n\\n\\'What did you blush for, Sam? \\' said Pippin. \\'You soon broke down. \\nAnyone would have thought you had a guilty conscience. I hope it was nothing \\nworse than a wicked plot to steal one of my blankets.\\' \\n\\n\\'I never thought no such thing,\\' answered Sam, in no mood for jest. \\'If \\nyou want to know, I felt as if I hadn\\'t got nothing on, and I didn\\'t like \\nit. She seemed to be looking inside me and asking me what I would do if she \\ngave me the chance of flying back home to the Shire to a nice little hole \\nwith-with a bit of garden of my own.\\' \\n\\n\\'That\\'s funny,\\' said Merry. \\'Almost exactly what I felt myself; only, \\nonly well, I don\\'t think I\\'ll say any more,\\' he ended lamely. \\n\\nAll of them, it seemed, had fared alike: each had felt that he was \\noffered a choice between a shadow full of fear that lay ahead, and something \\nthat he greatly desired: clear before his mind it lay, and to get it he had \\nonly to turn aside from the road and leave the Quest and the war against \\nSauron to others. \\n\\n\\'And it seemed to me, too,\\' said Gimli, \\'that my choice would remain \\nsecret and known only to myself.\\' \\n\\n\\'To me it seemed exceedingly strange,\\' said Boromir. \\'Maybe it was only \\na test, and she thought to read our thoughts for her own good purpose; but \\nalmost I should have said that she was tempting us, and offering what she \\npretended to have the power to give. It need not be said that I refused to \\nlisten. The Men of Minas Tirith are true to their word.\\' But what he thought \\nthat the Lady had offered him Boromir did not tell. \\n\\nAnd as for Frodo, he would not speak, though Boromir pressed him with \\nquestions. \\'She held you long in her gaze, Ring -bearer,\\' he said. \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Frodo; \\'but whatever came into my mind then I will keep \\nthere.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, have a care! \\'said Boromir. \\'I do not feel too sure of this \\nElvish Lady and her purposes.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Speak no evil of the Lady Galadriel! \\' said Aragorn sternly. \\'You know \\nnot what you say. There is in her and in this land no evil, unless a man \\nbring it hither himself . Then let him beware ! But tonight I shall sleep \\nwithout fear for the first time since I left Rivendell. And may I sleep \\ndeep, and forget for a while my grief! I am weary in body and in heart.\\' He \\ncast himself down upon his couch and fell at once into a long sleep. \\n\\nThe others soon did the same, and no sound or dream disturbed their \\nslumber. When they woke they found that the light of day was broad upon the \\nlawn before the pavilion, and the fountain rose and fell glittering in the \\nsun. \\n\\nThey remained some days in Lothlurien, so far as they could tell or \\nremember. All the while that they dwelt there the sun shone clear, save for \\na gentle rain that fell at times, and passed away leaving all things fresh \\nand clean. The air was cool and soft, as if it were early spring, yet they \\nfelt about them the deep and thoughtful quiet of winter. It seemed to them \\nthat they did little but eat and drink and rest, and walk among the trees; \\nand it was enough. \\n\\nThey had not seen the Lord and Lady again, and they had little speech \\nwith the Elven-folk; for few of these knew or would use the Westron tongue. \\nHaldir had bidden them farewell and gone back again to the fences of the \\nNorth, where great watch was now kept since the tidings of Moria that the \\nCompany had brought. Legolas was away much among the Galadhrim, and \\nafter \\n\\nthe first night he did not sleep with the other companions, though he \\nreturned to eat and talk with them. Often he took Gimli with him when he \\nwent abroad in the land, and the others wondered at this change. \\n\\nNow as the companions sat or walked together they spoke of Gandalf, and \\nall that each had known and seen of him came clear before their minds. As \\nthey were healed of hurt and weariness of body the grief of their loss grew \\nmore keen. Often they heard nearby Elvish voices singing, and knew that they \\nwere making songs of lamentation for his fall, for they caught his name \\namong the sweet sad words that they could not understand. \\n\\nMithrandir, Mithrandir sang the Elves, O Pilgrim Grey! For so they \\nloved to call him. But if Legolas was with the Company, he would not \\ninterpret the songs for them, saying that he had not the skill, and that for \\nhim the grief was still too near, a matter for tears and not yet for song. \\n\\nIt was Frodo who first put something of his sorrow into halting words. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe was seldom moved to make song or rhyme; even in Ri vendell he had \\nlistened \\n\\nand had not sung himself, though his memory was stored with many things that \\nothers had made before him. But now as he sat beside the fountain in Lurien \\nand heard about him the voices of the Elves, his thought took shape in a \\nsong that seemed fair to him; yet when he tried to repeat it to Sam only \\nsnatches remained, faded as a handful of withered leaves. \\n\\nWhen evening in the Shire was grey \\nhis footsteps on the Hill were heard; \\nbefore the dawn he went away \\non journey long without a word. \\n\\nFrom Wilderland to Western shore, \\nfrom northern waste to southern hill, \\nthrough dragon-lair and hidden door \\nand darkling woods he walked at will. \\n\\nWith Dwarf and Hobbit, Elves and Men, \\nwith mortal and immortal folk, \\nwith bird on bough and beast in den, \\nin their own secret tongues he spoke. \\n\\nA deadly sword, a healing hand, \\na back that bent beneath its load; \\na trumpet-voice, a burning brand, \\na weary pilgrim on the road. \\n\\nA lord of wisdom throned he sat, \\nswift in anger, quick to laugh; \\nan old man in a battered hat \\nwho leaned upon a thorny staff. \\n\\nHe stood upon the bridge alone \\nand Fire and Shadow both defied; \\nhis staff was broken on the stone, \\nin Khazad-dym his wisdom died. \\n\\n\\'Why, you\\'ll be beating Mr. Bilbo next! \\' said Sam. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'No, I am afraid not,\\' said Frodo. \\'But that is the best I can do yet.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, Mr. Frodo, if you do have another go, I hope you\\'ll say a word \\nabout his fireworks,\\' said Sam. \\'Something like this: \\n\\nThe finest rockets ever seen: \\nthey burst in stars of blue and green, \\nor after thunder golden showers \\ncame falling like a rain of flowers. \\n\\nThough that doesn\\'t do them justice by a long road.\\' \\n\\n\\'No, I\\'ll leave that to you, Sam. Or perhaps to Bilbo. But-well. I \\ncan\\'t talk of it any more. I can\\'t bear to think of bringing the news to \\nhim.\\' \\n\\nOne evening Frodo and Sam were walking together in the cool twilight. \\nBoth of them felt restless again. On Frodo suddenly the shadow of parting \\nhad fallen: he knew somehow that the time was very near when he must leave \\nLothlurien. \\n\\n\\'What do you think of Elves now, Sam? \\' he said. \\'I asked you the same \\nquestion once before-it seems a very long while ago; but you have seen more \\nof them since then.\\' \\n\\n\\'I have indeed! \\' said Sam. \\'And I reckon there\\'s Elves and Elves. \\n\\nThey\\'re all elvish enough, but they\\'re not all the same. Now these folk \\naren\\'t wanderers or homeless, and seem a bit nearer to the likes of us: they \\nseem to belong here, more even than Flobbits do in the Shire. Whether they\\'ve \\nmade the land, or the land\\'s made them, it\\'s hard to say, if you take my \\nmeaning. It\\'s wonderfully quiet here. Nothing seems to be going on, and \\nnobody seems to want it to. If there\\'s any magic about, it\\'s right down \\ndeep, where I can\\'t lay my hands on it, in a manner of speaking.\\' \\n\\n\\'You can see and feel it everywhere,\\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'Well,\\' said Sam, \\'you can\\'t see nobody working it. No fireworks like \\npoor Gandalf used to show. I wonder we don\\'t see nothing of the Lord and \\nLady in all these days. I fancy now that she could do some wonderful things, \\nif she had a mind. I\\'d dearly love to see some Elf-magic, Mr. Frodo! \\' \\n\\n\\'I wouldn\\'t,\\' said Frodo. \\'I am content. And I don\\'t miss Gandalf\\'s \\nfireworks, but his bushy eyebrows, and his quick temper, and his voice.\\' \\n\\n\\'You\\'re right,\\' said Sam. \\'And don\\'t think I\\'m finding fault. I\\'ve \\noften wanted to see a bit of magic like what it tells of in old tales, but \\nI\\'ve never heard of a better land than this. It\\'s like being at home and on \\na holiday at the same time, if you understand me. I don\\'t want to leave. All \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe same, I\\'m beginning to feel that if we\\'ve got to go on, then we\\'d best \\nget it over. \\n\\n\\'It\\'s the job that\\'s never started as takes longest to finish, as my \\nold gaffer used to say. And I don\\'t reckon that these folk can do much more \\nto help us, magic or no. It\\'s when we leave this land that we shall miss \\nGandalf worse, I\\'m thinking.\\' \\n\\n\\'I am afraid that\\'s only too true, Sam,\\' said Frodo. \\'Yet I hope very \\nmuch that before we leave we shall see the Lady of the Elves again.\\' \\n\\nEven as he spoke, they saw, as if she came in answer to their words, \\nthe Lady Galadriel approaching. Tall and white and fair she walked beneath \\nthe trees. She spoke no word, but beckoned to them. \\n\\nTurning aside, she led them toward the southern slopes of the hill of \\nCaras Galadhon, and passing through a high green hedge they came into an \\nenclosed garden. No trees grew there, and it lay open to the sky. The \\nevening star had risen and was shining with white fire above the western \\nwoods. Down a long flight of steps the Lady went into a deep green hollow, \\nthrough which ran murmuring the silver stream that issued from the fountain \\non the hill. At the bottom, upon a low pedestal carved like a branching \\ntree, stood a basin of silver, wide and shallow, and beside it stood a \\nsilver ewer. \\n\\nWith water from the stream Galadriel filled the basin to the brim, and \\nbreathed on it, and when the water was still again she spoke. \\'Here is the \\nMirror of Galadriel,\\' she said. \\'I have brought you here so that you may \\nlook in it, if you will.\\' \\n\\nThe air was very still, and the dell was dark, and the Elf-lady beside \\nhim was tall and pale. \\'What shall we look for, and what shall we see? \\' \\nasked Frodo, filled with awe. \\n\\n\\'Many things I can command the Mirror to reveal,\\' she answered, \\'and to \\nsome I can show what they desire to see. But the Mirror will also show \\nthings unbidden, and those are often stranger and more profitable than \\nthings which we wish to behold. What you will see, if you leave the Mirror \\nfree to work, I cannot tell. For it shows things that were, and things that \\nare, things that yet may be. But which it is that he sees, even the wisest \\ncannot always tell. Do you wish to look? \\' \\n\\nFrodo did not answer. \\n\\n\\'And you? \\' she said, turning to Sam. \\'For this is what your folk would \\ncall magic. I believe; though I do not understand clearly what they mean; \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand they seem also to use the same word of the deceits of the Enemy. But \\nthis, if you will, is the magic of Galadriel. Did you not say that you \\nwished to see Elf-magic? \\' \\n\\n\\'I did,\\' said Sam, trembling a little between fear and curiosity. Til \\nhave a peep, Lady, if you\\'re willing.\\' \\n\\n\\'And I\\'d not mind a glimpse of what\\'s going on at home,\\' he said in an \\naside to Frodo. \\'It seems a terrible long time that I\\'ve been away. But \\nthere, like as not I\\'ll only see the stars, or something that I won\\'t \\nunderstand.\\' \\n\\n\\'Like as not,\\' said the Lady with a gentle laugh. \\'But come, you shall \\nlook and see what you may. Do not touch the water! \\' \\n\\nSam climbed up on the foot of the pedestal and leaned over the basin. \\n\\nThe water looked hard and dark. Stars were reflected in it. \\n\\n\\'There\\'s only stars, as I thought,\\' he said. Then he gave a low gasp, \\nfor the stars went out. As if a dark veil had been withdrawn, the Mirror \\ngrew grey, and then clear. There was sun shining, and the branches of trees \\nwere waving and tossing in the wind. But before Sam could make up his mind \\nwhat it was that he saw, the light faded; and now he thought he saw Frodo \\nwith a pale face lying fast asleep under a great dark cliff. Then he seemed \\nto see himself going along a dim passage, and climbing an endless winding \\nstair. It came to him suddenly that he was looking urgently for something, \\nbut what it was he did not know. Like a dream the vision shifted and went \\nback, and he saw the trees again. But this time they were not so close, and \\nhe could see what was going on: they were not waving in the wind, they were \\nfalling, crashing to the ground. \\n\\n\\'Hi!\\' cried Sam in an outraged voice. \\'There\\'s that Ted Sandyman \\na-cutting down trees as he shouldn\\'t. They didn\\'t ought to be felled: it\\'s \\nthat avenue beyond the Mill that shades the road to Bywater. I wish I could \\nget at Ted, and I\\'d fell himV \\n\\nBut now Sam noticed that the Old Mill had vanished, and a large \\nred-brick building was being put up where it had stood. Lots of folk were \\nbusily at work. There was a tall red chimney nearby. Black smoke seemed to \\ncloud the surface of the Mirror. \\n\\n\\'There\\'s some devilry at work in the Shire,\\' he said. \\'Elrond knew what \\nhe was about when he wanted to send Mr. Merry back.\\' Then suddenly Sam \\ngave \\n\\na cry and sprang away. \\'I can\\'t stay here,\\' he said wildly. \\'I must go home. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThey\\'ve dug up Bagshot Row, and there\\'s the poor old gaffer going down the \\nHill with his bits of things on a barrow. I must go home! \\' \\n\\n\\'You cannot go home alone,\\' said the Lady. \\'You did not wish to go home \\nwithout your master before you looked in the Mirror, and yet you knew that \\nevil things might well be happening in the Shire. Remember that the Mirror \\nshows many things, and not all have yet come to pass. Some never come to be, \\nunless those that behold the visions turn aside from their path to prevent \\nthem. The Mirror is dangerous as a guide of deeds.\\' \\n\\nSam sat on the ground and put his head in his hands. \\'I wish I had \\nnever come here, and I don\\'t want to see no more magic,\\' he said and fell \\nsilent. After a moment he spoke again thickly, as if struggling with tears. \\n\\n\\'No, I\\'ll go home by the long road with Mr. Frodo, or not at all,\\' he said. \\n\\n\\'But I hope I do get back some day. If what I\\'ve seen turns out true, \\nsomebody\\'s going to catch it hot! \\' \\n\\n\\'Do you now wish to look, Frodo? \\' said the Lady Galadriel. \\'You did \\nnot wish to see Elf-magic and were content.\\' \\n\\n\\'Do you advise me to look? \\' asked Frodo. \\n\\n\\'No,\\' she said. \\'I do not counsel you one way or the other. I am not a \\ncounsellor. You may learn something, and whether what you see be fair or \\nevil, that may be profitable, and yet it may not. Seeing is both good and \\nperilous. Yet I think, Frodo, that you have courage and wisdom enough for \\nthe venture, or I would not have brought you here. Do as you will! \\' \\n\\n\\'I will look,\\' said Frodo, and he climbed on the pedestal and bent over \\nthe dark water. At once the Mirror cleared and he saw a twilit land. \\nMountains loomed dark in the distance against a pale sky. A long grey road \\nwound back out of sight. Far away a figure came slowly down the road, faint \\nand small at first, but growing larger and clearer as it approached. \\nSuddenly Frodo realized that it reminded him of Gandalf. He almost called \\naloud the wizard\\'s name, and then he saw that the figure was clothed not in \\ngrey but in white, in a white that shone faintly in the dusk; and in its \\nhand there was a white staff. The head was so bowed that he could see no \\nface, and presently the figure turned aside round a bend in the road and \\nwent out of the Mirror\\'s view. Doubt came into Frodo\\'s mind: was this a \\nvision of Gandalf on one of his many lonely journeys long ago, or was it \\nSaruman? \\n\\nThe vision now changed. Brief and small but very vivid he caught a \\nglimpse of Bilbo walking restlessly about his room. The table was littered \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwith disordered papers; rain was beating on the windows. \\n\\nThen there was a pause, and after it many swift scenes followed that \\nFrodo in some way knew to be parts of a great history in which he had become \\ninvolved. The mist cleared and he saw a sight which he had never seen before \\nbut knew at once: the Sea. Darkness fell. The sea rose and raged in a great \\nstorm. Then he saw against the Sun, sinking blood-red into a wrack of \\nclouds, the black outline of a tall ship with torn sails riding up out of \\nthe West. Then a wide river flowing through a populous city. Then a white \\nfortress with seven towers. And then again a ship with black sails, but now \\nit was morning again, and the water rippled with light, and a banner bearing \\nthe emblem of a white tree shone in the sun. A smoke as of fire and battle \\narose, and again the sun went down in a burning red that faded into a grey \\nmist; and into the mist a small ship passed away, twinkling with lights. It \\nvanished, and Frodo sighed and prepared to draw away. \\n\\nBut suddenly the Mirror went altogether dark, as dark as if a hole had \\nopened in the world of sight, and Frodo looked into emptiness. In the black \\nabyss there appeared a single Eye that slowly grew, until it filled nearly \\nall the Mirror. So terrible was it that Frodo stood rooted, unable to cry \\nout or to withdraw his gaze. The Eye was rimmed with fire, but was itself \\nglazed, yellow as a cat\\'s, watchful and intent, and the black slit of its \\npupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing. \\n\\nThen the Eye began to rove, searching this way and that; and Frodo knew \\nwith certainty and horror that among the many things that it sought he \\nhimself was one. But he also knew that it could not see him-not yet, not \\nunless he willed it. The Ring that hung upon its chain about his neck grew \\nheavy, heavier than a great stone, and his head was dragged downwards. The \\nMirror seemed to be growing hot and curls of steam were rising from the \\nwater. He was slipping forward. \\n\\n\\'Do not touch the water!\\' said the Lady Galadriel softly. The vision \\nfaded, and Frodo found that he was looking at the cool stars twinkling in \\nthe silver basin. He stepped back shaking all over and looked at the Lady. \\n\\nV I know what it was that you last saw,\\' she said; \\'for that is also in \\nmy mind. Do not be afraid! But do not think that only by singing amid the \\ntrees, nor even by the slender arrows of elven-bows, is this land of \\nLothlurien maintained and defended against its Enemy. I say to you, Frodo, \\nthat even as I speak to you, I perceive the Dark Lord and know his mind, or \\nall of his mind that concerns the Elves. And he gropes ever to see me and my \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthought. But still the door is closed! \\' \\n\\nShe lifted up her white arms, and spread out her hands towards the East \\nin a gesture of rejection and denial. Edrendil, the Evening Star, most \\nbeloved of the Elves, shone clear above. So bright was it that the figure of \\nthe Elven-lady cast a dim shadow on the ground. Its rays glanced upon a ring \\nabout her finger; it glittered like polished gold overlaid with silver \\nlight, and a white stone in it twinkled as if the Even-star had come down to \\nrest upon her hand. Frodo gazed at the ring with awe; for suddenly it seemed \\nto him that he understood. \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' she said, divining his thought, \\'it is not permitted to speak of \\nit, and Elrond could not do so. But it cannot be hidden from the \\nRing -bearer, and one who has seen the Eye. Verily it is in the land of \\nLurien upon the finger of Galadriel that one of the Three remains. This is \\nNenya, the Ring of Adamant, and I am its keeper. \\n\\n\\'He suspects, but he does not know -- not yet. Do you not see now \\nwherefore your coming is to us as the footstep of Doom? For if you fail, \\nthen we are laid bare to the Enemy. Yet if you succeed, then our power is \\ndiminished, and Lothlurien will fade, and the tides of Time will sweep it \\naway. We must depart into the West, or dwindle to a rustic folk of dell and \\ncave, slowly to forget and to be forgotten.\\' \\n\\nFrodo bent his head. \\'And what do you wish? \\' he said at last. \\n\\n\\'That what should be shall be,\\' she answered. \\'The love of the Elves \\nfor their land and their works is deeper than the deeps of the Sea, and \\ntheir regret is undying and cannot ever wholly be assuaged. Yet they will \\ncast all away rather than submit to Sauron: for they know him now. For the \\nfate of Lothlurien you are not answerable but only for the doing of your own \\ntask. Yet I could wish, were it of any avail, that the One Ring had never \\nbeen wrought, or had remained for ever lost.\\' \\n\\n\\'You are wise and fearless and fair, Lady Galadriel,\\' said Frodo. \\'I \\nwill give you the One Ring, if you ask for it. It is too great a matter for \\nme.\\' \\n\\nGaladriel laughed with a sudden clear laugh. \\'Wise the Lady Galadriel \\nmay be,\\' she said, \\'yet here she has met her match in courtesy. Gently are \\nyou revenged for my testing of your heart at our first meeting. You begin to \\nsee with a keen eye. I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired to ask \\nwhat you offer. For many long years I had pondered what I might do, should \\nthe Great Ring come into my hands, and behold! it was brought within my \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngrasp. The evil that was devised long ago works on in many ways, whether \\nSauron himself stands or falls. Would not that have been a noble deed to set \\nto the credit of his Ring, if I had taken it by force or fear from my guest? \\n\\n\\'And now at last it comes. You will give me the Ring freely! In place \\nof the Dark Lord you will set up a Queen. And I shall not be dark, but \\nbeautiful and terrible as the Morning and the Night! Fair as the Sea and the \\nSun and the Snow upon the Mountain! Dreadful as the Storm and the \\nLightning ! \\n\\nStronger than the foundations of the earth. All shall love me and despair! \\' \\n\\nShe lifted up her hand and from the ring that she wore there issued a \\ngreat light that illuminated her alone and left all else dark. She stood \\nbefore Frodo seeming now tall beyond measurement, and beautiful beyond \\nenduring, terrible and worshipful. Then she let her hand fall, and the light \\nfaded, and suddenly she laughed again, and lo! she was shrunken: a slender \\nelf-woman, clad in simple white, whose gentle voice was soft and sad. \\n\\n\\'I pass the test,\\' she said. \\'I will diminish, and go into the West and \\nremain Galadriel.\\' \\n\\nThey stood for a long while in silence. At length the Lady spoke again. \\n\\n\\'Let us return! \\' she said. \\'In the morning you must depart for now we have \\nchosen, and the tides of fate are flowing.\\' \\n\\n\\'I would ask one thing before we go,\\' said Frodo, \\'a thing which I \\noften meant to ask Gandalf in Rivendell. I am permitted to wear the One \\nRing: why cannot I see all the others and know the thoughts of those that \\nwear them? \\' \\n\\n\\'You have not tried,\\' she said. \\'Only thrice have you set the Ring upon \\nyour finger since you knew what you possessed. Do not try! It would destroy \\nyou. Did not Gandalf tell you that the rings give power according to the \\nmeasure of each possessor? Before you could use that power you would need \\nto \\n\\nbecome far stronger, and to train your will to the domination of others. Yet \\neven so, as Ring-bearer and as one that has borne it on finger and seen that \\nwhich is hidden, your sight is grown keener. You have perceived my thought \\nmore clearly than many that are accounted wise. You saw the Eye of him that \\nholds the Seven and the Nine. And did you not see and recognize the ring \\nupon my finger? Did you see my ring? \\' she asked turning again to Sam. \\n\\n\\'No, Lady,\\' he answered. \\'To tell you the truth, I wondered what you \\nwere talking about. I saw a star through your finger. But if you\\'ll pardon \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmy speaking out, I think my master was right. I wish you\\'d take his Ring. \\nYou\\'d put things to rights. You\\'d stop them digging up the gaffer and \\nturning him adrift. You\\'d make some folk pay for their dirty work.\\' \\n\\n\\'I would,\\' she said. \\'That is how it would begin. But it would not stop \\nwith that, alas! We will not speak more of it. Let us go!\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 8 . Farewell to Lurien \\n\\n\\n\\nThat night the Company was again summoned to the chamber of Celeborn, \\nand there the Lord and Lady greeted them with fair words. At length Celeborn \\nspoke of their departure. \\n\\n\\'Now is the time,\\' he said, \\'when those who wish to continue the Quest \\nmust harden their hearts to leave this land. Those who no longer wish to go \\nforward may remain here, for a while. But whether they stay or go, none can \\nbe sure of peace. For we are come now to the edge of doom. Here those who \\nwish may await the oncoming of the hour till either the ways of the world \\nlie open again, or we summon them to the last need of Lurien. Then they may \\nreturn to their own lands, or else go to the long home of those that fall in \\nbattle.\\' \\n\\nThere was a silence. \\'They all resolved to go forward,\\' said Galadriel \\nlooking in their eyes. \\n\\n\\'As for me,\\' said Boromir, \\'my way home lies onward and not back.\\' \\n\\n\\'That is true,\\' said Celeborn, \\'but is all this Company going with you \\nto Minas Tirith? \\' \\n\\n\\'We have not decided our course,\\' said Aragorn. \\'Beyond Lothlurien I do \\nnot know what Gandalf intended to do. Indeed I do not think that even he had \\nany clear purpose.\\' \\n\\n\\'Maybe not,\\' said Celeborn, \\'yet when you leave this land, you can no \\nlonger forget the Great River. As some of you know well, it cannot be \\ncrossed by travellers with baggage between Lurien and Gondor, save by boat. \\nAnd are not the bridges of Osgiliath broken down and all the landings held \\nnow by the Enemy? \\n\\n\\'On which side will you journey? The way to Minas Tirith lies upon this \\nside, upon the west; but the straight road of the Quest lies east of the \\nRiver, upon the darker shore. Which shore will you now take? \\' \\n\\n\\'If my advice is heeded, it will be the western shore, and the way to \\nMinas Tirith,\\' answered Boromir. \\'But I am not the leader of the Company.\\' \\nThe others said nothing, and Aragorn looked doubtful and troubled. \\n\\n\\'I see that you do not yet know what to do,\\' said Celeborn. \\'It is not \\nmy part to choose for you; but I will help you as I may. There are some \\n\\n\\n\\n\\namong you who can handle boats: Legolas, whose folk know the swift Forest \\nRiver; and Boromir of Gondor; and Aragorn the traveller.\\' \\n\\n\\'And one Hobbit! \\' cried Merry. \\'Not all of us look on boats as wild \\nhorses. My people live by the banks of the Brandywine.\\' \\n\\n\\'That is well,\\' said Celeborn. \\'Then I will furnish your Company with \\nboats. They must be small and light, for if you go far by water, there are \\nplaces where you will be forced to carry them. You will come to the rapids \\nof Sarn Gebir, and maybe at last to the great falls of Rauros where the \\nRiver thunders down from Nen Hithoel; and there are other perils. Boats may \\nmake your journey less toilsome for awhile. Yet they will not give you \\ncounsel: in the end you must leave them and the River, and turn west-or \\neast.\\' \\n\\nAragorn thanked Celeborn many times. The gift of boats comforted him \\nmuch, not least because there would now be no need to decide his course for \\nsome days. The others, too, looked more hopeful. Whatever perils lay ahead, \\nit seemed better to float down the broad tide of Anduin to meet them than to \\nplod forward with bent backs. Only Sam was doubtful: he at any rate still \\nthought boats as bad as wild horses, or worse, and not all the dangers that \\nhe had survived made him think better of them. \\n\\n\\'All shall be prepared for you and await you at the haven before noon \\ntomorrow,\\' said Celeborn. \\'I will send my people to you in the morning to \\nhelp you make ready for the journey. Now we will wish you all a fair night \\nand untroubled sleep.\\' \\n\\n\\'Good night, my friends! \\' said Galadriel. \\'Sleep in peace! Do not \\ntrouble your hearts overmuch with thought of the road tonight. Maybe the \\npaths that you each shall tread are already laid before your feet, though \\nyou do not see them. Good night! \\' \\n\\nThe Company now took their leave and returned to their pavilion. \\nLegolas went with them, for this was to be their last night in Lothlurien, \\nand in spite of the words of Galadriel they wished to take counsel together. \\n\\nFor a long time they debated what they should do, and how it would be \\nbest to attempt the fulfilling of their purpose with the Ring: but they came \\nto no decision. It was plain that most of them desired to go first to Minas \\nTirith, and to escape at least for a while from the terror of the Enemy. \\n\\nThey would have been willing to follow a leader over the River and into the \\nshadow of Mordor; but Frodo spoke no word, and Aragorn was still divided in \\nhis mind. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHis own plan, while Gandalf remained with them, had been to go with \\nBoromir, and with his sword help to deliver Gondor. For he believed that the \\nmessage of the dreams was a summons, and that the hour had come at last \\nwhen \\n\\nthe heir of Elendil should come forth and strive with Sauron for the \\nmastery. But in Moria the burden of Gandalf had been laid on him; and he \\nknew that he could not now forsake the Ring, if Frodo refused in the end to \\ngo with Boromir. And yet what help could he or any of the Company give to \\nFrodo, save to walk blindly with him into the darkness? \\n\\n\\'I shall go to Minas Tirith, alone if need be, for it is my duty,\\' said \\nBoromir; and after that he was silent for a while, sitting with his eyes \\nfixed on Frodo, as if he was trying to read the Halfling\\'s thoughts. At \\nlength he spoke again, softly, as if he was debating with himself. \\'If you \\nwish only to destroy the Ring,\\' he said, \"then there is little use in war \\nand weapons; and the Men of Minas Tirith cannot help. But if you wish to \\ndestroy the armed might of the Dark Lord, then it is folly to go without \\nforce into his domain; and folly to throw away.\\' He paused suddenly, as if \\nhe had become aware that he was speaking his thoughts aloud. \\'It would be \\nfolly to throw lives away, I mean,\\' he ended. \\'It is a choice between \\ndefending a strong place and walking openly into the arms of death. At \\nleast, that is how I see it.\\' \\n\\nFrodo caught something new and strange in Boromir\\'s glance, and he \\nlooked hard at him. Plainly Boromir\\'s thought was different from his final \\nwords. It would be folly to throw away: what? The Ring of Power? He had said \\nsomething like this at the Council, but then he had accepted the correction \\nof Elrond. Frodo looked at Aragorn, but he seemed deep in his own thought \\nand made no sign that he had heeded Boromir\\'s words. And so their debate \\nended. Merry and Pippin were already asleep, and Sam was nodding. The \\nnight \\n\\nwas growing old. \\n\\nIn the morning, as they were beginning to pack their slender goods, \\n\\nElves that could speak their tongue came to them and brought them many gifts \\nof food and clothing for the journey. The food was mostly in the form of \\nvery thin cakes, made of a meal that was baked a light brown on the outside, \\nand inside was the colour of cream. Gimli took up one of the cakes and \\nlooked at it with a doubtful eye. \\n\\n\\'Cram,\\' he said under his breath, as he broke off a crisp corner and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnibbled at it. His expression quickly changed, and he ate all the rest of \\nthe cake with relish. \\n\\n\\'No more, no more!\\' cried the Elves laughing. \\'You have eaten enough \\nalready for a long day\\'s march.\\' \\n\\n\\'I thought it was only a kind of cram , such as the Dale-men make for \\njourneys in the wild,\\' said the Dwarf. \\n\\n\\'So it is,\\' they answered. \\'But we call it lembas or waybread, and it \\nis more strengthening than any food made by Men, and it is more pleasant \\nthan cram, by all accounts.\\' \\n\\n\\'Indeed it is,\\' said Gimli. \\'Why it is better than the honey-cakes of \\nthe Beornings, and that is great praise, for the Beornings are the best \\nbakers that I know of; but they are none too willing to deal out their cakes \\nto travellers in these days. You are kindly hosts! \\' \\n\\n\\'All the same, we bid you spare the food,\\' they said. \\'Eat little at a \\ntime, and only at need. For these things are given to serve you when all \\nelse fails. The cakes will keep sweet for many many days, if they are \\nunbroken and left in their leaf- wrappings, as we have brought them. One will \\nkeep a traveller on his feet for a day of long labour, even if he be one of \\nthe tall Men of Minas Tirith.\\' \\n\\nThe Elves next unwrapped and gave to each of the Company the clothes \\nthey had brought. For each they had provided a hood and cloak, made \\naccording to his size, of the light but warm silken stuff that the Galadhrim \\nwove. It was hard to say of what colour they were: grey with the hue of \\ntwilight under the trees they seemed to be; and yet if they were moved, or \\nset in another light, they were green as shadowed leaves, or brown as fallow \\nfields by night, dusk-silver as water under the stars. Each cloak was \\nfastened about the neck with a brooch like a green leaf veined with silver. \\n\\n\\'Are these magic cloaks? \\' asked Pippin, looking at them with wonder. \\n\\n\\'I do not know what you mean by that,\\' answered the leader of the \\nElves. \\'They are fair garments, and the web is good, for it was made in this \\nland. They are elvish robes certainly, if that is what you mean. Leaf and \\nbranch, water and stone: they have the hue and beauty of all these things \\nunder the twilight of Lurien that we love; for we put the thought of all \\nthat we love into all that we make. Yet they are garments, not armour, and \\nthey will not turn shaft or blade. But they should serve you well: they are \\nlight to wear, and warm enough or cool enough at need. And you will find \\nthem a great aid in keeping out of the sight of unfriendly eyes, whether you \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwalk among the stones or the trees. You are indeed high in the favour of the \\nLady! For she herself and her maidens wove this stuff; and never before have \\nwe clad strangers in the garb of our own people.\\' \\n\\nAfter their morning meal the Company said farewell to the lawn by the \\nfountain. Their hearts were heavy; for it was a fair place, and it had \\nbecome like home to them, though they could not count the days and nights \\nthat they had passed there. As they stood for a moment looking at the white \\nwater in the sunlight, Haldir came walking towards them over the green grass \\nof the glade. Frodo greeted him with delight. \\n\\n\\'I have returned from the Northern Fences,\\' said the Elf, \\'and I am \\nsent now to be your guide again. The Dimrill Dale is full of vapour and \\nclouds of smoke, and the mountains are troubled. There are noises in the \\ndeeps of the earth. If any of you had thought of returning northwards to \\nyour homes, you would not have been able to pass that way. But come! Your \\npath now goes south.\\' \\n\\nAs they walked through Caras Galadhon the green ways were empty; but in \\nthe trees above them many voices were murmuring and singing. They \\nthemselves \\n\\nwent silently. At last Haldir led them down the southward slopes of the \\nhill, and they came again to the great gate hung with lamps, and to the \\nwhite bridge; and so they passed out and left the city of the Elves. Then \\nthey turned away from the paved road and took a path that went off into a \\ndeep thicket of mallorn-trees, and passed on, winding through rolling \\nwoodlands of silver shadow, leading them ever down, southwards and \\neastwards, towards the shores of the River. \\n\\nThey had gone some ten miles and noon was at hand when they came on a \\nhigh green wall. Passing through an opening they came suddenly out of the \\ntrees. Before them lay a long lawn of shining grass, studded with golden \\nelanor that glinted in the sun. The lawn ran out into a narrow tongue \\nbetween bright margins: on the right and west the Silverlode flowed \\nglittering; on the left and east the Great River rolled its broad waters, \\ndeep and dark. On the further shores the woodlands still marched on \\nsouthwards as far as the eye could see, but all the banks were bleak and \\nbare. No mallorn lifted its gold-hung boughs beyond the Land of Lurien. \\n\\nOn the bank of the Silverlode, at some distance up from the meeting of \\nthe streams, there was a hythe of white stones and white wood. By it were \\nmoored many boats and barges. Some were brightly painted, and shone with \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsilver and gold and green, but most were either white or grey. Three small \\ngrey boats had been made ready for the travellers, and in these the Elves \\nstowed their goods. And they added also coils of rope, three to each boat. \\nSlender they looked, but strong, silken to the touch, grey of hue like the \\nelven-cloaks. \\n\\n\\'What are these? \\' asked Sam, handling one that lay upon the \\ngreensward. \\n\\n\\'Ropes indeed! \\' answered an Elf from the boats. \\'Never travel far \\nwithout a rope! And one that is long and strong and light. Such are these. \\nThey may be a help in many needs.\\' \\n\\n\\'You don\\'t need to tell me that! \\' said Sam. I came without any and \\nI\\'ve been worried ever since. But I was wondering what these were made of, \\nknowing a bit about rope -making: it\\'s in the family as you might say.\\' \\n\\n\\'They are made of hithlain,\\' said the Elf, \\'but there is no time now to \\ninstruct you in the art of their making. Had we known that this craft \\ndelighted you, we could have taught you much. But now alas! unless you \\nshould at some time return hither, you must be content with our gift. May it \\nserve you well ! \\' \\n\\n\\'Come! \\' said Haldir. \\'All is now ready for you. Enter the boats! But \\ntake care at first! \\' \\n\\n\\'Heed the words! \\' said the other Elves. \\'These boats are light-built, \\nand they are crafty and unlike the boats of other folk. They will not sink, \\nlade them as you will; but they are wayward if mishandled. It would be wise \\nif you accustomed yourselves to stepping in and out, here where there is a \\nlanding-place, before you set off downstream.\\' \\n\\nThe Company was arranged in this way: Aragorn, Frodo, and Sam were in \\none boat; Boromir, Merry, and Pippin in another; and in the third were \\nLegolas and Gimli, who had now become fast friends. In this last boat most \\nof the goods and packs were stowed. The boats were moved and steered with \\nshort-handled paddles that had broad leaf-shaped blades. When all was ready \\nAragorn led them on a trial up the Silverlode. The current was swift and \\nthey went forward slowly. Sam sat in the bows, clutching the sides, and \\nlooking back wistfully to the shore. The sunlight glittering on the water \\ndazzled his eyes. As they passed beyond the green field of the Tongue, the \\ntrees drew down to the river\\'s brink. Here and there golden leaves tossed \\nand floated on the rippling stream. The air was very bright and still, and \\nthere was a silence, except for the high distant song of larks. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThey turned a sharp bend in the river, and there, sailing proudly down \\nthe stream toward them, they saw a swan of great size. The water rippled on \\neither side of the white breast beneath its curving neck. Its beak shone \\nlike burnished gold, and its eyes glinted like jet set in yellow stones; its \\nhuge white wings were half lifted. A music came down the river as it drew \\nnearer; and suddenly they perceived that it was a ship, wrought and carved \\nwith elven-skill in the likeness of a bird. Two elves clad in white steered \\nit with black paddles. In the midst of the vessel sat Celeborn, and behind \\nhim stood Galadriel, tall and white; a circlet of golden flowers was in her \\nhair, and in her hand she held a harp, and she sang. Sad and sweet was the \\nsound of her voice in the cool clear air: \\n\\nI sang of leaves, of leaves of gold, and leaves of gold there grew: \\n\\nOf wind I sang, a wind there came and in the branches blew. \\n\\nBeyond the Sun, beyond the Moon, the foam was on the Sea, \\n\\nAnd by the strand of Ilmarin there grew a golden Tree. \\n\\nBeneath the stars of Ever-eve in Eldamar it shone, \\n\\nIn Eldamar beside the walls of Elven Tirion. \\n\\nThere long the golden leaves have grown upon the branching years, \\n\\nWhile here beyond the Sundering Seas now fall the Elven-tears. \\n\\nO Lurien! The Winter comes, the bare and leafless Day; \\n\\nThe leaves are falling in the stream, the River flows away. \\n\\nO Lurien! Too long I have dwelt upon this Hither Shore \\nAnd in a fading crown have twined the golden elanor. \\n\\nBut if of ships I now should sing, what ship would come to me, \\n\\nWhat ship would bear me ever back across so wide a Sea? \\n\\nAragorn stayed his boat as the Swan-ship drew alongside. The Lady ended \\nher song and greeted them. \\'We have come to bid you our last farewell,\\' she \\nsaid, \\'and to speed you with blessings from our land.\\' \\n\\n\\'Though you have been our guests,\\' said Celeborn, \\'you have not yet \\neaten with us, and we bid you, therefore, to a parting feast, here between \\nthe flowing waters that will bear you far from Lurien.\\' \\n\\nThe Swan passed on slowly to the hythe, and they turned their boats and \\nfollowed it. There in the last end of Egladil upon the green grass the \\nparting feast was held; but Frodo ate and drank little, heeding only the \\nbeauty of the Lady and her voice. She seemed no longer perilous or terrible, \\nnor filled with hidden power. Already she seemed to him, as by men of later \\ndays Elves still at times are seen: present and yet remote, a living vision \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nof that which has already been left far behind by the flowing streams of \\nTime. \\n\\nAfter they had eaten and drunk, sitting upon the grass, Celeborn spoke \\nto them again of their journey, and lifting his hand he pointed south to the \\nwoods beyond the Tongue. \\n\\n\\'As you go down the water,\\' he said, \\'you will find that the trees will \\nfail, and you will come to a barren country. There the River flows in stony \\nvale amid high moors, until at last after many leagues it comes to the tall \\nisland of the Tindrock, that we call Tol Brandir. There it casts its arms \\nabout the steep shores of the isle, and falls then with a great noise and \\nsmoke over the cataracts of Rauros down into the Nindalf, the Wetwang as it \\nis called in your tongue. That is a wide region of sluggish fen where the \\nstream becomes tortuous and much divided. There the Entwash flows in by \\nmany \\n\\nmouths from the Forest of Fangorn in the west. About that stream, on this \\nside of the Great River, lies Rohan. On the further side are the bleak hills \\nof the Emyn Muil. The wind blows from the East there, for they look out over \\nthe Dead Marshes and the Noman-lands to Cirith Gorgor and the black gates of \\nMordor. \\n\\n\\'Boromir, and any that go with him seeking Minas Tirith, will do well \\nto leave the Great River above Rauros and cross the Entwash before it finds \\nthe marshes. Yet they should not go too far up that stream, nor risk \\nbecoming entangled in the Forest of Fangorn. That is a strange land, and is \\nnow little known. But Boromir and Aragorn doubtless do not need this \\nwarning.\\' \\n\\n\\'Indeed we have heard of Fangorn in Minas Tirith,\\' said Boromir. \\'But \\nwhat I have heard seems to me for the most part old wives\\' tales, such as we \\ntell to our children. All that lies north of Rohan is now to us so far away \\nthat fancy can wander freely there. Of old Fangorn lay upon the borders of \\nour realm; but it is now many lives of men since any of us visited it, to \\nprove or disprove the legends that have come down from distant years. \\n\\n\\'I have myself been at whiles in Rohan, but I have never crossed it \\nnorthwards. When I was sent out as a messenger, I passed through the Gap by \\nthe skirts of the White Mountains, and crossed the Isen and the Grey flood \\ninto Northerland. A long and wearisome journey. Four hundred leagues I \\nreckoned it, and it took me many months; for I lost my horse at Tharbad, at \\nthe fording of the Greyflood. After that journey, and the road I have \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntrodden with this Company, I do not much doubt that I shall find a way \\nthrough Rohan, and Fangorn too, if need be.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then I need say no more,\\' said Celeborn. \\'But do not despise the lore \\nthat has come down from distant years; for oft it may chance that old wives \\nkeep in memory word of things that once were needful for the wise to know.\\' \\n\\nNow Galadriel rose from the grass, and taking a cup from one of her \\nmaidens she filled it with white mead and gave it to Celeborn. \\n\\n\\'Now it is time to drink the cup of farewell,\\' she said. \\'Drink, Lord \\nof the Galadhrim! And let not your heart be sad though night must follow \\nnoon, and already our evening draweth nigh.\\' \\n\\nThen she brought the cup to each of the Company, and bade them drink \\nand farewell. But when they had drunk she commanded them to sit again on the \\ngrass, and chairs were set for her and for Celeborn. Her maidens stood \\nsilent about her, and a while she looked upon her guests. At last she spoke \\nagain. \\n\\n\\'We have drunk the cup of parting,\\' she said, \\'and the shadows fall \\nbetween us. But before you go, I have brought in my ship gifts which the \\nLord and Lady of the Galadhrim now offer you in memory of Lothlurien.\\' \\n\\nThen \\n\\nshe called to each in turn. \\n\\n\\'Here is the gift of Celeborn and Galadriel to the leader of your \\nCompany,\\' she said to Aragorn, and she gave him a sheath that had been made \\nto fit his sword. It was overlaid with a tracery of flowers and leaves \\nwrought of silver and gold, and on it were set in elven runes formed of many \\ngems the name And(r)ril and the lineage of the sword. \\n\\n\\'The blade that is drawn from this sheath shall not be stained or \\nbroken even in defeat,\\' she said. \\'But is there aught else that you desire \\nof me at our parting? For darkness will flow between us, and it may be that \\nwe shall not meet again, unless it be far hence upon a road that has no \\nreturning.\\' \\n\\nAnd Aragorn answered: \\'Lady, you know all my desire, and long held in \\nkeeping the only treasure that I seek. Yet it is not yours to give me, even \\nif you would; and only through darkness shall I come to it.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yet maybe this will lighten your heart,\\' said Galadriel; \\'for it was \\nleft in my care to be given to you, should you pass through this land.\\' Then \\nshe lifted from her lap a great stone of a clear green, set in a silver \\nbrooch that was wrought in the likeness of an eagle with outspread wings; \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand as she held it up the gem flashed like the sun shining through the \\nleaves of spring. \\'This stone I gave to Celebrnan my daughter, and she to \\nhers; and now it comes to you as a token of hope. In this hour take the name \\nthat was foretold for you, Elessar, the Elfstone of the house of Elendil! \\' \\n\\nThen Aragorn took the stone and pinned the brooch upon his breast, and \\nthose who saw him wondered; for they had not marked before how tall and \\nkingly he stood, and it seemed to them that many years of toil had fallen \\nfrom his shoulders. \\'For the gifts that you have given me I thank you,\\' he \\nsaid, \\'O Lady of Lurien of whom were sprung Celebrnan and Arwen \\nEvenstar. \\n\\nWhat praise could I say more? \\' \\n\\nThe Lady bowed her head, and she turned then to Boromir, and to him she \\ngave a belt of gold; and to Merry and Pippin she gave small silver belts, \\neach with a clasp wrought like a golden flower. To Legolas she gave a bow \\nsuch as the Galadhrim used, longer and stouter than the bows of Mirkwood, \\nand strung with a string of elf-hair. With it went a quiver of arrows. \\n\\n\\'For you little gardener and lover of trees,\\' she said to Sam, \\'I have \\nonly a small gift.\\' She put into his hand a little box of plain grey wood, \\nunadorned save for a single silver rune upon the lid. \\'Here is set G for \\nGaladriel,\\' she said; \\'but also it may stand for garden in your tongue. In \\nthis box there is earth from my orchard, and such blessing as Galadriel has \\nstill to bestow is upon it. It will not keep you on your road, nor defend \\nyou against any peril; but if you keep it and see your home again at last, \\nthen perhaps it may reward you. Though you should find all barren and laid \\nwaste, there will be few gardens in Middle-earth that will bloom like your \\ngarden, if you sprinkle this earth there. Then you may remember Galadriel, \\nand catch a glimpse far off of Lurien, that you have seen only in our \\nwinter. For our spring and our summer are gone by, and they will never be \\nseen on earth again save in memory.\\' \\n\\nSam went red to the ears and muttered something inaudible, as he \\nclutched the box and bowed as well as he could. \\n\\n\\'And what gift would a Dwarf ask of the Elves? \\' said Galadriel turning \\nto Gimli. \\n\\n\\'None, Lady,\\' answered Gimli. \\'It is enough for me to have seen the \\nLady of the Galadhrim, and to have heard her gentle words.\\' \\n\\n\\'Hear all ye Elves! \\' she cried to those about her. \\'Let none say again \\nthat Dwarves are grasping and ungracious! Yet surely, Gimli son of Gluin, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyou desire something that I could give? Name it, I bid you! You shall not be \\nthe only guest without a gift.\\' \\n\\n\\'There is nothing, Lady Galadriel,\\' said Gimli, bowing low and \\nstammering. \\'Nothing, unless it might be-unless it is permitted to ask. nay, \\nto name a single strand of your hair, which surpasses the gold of the earth \\nas the stars surpass the gems of the mine. I do not ask for such a gift. But \\nyou commanded me to name my desire.\\' \\n\\nThe Elves stirred and murmured with astonishment, and Celeborn gazed at \\nthe Dwarf in wonder, but the Lady smiled. \\'It is said that the skill of the \\nDwarves is in their hands rather than in their tongues \\' she said; \\'yet that \\nis not true of Gimli. For none have ever made to me a request so bold and \\nyet so courteous. And how shall I refuse, since I commanded him to speak? \\nBut tell me, what would you do with such a gift? \\' \\n\\n\\'Treasure it, Lady,\\' he answered, \\'in memory of your words to me at our \\nfirst meeting. And if ever I return to the smithies of my home, it shall be \\nset in imperishable crystal to be an heirloom of my house, and a pledge of \\ngood will between the Mountain and the Wood until the end of days.\\' \\n\\nThen the Lady unbraided one of her long tresses, and cut off three \\ngolden hairs, and laid them in Gimli\\'s hand. \\'These words shall go with the \\ngift,\\' she said. \\'I do not foretell, for all foretelling is now vain: on the \\none hand lies darkness, and on the other only hope. But if hope should not \\nfail, then I say to you, Gimli son of Gluin, that your hands shall flow with \\ngold, and yet over you gold shall have no dominion. \\n\\n\\'And you, Ring-bearer,\\' she said, turning to Frodo. \\'I come to you last \\nwho are not last in my thoughts. For you I have prepared this.\\' She held up \\na small crystal phial: it glittered as she moved it, and rays of white light \\nsprang from her hand. \\'In this phial,\\' she said, \\'is caught the light of \\nEdrendil\\'s star, set amid the waters of my fountain. It will shine still \\nbrighter when night is about you. May it be a light to you in dark places, \\nwhen all other lights go out. Remember Galadriel and her Mirror! \\' \\n\\nFrodo took the phial, and for a moment as it shone between them, he saw \\nher again standing like a queen, great and beautiful, but no longer \\nterrible. He bowed, but found no words to say. \\n\\nNow the Lady arose, and Celeborn led them back to the hythe. A yellow \\nnoon lay on the green land of the Tongue, and the water glittered with \\nsilver. All at last was made ready. The Company took their places in the \\nboats as before. Crying farewell, the Elves of Lurien with long grey poles \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthrust them out into the flowing stream, and the rippling waters bore them \\nslowly away. The travellers sat still without moving or speaking. On the \\ngreen bank near to the very point of the Tongue the Lady Galadriel stood \\nalone and silent. As they passed her they turned and their eyes watched her \\nslowly floating away from them. For so it seemed to them: Lurien was \\nslipping backward, like a bright ship masted with enchanted trees, sailing \\non to forgotten shores, while they sat helpless upon the margin of the grey \\nand leafless world. \\n\\nEven as they gazed, the Silverlode passed out into the currents of the \\nGreat River, and their boats turned and began to speed southwards. Soon the \\nwhite form of the Lady was small and distant. She shone like a window of \\nglass upon a far hill in the westering sun, or as a remote lake seen from a \\nmountain: a crystal fallen in the lap of the land. Then it seemed to Frodo \\nthat she lifted her arms in a final farewell, and far but piercing-clear on \\nthe following wind came the sound of her voice singing. But now she sang in \\nthe ancient tongue of the Elves beyond the Sea, and he did not understand \\nthe words: fair was the music, but it did not comfort him. \\n\\nYet as is the way of Elvish words, they remained graven in his memory, \\nand long afterwards he interpreted them, as well as he could: the language \\nwas that of Elven-song and spoke of things little known on Middle-earth. \\n\\nAi! lauril lantar lassi s(r)rinen, \\n\\nYjni (r)nutiml ve rbmar aldaron! \\n\\nYjni ve lintl yuldar avbnier \\nmi oromardi lisse-miruvureva \\nAnd(r)nl pella, Vardo tellumar \\nnu luini yassen tintilar i eleni \\numaryo airetbri-lnrinen. \\n\\nSn man iyulma nin enquantuva? \\n\\nAn sn Tintalll Varda Oiolosslo \\nve fanyar mbryat Elentbri ortanl \\nar ilyl tier undulbvl lumbull; \\nar sindanuriello caita mornil \\ni falmalinnar imbl met, ar hnsil \\nunt(r)pa Calaciryo mnri oiall. \\n\\nSi vanwa nb, Rumello vanwa, Valimar! \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNambril! Nai hiruvalyl Valimar. \\n\\nNai elyl hiruva. Nambril! \\n\\n\\'Ah! like gold fall the leaves in the wind, long years numberless as \\nthe wings of trees ! The long years have passed like swift draughts of the \\nsweet mead in lofty halls beyond the West, beneath the blue vaults of Varda \\nwherein the stars tremble in the song of her voice, holy and queenly. Who \\nnow shall refill the cup for me? For now the Kindler, Varda, the Queen of \\nthe Stars, from Mount Everwhite has uplifted her hands like clouds, and all \\npaths are drowned deep in shadow; and out of a grey country darkness lies on \\nthe foaming waves between us, and mist covers the jewels of Calacirya for \\never. Now lost, lost to those from the East is Valimar! Farewell! Maybe thou \\nshalt find Valimar. Maybe even thou shalt find it. Farewell! \\' Varda is the \\nname of that Fady whom the Elves in these lands of exile name Elbereth. \\n\\nSuddenly the River swept round a bend, and the banks rose upon either \\nside, and the light of Furien was hidden. To that fair land Frodo never came \\nagain. \\n\\nThe travellers now turned their faces to the journey; the sun was \\nbefore them, and their eyes were dazzled, for all were filled with tears. \\n\\nGimli wept openly. \\n\\n\\'I have looked the last upon that which was fairest,\\' he said to \\nFegolas his companion. \\'Henceforward I will call nothing fair, unless it be \\nher gift.\\' He put his hand to his breast. \\n\\n\\'Tell me, Fegolas, why did I come on this Quest? Tittle did I know \\nwhere the chief peril lay! Truly Elrond spoke, saying that we could not \\nforesee what we might meet upon our road. Torment in the dark was the danger \\nthat I feared, and it did not hold me back. But I would not have come, had I \\nknown the danger of light and joy. Now I have taken my worst wound in this \\nparting, even if I were to go this night straight to the Dark Ford. Alas for \\nGimli son of Gluin! \\' \\n\\n\\'Nay! \\' said Fegolas. \\'Alas for us all! And for all that walk the world \\nin these after-days. For such is the way of it: to find and lose, as it \\nseems to those whose boat is on the running stream. But I count you blessed, \\nGimli son of Gluin: for your loss you suffer of your own free will, and you \\nmight have chosen otherwise. But you have not forsaken your companions, \\nand \\n\\nthe least reward that you shall have is that the memory of Fothlurien shall \\nremain ever clear and unstained in your heart, and shall neither fade nor \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngrow stale.\\' \\n\\n\\'Maybe,\\' said Gimli; \\'and I thank you for your words. True words \\ndoubtless; yet all such comfort is cold. Memory is not what the heart \\ndesires. That is only a mirror, be it clear as Kheled-zvram. Or so says the \\nheart of Gimli the Dwarf. Elves may see things otherwise. Indeed I have \\nheard that for them memory is more like to the waking world than to a dream. \\nNot so for Dwarves. \\n\\n\\'But let us talk no more of it. Look to the boat! She is too low in the \\nwater with all this baggage, and the Great River is swift. I do not wish to \\ndrown my grief in cold water.\\' He took up a paddle, and steered towards the \\nwestern bank, following Aragorn\\'s boat ahead, which had already moved out of \\nthe middle stream. \\n\\nSo the Company went on their long way, down the wide hurrying waters, \\nborne ever southwards. Bare woods stalked along either bank, and they could \\nnot see any glimpse of the lands behind. The breeze died away and the River \\nflowed without a sound. No voice of bird broke the silence. The sun grew \\nmisty as the day grew old, until it gleamed in a pale sky like a high white \\npearl. Then it faded into the West, and dusk came early, followed by a grey \\nand starless night. Far into the dark quiet hours they floated on, guiding \\ntheir boats under the overhanging shadows of the western woods. Great trees \\npassed by like ghosts, thrusting their twisted thirsty roots through the \\nmist down into the water. It was dreary and cold. Frodo sat and listened to \\nthe faint lap and gurgle of the River fretting among the tree-roots and \\ndriftwood near the shore, until his head nodded and he fell into an uneasy \\nsleep. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 9 . The Great River \\n\\n\\n\\nFrodo was roused by Sam. He found that he was lying, well wrapped, \\nunder tall grey -skinned trees in a quiet corner of the woodlands on the west \\nbank of the Great River, Anduin. He had slept the night away, and the grey \\nof morning was dim among the bare branches. Gimli was busy with a small fire \\nnear at hand. \\n\\nThey started again before the day was broad. Not that most of the \\nCompany were eager to hurry southwards: they were content that the decision, \\nwhich they must make at latest when they came to Rauros and the Tindrock \\nIsle, still lay some days ahead; and they let the River bear them on at its \\nown pace, having no desire to hasten towards the perils that lay beyond, \\nwhichever course they took in the end. Aragorn let them drift with the \\nstream as they wished, husbanding their strength against weariness to come. \\nBut he insisted that at least they should start early each day and journey \\non far into the evening; for he felt in his heart that time was pressing, \\nand he feared that the Dark Lord had not been idle while they lingered in \\nLurien. \\n\\nNonetheless they saw no sign of an enemy that day, nor the next. The \\ndull grey hours passed without event. As the third day of their voyage wore \\non the lands changed slowly: the trees thinned and then failed altogether. \\n\\nOn the eastern bank to their left they saw long formless slopes stretching \\nup and away toward the sky; brown and withered they looked, as if fire had \\npassed over them, leaving no living blade of green: an unfriendly waste \\nwithout even a broken tree or a bold stone to relieve the emptiness. They \\nhad come to the Brown Lands that lay, vast and desolate, between Southern \\nMirkwood and the hills of the Emyn Muil. What pestilence or war or evil deed \\nof the Enemy had so blasted all that region even Aragorn could not tell. \\n\\nUpon the west to their right the land was treeless also, but it was \\nflat, and in many places green with wide plains of grass. On this side of \\nthe River they passed forests of great reeds, so tall that they shut out all \\nview to the west, as the little boats went rustling by along their \\nfluttering borders. Their dark withered plumes bent and tossed in the light \\ncold airs, hissing softly and sadly. Here and there through openings Frodo \\ncould catch sudden glimpses of rolling meads, and far beyond them hills in \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe sunset, and away on the edge of sight a dark line, where marched the \\nsouthernmost ranks of the Misty Mountains. \\n\\nThere was no sign of living moving things, save birds. Of these there \\nwere many: small fowl whistling and piping in the reeds, but they were \\nseldom seen. Once or twice the travellers heard the rush and whine of \\nswan-wings, and looking up they saw a great phalanx streaming along the sky. \\n\\'Swans! \\' said Sam. \\'And mighty big ones too! \\' \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Aragorn, \\'and they are black swans.\\' \\n\\n\\'How wide and empty and mournful all this country looks! \\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'I always imagined that as one journeyed south it got warmer and merrier, \\nuntil winter was left behind for ever.\\' \\n\\n\\'But we have not journeyed far south yet,\\' answered Aragorn. \\'It is \\nstill winter, and we are far from the sea. Here the world is cold until the \\nsudden spring, and we may yet have snow again. Far away down in the Bay of \\nBelfalas, to which Anduin runs, it is warm and merry, maybe, or would be but \\nfor the Enemy. But here we are not above sixty leagues, I guess, south of \\nthe Southfarthing away in your Shire, hundreds of long miles yonder. You are \\nlooking now south-west across the north plains of the Riddermark, Rohan the \\nland of the Horse-lords. Ere long we shall come to the mouth of the Limlight \\nthat runs down from Fangorn to join the Great River. That is the north \\nboundary of Rohan; and of old all that lay between Limlight and the White \\nMountains belonged to the Rohirrim. It is a rich and pleasant land, and its \\ngrass has no rival; but in these evil days folk do not dwell by the River or \\nride often to its shores. Anduin is wide, yet the ores can shoot their \\narrows far across the stream; and of late, it is said, they have dared to \\ncross the water and raid the herds and studs of Rohan.\\' \\n\\nSam looked from bank to bank uneasily. The trees had seemed hostile \\nbefore, as if they harboured secret eyes and lurking dangers; now he wished \\nthat the trees were still there. He felt that the Company was too naked, \\nafloat in little open boats in the midst of shelterless lands, and on a \\nriver that was the frontier of war. \\n\\nIn the next day or two, as they went on, borne steadily southwards, \\nthis feeling of insecurity grew on all the Company. For a whole day they \\ntook to their paddles and hastened forward. The banks slid by. Soon the \\nRiver broadened and grew more shallow; long stony beaches lay upon the east, \\nand there were gravel-shoals in the water, so that careful steering was \\nneeded. The Brown Lands rose into bleak wolds, over which flowed a chill air \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfrom the East. On the other side the meads had become rolling downs of \\nwithered grass amidst a land of fen and tussock. Frodo shivered, thinking of \\nthe lawns and fountains, the clear sun and gentle rains of Lothlurien. There \\nwas little speech and no laughter in any of the boats. Each member of the \\nCompany was busy with his own thoughts. \\n\\nThe heart of Legolas was running under the stars of a summer night in \\nsome northern glade amid the beech- woods; Gimli was fingering gold in his \\nmind, and wondering if it were fit to be wrought into the housing of the \\nLady\\'s gift. Merry and Pippin in the middle boat were ill at ease, for \\nBoromir sat muttering to himself, sometimes biting his nails, as if some \\nrestlessness or doubt consumed him, sometimes seizing a paddle and driving \\nthe boat close behind Aragorn\\'s. Then Pippin, who sat in the bow looking \\nback, caught a queer gleam in his eye, as he peered forward gazing at Frodo. \\nSam had long ago made up his mind that, though boats were maybe not as \\ndangerous as he had been brought up to believe, they were far more \\nuncomfortable than even he had imagined. Fie was cramped and miserable, \\nhaving nothing to do but stare at the winter -lands crawling by and the grey \\nwater on either side of him. Even when the paddles were in use they did not \\ntrust Sam with one. \\n\\nAs dusk drew down on the fourth day, he was looking back over the bowed \\nheads of Frodo and Aragorn and the following boats; he was drowsy and \\nlonged \\n\\nfor camp and the feel of earth under his toes. Suddenly something caught his \\nsight: at first he stared at it listlessly, then he sat up and rubbed his \\neyes; but when he looked again he could not see it any more. \\n\\nThat night they camped on a small eyot close to the western bank. Sam \\nlay rolled in blankets beside Frodo. V I had a funny dream an hour or two \\nbefore we stopped, Mr. Frodo,\\' he said. \\'Or maybe it wasn\\'t a dream. Funny \\nit was anyway.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, what was it? \\' said Frodo, knowing that Sam would not settle \\ndown until he had told his tale, whatever it was. \\'I haven\\'t seen or thought \\nof anything to make me smile since we left Lothlurien.\\' \\n\\n\\'It wasn\\'t funny that way, Mr. Frodo. It was queer. All wrong, if it \\nwasn\\'t a dream. And you had best hear it. It was like this: I saw a log with \\neyes! \\' \\n\\n\\'The log\\'s all right,\\' said Frodo. \\'There are many in the River. But \\nleave out the eyes ! \\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'That I won\\'t,\\' said Sam. \\' \\'Twas the eyes as made me sit up, so to \\nspeak. I saw what I took to be a log floating along in the half-light behind \\nGimli\\'s boat; but I didn\\'t give much heed to it. Then it seemed as if the \\nlog was slowly catching us up. And that was peculiar, as you might say, \\nseeing as we were all floating on the stream together. Just then I saw the \\neyes: two pale sort of points, shiny -like, on a hump at the near end of the \\nlog. What\\'s more, it wasn\\'t a log, for it had paddle-feet, like a swan\\'s \\nalmost, only they seemed bigger, and kept dipping in and out of the water. \\n\\n\\'That\\'s when I sat right up and rubbed my eyes, meaning to give a \\nshout, if it was still there when I had rubbed the drowse out of my head. \\n\\nFor the whatever -it-was was coming along fast now and getting close behind \\nGimli. But whether those two lamps spotted me moving and staring, or whether \\nI came to my senses, I don\\'t know. When I looked again, it wasn\\'t there. Yet \\nI think I caught a glimpse with the tail of-my eye, as the saying is, of \\nsomething dark shooting under the shadow of the bank. I couldn\\'t see no more \\neyes though. \\n\\n\\'I said to myself: \"dreaming again, Sam Gamgee,\" I said: and I said no \\nmore just then. But I\\'ve been thinking since, and now I\\'m not so sure. What \\ndo you make of it, Mr. Frodo? \\' \\n\\n\\'I should make nothing of it but a log and the dusk and sleep in your \\neyes Sam, said Frodo, if this was the first time that those eyes had been \\nseen. But it isn\\'t. I saw them away back north before we reached Lurien. And \\nI saw a strange creature with eyes climbing to the flet that night. Haldir \\nsaw it too. And do you remember the report of the Elves that went after the \\nore-band? \\' \\n\\n\\'Ah,\\' said Sam. \\'I do; and I remember more too. I don\\'t like my \\nthoughts; but thinking of one thing and another, and Mr. Bilbo\\'s stories and \\nall, I fancy I could put a name on the creature, at a guess. A nasty name. \\nGollum, maybe? \\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, that is what I have feared for some time,\\' said Frodo. \\'Ever \\nsince the night on the flet. I suppose he was lurking in Moria, and picked \\nup our trail then; but I hoped that our stay in Lurien would throw him off \\nthe scent again. The miserable creature must have been hiding in the woods \\nby the Silverlode, watching us start off! \\' \\n\\n\\'That\\'s about it,\\' said Sam. \\'And we\\'d better be a bit more watchful \\nourselves, or we\\'ll feel some nasty fingers round our necks one of these \\nnights, if we ever wake up to feel anything. And that\\'s what I was leading \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nup to. No need to trouble Strider or the others tonight. I\\'ll keep watch. I \\ncan sleep tomorrow, being no more than luggage in a boat, as you might say.\\' \\n\\nV I might,\\' said Frodo, \\'and I might say \"luggage with eyes\". You shall \\nwatch; but only if you promise to wake me halfway towards morning, if \\nnothing happens before then.\\' \\n\\nIn the dead hours Frodo came out of a deep dark sleep to find Sam \\nshaking him. \\'It\\'s a shame to wake you,\\' whispered Sam, \\'but that\\'s what you \\nsaid. There\\'s nothing to tell, or not much. I thought I heard some soft \\nplashing and a sniffing noise, a while back; but you hear a lot of such \\nqueer sounds by a river at night.\\' \\n\\nHe lay down, and Frodo sat up, huddled in his blankets, and fought off \\nhis sleep. Minutes or hours passed slowly, and nothing happened. Frodo was \\njust yielding to the temptation to lie down again when a dark shape, hardly \\nvisible, floated close to one of the moored boats. A long whitish hand could \\nbe dimly seen as it shot out and grabbed the gunwale; two pale lamplike eyes \\nshone coldly as they peered inside, and then they lifted and gazed up at \\nFrodo on the eyot. They were not more than a yard or two away, and Frodo \\nheard the soft hiss of intaken breath. He stood up, drawing Sting from its \\nsheath, and faced the eyes. Immediately their light was shut off. There was \\nanother hiss and a splash, and the dark log-shape shot away downstream into \\nthe night. Aragorn stirred in his sleep, turned over, and sat up\\' \\n\\n\\'What is it? \\' he whispered, springing up and coming to Frodo. \\'I felt \\nsomething in my sleep. Why have you drawn your sword? \\' \\n\\n\\'Gollum,\\' answered Frodo. \\'Or at least, so I guess.\\' \\n\\n\\'Ah! \\' said Aragorn. \\'So you know about our little footpad, do you? He \\npadded after us all through Moria and right down to Nimrodel. Since we took \\nto boats, he has been lying on a log and paddling with hands and feet. I \\nhave tried to catch him once or twice at night; but he is slier than a fox, \\nand as slippery as a fish. I hoped the river-voyage would beat him, but he \\nis too clever a waterman. \\n\\n\\'We shall have to try going faster tomorrow. You lie down now, and I \\nwill keep watch for what is left of the night. I wish I could lay my hands \\non the wretch. We might make him useful. But if I cannot, we shall have to \\ntry and lose him. He is very dangerous. Quite apart from murder by night on \\nhis own account, he may put any enemy that is about on our track.\\' \\n\\nThe night passed without Gollum showing so much as a shadow again. \\nAfter that the Company kept a sharp look-out, but they saw no more of Gollum \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhile the voyage lasted. If he was still following, he was very wary and \\ncunning. At Aragorn\\'s bidding they paddled now for long spells, and the \\nbanks went swiftly by. But they saw little of the country, for they \\njourneyed mostly by night and twilight, resting by day, and lying as hidden \\nas the land allowed. In this way the time passed without event until the \\nseventh day. \\n\\nThe weather was still grey and overcast, with wind from the East, but \\nas evening drew into night the sky away westward cleared, and pools of faint \\nlight, yellow and pale green, opened under the grey shores of cloud. There \\nthe white rind of the new Moon could be seen glimmering in the remote lakes. \\nSam looked at it and puckered his brows. \\n\\nThe next day the country on either side began to change rapidly. The \\nbanks began to rise and grow stony. Soon they were passing through a hilly \\nrocky land, and on both shores there were steep slopes buried in deep brakes \\nof thorn and sloe, tangled with brambles and creepers. Behind them stood low \\ncrumbling cliffs, and chimneys of grey weathered stone dark with ivy; and \\nbeyond these again there rose high ridges crowned with wind-writhen firs. \\nThey were drawing near to the grey hill -country of the Emyn Muil, the \\nsouthern march of Wilderland. \\n\\nThere were many birds about the cliffs and the rock-chimneys, and all \\nday high in the air flocks of birds had been circling, black against the \\npale sky. As they lay in their camp that day Aragorn watched the flights \\ndoubtfully, wondering if Gollum had been doing some mischief and the news \\nof \\n\\ntheir voyage was now moving in the wilderness. Later as the sun was setting, \\nand the Company was stirring and getting ready to start again, he descried a \\ndark spot against the fading light: a great bird high and far off, now \\nwheeling, now flying on slowly southwards. \\n\\n\\'What is that, Legolas? \\' he asked, pointing to the northern sky. \\'Is \\nit, as I think, an eagle? \\' \\n\\n\\'Yes.\\' said Legolas. \\'It is an eagle, a hunting eagle. I wonder what \\nthat forebodes. It is far from the mountains.\\' \\n\\n\\'We will not start until it is fully dark,\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\nThe eighth night of their journey came. It was silent and windless; the \\ngrey east wind had passed away. The thin crescent of the Moon had fallen \\nearly into the pale sunset, but the sky was clear above, and though far away \\nin the South there were great ranges of cloud that still shone faintly, in \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe West stars glinted bright. \\n\\n\\'Come! \\' said Aragorn. \\'We will venture one more journey by night. We \\nare coming to reaches of the River that I do not know well: for I have never \\njourneyed by water in these parts before, not between here and the rapids of \\nSarn Gebir. But if I am right in my reckoning, those are still many miles \\nahead. Still there are dangerous places even before we come there: rocks and \\nstony eyots in the stream. We must keep a sharp watch and not try to paddle \\nswiftly.\\' \\n\\nTo Sam in the leading boat was given the task of watchman. He lay \\nforward peering into the gloom. The night grew dark, but the stars above \\nwere strangely bright, and there was a glimmer On the face of the River. It \\nwas close on midnight, and they had been drifting for some while, hardly \\nusing the paddles, when suddenly Sam cried out. Only a few yards ahead dark \\nshapes loomed up in the stream and he heard the swirl of racing water. There \\nwas a swift current which swung left, towards the eastern shore where the \\nchannel was clear. As they were swept aside the travellers could see, now \\nvery close, the pale foam of the River lashing against sharp rocks that were \\nthrust out far into the stream like a ridge of teeth. The boats were all \\nhuddled together. \\n\\n\\'Hoy there, Aragorn! \\' shouted Boromir, as his boat bumped into the \\nleader. \\'This is madness! We cannot dare the Rapids by night! But no boat \\ncan live in Sarn Gebir, be it night or day.\\' \\n\\n\\'Back, back! \\' cried Aragorn. Turn! Turn if you can! \\' He drove his \\npaddle into the water, trying to hold the boat and bring it round. \\n\\n\\'I am out of my reckoning,\\' he said to Frodo. \\'I did not know that we \\nhad come so far: Anduin flows faster than I thought. Sarn Gebir must be \\nclose at hand already.\\' \\n\\nWith great efforts they checked the boats and slowly brought them \\nabout; but at first they could make only small headway against the current, \\nand all the time they were carried nearer and nearer to the eastern bank. \\n\\nNow dark and ominous it loomed up in the night. \\n\\n\\'All together, paddle! \\' shouted Boromir. \\'Paddle! Or we shall be \\ndriven on the shoals.\\' Even as he spoke Frodo felt the keel beneath him \\ngrate upon stone. \\n\\nAt that moment there was a twang of bowstrings: several arrows whistled \\nover them, and some fell among them. One smote Frodo between the \\nshoulders \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand he lurched forward with a cry, letting go his paddle: but the arrow fell \\nback, foiled by his hidden coat of mail. Another passed through Aragorn\\'s \\nhood; and a third stood fast in the gunwale of the second boat, close by \\nMerry\\'s hand. Sam thought he could glimpse black figures running to and fro \\nupon the long shingle -banks that lay under the eastern shore. They seemed \\nvery near. \\n\\n\\' Yrch !\\' said Legolas, falling into his own tongue. \\n\\n\\'Ores! \\' cried Gimli. \\n\\n\\'Gollum\\'s doing, I\\'ll be bound.\\' said Sam to Frodo. \\'And a nice place \\nto choose, too. The River seems set on taking us right into their arms! \\' \\n\\nThey all leaned forward straining at the paddles: even Sam took a hand. \\nEvery moment they expected to feel the bite of black -feathered arrows. Many \\nwhined overhead or struck the water nearby; but there were no more hits. It \\nwas dark, but not too dark for the night-eyes of Ores, and in the \\nstar-glimmer they must have offered their cunning foes some mark, unless it \\nwas that the grey cloaks Of Lurien and the grey timber of the elf- wrought \\nboats defeated the malice of the archers of Mordor. \\n\\nStroke by stroke they laboured on. In the darkness it was hard to be \\nsure that they were indeed moving at all; but slowly the swirl of the water \\ngrew less, and the shadow of the eastern bank faded back into the night. At \\nlast, as far as they could judge, they had reached the middle of the stream \\nagain and had driven their boats back some distance above the jutting rocks. \\nThen half turning they thrust them with all their strength towards the \\nwestern shore. Under the shadow Of bushes leaning out over the water they \\nhalted and drew breath. \\n\\nLegolas laid down his paddle and took up the bow that he had brought \\nfrom Lurien. Then he sprang ashore and climbed a few paces up the bank. \\nStringing the bow and fitting an arrow he turned, peering back over the \\nRiver into the darkness. Across the water there were shrill cries, but \\nnothing could be seen. \\n\\nFrodo looked up at the Elf standing tall above him, as he gazed into \\nthe night, seeking a mark to shoot at. His head was dark, crowned with sharp \\nwhite stars that glittered in the black pools of the sky behind. But now \\nrising and sailing up from the South the great clouds advanced, sending out \\ndark outriders into the starry fields. A sudden dread fell on the Company. \\n\\n\\' Elbereth Gilthoniel!\\' sighed Legolas as he looked up. Even as he did \\nso, a dark shape, like a cloud and yet not a cloud, for it moved far more \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nswiftly, came out of the blackness in the South, and sped towards the \\nCompany, blotting out all light as it approached. Soon it appeared as a \\ngreat winged creature, blacker than the pits in the night. Fierce voices \\nrose up to greet it from across the water. Frodo felt a sudden chill running \\nthrough him and clutching at his heart; there was a deadly cold, like the \\nmemory of an old wound, in his shoulder. He crouched down, as if to hide. \\n\\nSuddenly the great bow of Lurien sang. Shrill went the arrow from the \\nelven-string. Frodo looked up. Almost above him the winged shape swerved. \\nThere was a harsh croaking scream, as it fell out of the air, vanishing down \\ninto the gloom of the eastern shore. The sky was clean again. There was a \\ntumult of many voices far away, cursing and wailing in the darkness, and \\nthen silence. Neither shaft nor cry came again from the east that night. \\n\\nAfter a while Aragorn led the boats back upstream. They felt their way \\nalong the water\\'s edge for some distance, until they found a small shallow \\nbay. A few low trees grew there close to the water, and behind them rose a \\nsteep rocky bank. Here the Company decided to stay and await the dawn: it \\nwas useless to attempt to move further by night. They made no camp and lit \\nno fire, but lay huddled in the boats, moored close together. \\n\\n\\'Praised be the bow of Galadriel, and the hand and eye of Legolas ! \\' \\nsaid Gimli, as he munched a wafer of lembas. \\'That was a mighty shot in the \\ndark, my friend!\\' \\n\\n\\'But who can say what it hit?\\' said Legolas. \\n\\n\\'I cannot,\\' said Gimli. \\'But I am glad that the shadow came no nearer. \\n\\nI liked it not at all. Too much it reminded me of the shadow in Moria -- the \\nshadow of the Balrog,\\' he ended in a whisper. \\n\\n\\'It was not a Balrog,\\' said Frodo, still shivering with the chill that \\nhad come upon him. \\'It was something colder. I think it was -- \\' Then he \\npaused and fell silent. \\n\\n\\'What do you think? \\' asked Boromir eagerly, leaning from his boat, as \\nif he was trying to catch a glimpse of Frodo\\'s face. \\n\\n\\'I think -- No, I will not say,\\' answered Frodo. \\'Whatever it was, its \\nfall has dismayed our enemies.\\' \\n\\n\\'So it seems,\\' said Aragorn. \\'Yet where they are, and how many, and \\nwhat they will do next, we do not know. This night we must all be sleepless! \\nDark hides us now. But what the day will show who can tell? Have your \\nweapons close to hand! \\' \\n\\nSam sat tapping the hilt of his sword as if he were counting on his \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfingers, and looking up at the sky. \"It\\'s very strange,\\' he murmured. \\'The \\nMoon\\'s the same in the Shire and in Wilderland, or it ought to be. But \\neither it\\'s out of its running, or I\\'m all wrong in my reckoning. You\\'ll \\nremember, Mr. Frodo, the Moon was waning as we lay on the flet up in that \\ntree: a week from the full, I reckon. And we\\'d been a week on the way last \\nnight, when up pops a New Moon as thin as a nail-paring, as if we had never \\nstayed no time in the Elvish country. \\n\\n\\'Well, I can remember three nights there for certain, and I seem to \\nremember several more, but I would take my oath it was never a whole month. \\nAnyone would think that time did not count in there! \\' \\n\\n\\'And perhaps that was the way of it,\\' said Frodo. \\'In that land, maybe, \\nwe were in a time that has elsewhere long gone by. It was not, I think, \\nuntil Silverlode bore us back to Anduin that we returned to the time that \\nflows through mortal lands to the Great Sea. And I don\\'t remember any moon, \\neither new or old, in Caras Galadhon: only stars by night and sun by day.\\' \\n\\nLegolas stirred in his boat. \\'Nay, time does not tarry ever,\\' he said; \\n\\n\\'but change and growth is not in all things and places alike. For the Elves \\nthe world moves, and it moves both very swift and very slow. Swift, because \\nthey themselves change little, and all else fleets by: it is a grief to \\nthem. Slow, because they do not count the running years, not for themselves. \\nThe passing seasons are but ripples ever repeated in the long long stream. \\n\\nYet beneath the Sun all things must wear to an end at last.\\' \\n\\n\\'But the wearing is slow in Lurien,\\' said Frodo. \\'The power of the Lady \\nis on it. Rich are the hours, though short they seem, in Caras Galadhon, \\nwhere Galadriel wields the Elven-ring.\\' \\n\\n\\'That should not have been said outside Lurien, not even to me,\\' said \\nAragorn. \\'Speak no more of it! But so it is, Sam: in that land you lost your \\ncount. There time flowed swiftly by us, as for the Elves. The old moon \\npassed, and a new moon waxed and waned in the world outside, while we \\ntarried there. And yestereve a new moon came again. Winter is nearly gone. \\nTime flows on to a spring of little hope.\\' \\n\\nThe night passed silently. No voice or call was heard again across the \\nwater. The travellers huddled in their boats felt the changing of the \\nweather. The air grew warm and very still under the great moist clouds that \\nhad floated up from the South and the distant seas. The rushing of the River \\nover the rocks of the rapids seemed to grow louder and closer. The twigs of \\nthe trees above them began to drip. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the day came the mood of the world about them had become soft and \\nsad. Slowly the dawn grew to a pale light, diffused and shadowless. There \\nwas mist on the River, and white fog swathed the shore; the far bank could \\nnot be seen. \\n\\n\\'I can\\'t abide fog,\\' said Sam; \\'but this seems to be a lucky one. Now \\nperhaps we can get away without those cursed goblins seeing us.\\' \\n\\n\\'Perhaps so,\\' said Aragorn. \\'But it will be hard to find the path \\nunless the fog lifts a little later on. And we must find the path, if we are \\nto pass Sarn Gebir and come to the Emyn Muil.\\' \\n\\n\\'I do not see why we should pass the Rapids or follow the River any \\nfurther,\\' said Boromir. \\'If the Emyn Muil lie before us, then we can abandon \\nthese cockle-boats, and strike westward and southward, until we come to the \\nEntwash and cross into my own land.\\' \\n\\n\\'We can, if we are making for Minas Tirith,\\' said Aragorn, \\'but that is \\nnot yet agreed. And such a course may be more perilous than it sounds. The \\nvale of Entwash is flat and fenny, and fog is a deadly peril there for those \\non foot and laden. I would not abandon our boats until we must. The River is \\nat least a path that cannot be missed.\\' \\n\\n\\'But the Enemy holds the eastern bank,\\' objected Boromir. \\'And even if \\nyou pass the Gates of Argonath and come unmolested to the Tindrock, what \\nwill you do then? Leap down the Falls and land in the marshes? \\' \\n\\n\\'No! \\' answered Aragorn. \\'Say rather that we will bear our boats by the \\nancient way to Rauros-foot, and there take to the water again. Do you not \\nknow, Boromir, or do you choose to forget the North Stair, and the high seat \\nupon Amon Hen, that were made in the days of the great kings? I at least \\nhave a mind to stand in that high place again, before I decide my further \\ncourse. There, maybe, we shall see some sign that will guide us.\\' \\n\\nBoromir held out long against this choice; but when it became plain \\nthat Frodo would follow Aragorn, wherever he went, he gave in. \\'It is not \\nthe way of the Men of Minas Tirith to desert their friends at need,\\' he \\nsaid, \\'and you will need my strength, if ever you are to reach the Tindrock. \\n\\nTo the tall isle I will go, but no further. There I shall turn to my home, \\nalone if my help has not earned the reward of any companionship.\\' \\n\\nThe day was now growing, and the fog had lifted a little. It was \\ndecided that Aragorn and Legolas should at once go forward along the shore, \\nwhile the others remained by the boats. Aragorn hoped to find some way by \\nwhich they could carry both their boats and their baggage to the smoother \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwater beyond the Rapids. \\n\\n\\'Boats of the Elves would not sink, maybe,\\' he said, \\'but that does not \\nsay that we should come through Sarn Gebir alive. None have ever done so \\nyet. No road was made by the Men of Gondor in this region, for even in their \\ngreat days their realm did not reach up Anduin beyond the Emyn Muil; but \\nthere is a portage-way somewhere on the western shore, if I can find it. It \\ncannot yet have perished; for light boats used to journey out of Wilderland \\ndown to Osgiliath, and still did so until a few years ago, when the Ores of \\nMordor began to multiply.\\' \\n\\n\\'Seldom in my life has any boat come out of the North, and the Ores \\nprowl on the east-shore,\\' said Boromir. \\'If you go forward, peril will grow \\nwith every mile, even if you find a path.\\' \\n\\n\\'Peril lies ahead on every southward road,\\' answered Aragorn. \\'Wait for \\nus one day. If we do not return in that time, you will know that evil has \\nindeed befallen us. Then you must take a new leader and follow him as best \\nyou can.\\' \\n\\nIt was with a heavy heart that Frodo saw Aragorn and Legolas climb the \\nsteep bank and vanish into the mists; but his fears proved groundless. Only \\ntwo or three hours had passed, and it was barely mid-day, when the shadowy \\nshapes of the explorers appeared again. \\n\\n\\'All is well,\\' said Aragorn, as he clambered down the bank. \\'There is a \\ntrack, and it leads to a good landing that is still serviceable. The \\ndistance is not great: the head of the Rapids is but half a mile below us, \\nand they are little more than a mile long. Not far beyond them the stream \\nbecomes clear and smooth again, though it runs swiftly. Our hardest task \\nwill be to get our boats and baggage to the old portage- way. We have found \\nit, but it lies well back from the water-side here, and runs under the lee \\nof a rock-wall, a furlong or more from the shore. We did not find where the \\nnorthward landing lies. If it still remains, we must have passed it \\nyesterday night. We might labour far upstream and yet miss it in the fog. I \\nfear we must leave the River now, and make for the portage-way as best we \\ncan from here.\\' \\n\\n\\'That would not be easy, even if we were all Men,\\' said Boromir. \\n\\n\\'Yet such as we are we will try it,\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\n\\'Aye, we will,\\' said Gimli. \\'The legs of Men will lag on a rough road, \\nwhile a Dwarf goes on, be the burden twice his own weight, Master Boromir! \\' \\n\\nThe task proved hard indeed, yet in the end it was done. The goods were \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntaken out of the boats and brought to the top of the bank, where there was a \\nlevel space. Then the boats were drawn out of the water and carried up. They \\nwere far less heavy than any had expected. Of what tree growing in the \\nelvish country they were made not even Legolas knew; but the wood was \\ntough \\n\\nand yet strangely light. Merry and Pippin alone could carry their boat with \\nease along the flat. Nonetheless it needed the strength of the two Men to \\nlift and haul them over the ground that the Company now had to cross. It \\nsloped up away from the River, a tumbled waste of grey limestone-boulders, \\nwith many hidden holes shrouded with weeds and bushes; there were thickets \\nof brambles, and sheer dells; and here and there boggy pools fed by waters \\ntrickling from the terraces further inland. \\n\\nOne by one Boromir and Aragorn carried the boats, while the others \\ntoiled and scrambled after them with the baggage. At last all was removed \\nand laid on the portage-way. Then with little further hindrance, save from \\nsprawling briars and many fallen stones, they moved forward all together. \\nFog still hung in veils upon the crumbling rock-wall, and to their left mist \\nshrouded the River: they could hear it rushing and foaming over the sharp \\nshelves and stony teeth of Sarn Gebir, but they could not see it. Twice they \\nmade the journey, before all was brought safe to the southern landing. \\n\\nThere the portage-way, turning back to the water-side, ran gently down \\nto the shallow edge of a little pool. It seemed to have been scooped in the \\nriver-side, not by hand, but by the water swirling down from Sarn Gebir \\nagainst a low pier of rock that jutted out some way into the stream. Beyond \\nit the shore rose sheer into a grey cliff, and there was no further passage \\nfor those on foot. \\n\\nAlready the short afternoon was past, and a dim cloudy dusk was closing \\nin. They sat beside the water listening to the confused rush and roar of the \\nRapids hidden in the mist; they were tired and sleepy, and their hearts were \\nas gloomy as the dying day. \\n\\n\\'Well, here we are, and here we must pass another night,\\' said Boromir. \\n\\n\\'We need sleep, and even if Aragorn had a mind to pass the Gates of Argonath \\nby night, we are all too tired-except, no doubt, our sturdy dwarf.\\' \\n\\nGimli made no reply: he was nodding as he sat. \\n\\n\\'Let us rest as much as we can now,\\' said Aragorn. \\'Tomorrow we must \\njourney by day again. Unless the weather changes once more and cheats us, we \\nshall have a good chance of slipping through, unseen by any eyes on the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\neastern shore. But tonight two must watch together in turns: three hours off \\nand one on guard.\\' \\n\\nNothing happened that night worse than a brief drizzle of rain an hour \\nbefore dawn. As soon as it was fully light they started. Already the fog was \\nthinning. They kept as close as they could to the western side, and they \\ncould see the dim shapes of the low cliffs rising ever higher, shadowy walls \\nwith their feet in the hurrying river. In the mid-morning the clouds drew \\ndown lower, and it began to rain heavily. They drew the skin -covers over \\ntheir boats to prevent them from being flooded, and drifted on: little could \\nbe seen before them or about them through the grey falling curtains. \\n\\nThe rain, however, did not last long. Slowly the sky above grew \\nlighter, and then suddenly the clouds broke, and their draggled fringes \\ntrailed away northward up the River. The fogs and mists were gone. Before \\nthe travellers lay a wide ravine, with great rocky sides to which clung, \\nupon shelves and in narrow crevices, a few thrawn trees. The channel grew \\nnarrower and the River swifter. Now they were speeding along with little \\nhope of stopping or turning, whatever they might meet ahead. Over them was a \\nlane of pale-blue sky, around them the dark overshadowed River, and before \\nthem black, shutting out the sun, the hills of Emyn Muil, in which no \\nopening could be seen. \\n\\nFrodo peering forward saw in the distance two great rocks approaching: \\nlike great pinnacles or pillars of stone they seemed. Tall and sheer and \\nominous they stood upon either side of the stream. A narrow gap appeared \\nbetween them, and the River swept the boats towards it. \\n\\n\\'Behold the Argonath, the Pillars of the Kings! \\' cried Aragorn. \\'We \\nshall pass them soon. Keep the boats in line, and as far apart as you can! \\n\\nHold the middle of the stream! \\' \\n\\nAs Frodo was borne towards them the great pillars rose like towers to \\nmeet him. Giants they seemed to him, vast grey figures silent but \\nthreatening. Then he saw that they were indeed shaped and fashioned: the \\ncraft and power of old had wrought upon them, and still they preserved \\nthrough the suns and rains of forgotten years the mighty likenesses in which \\nthey had been hewn. Upon great pedestals founded in the deep waters stood \\ntwo great kings of stone: still with blurred eyes and crannied brows they \\nfrowned upon the North. The left hand of each was raised palm outwards in \\ngesture of warning; in each right hand there was an axe; upon each head \\nthere was a crumbling helm and crown. Great power and majesty they still \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwore, the silent wardens of a long -vanished kingdom. Awe and fear fell upon \\nFrodo, and he cowered down, shutting his eyes and not daring to look up as \\nthe boat drew near. Even Boromir bowed his head as the boats whirled by. \\nfrail and fleeting as little leaves, under the enduring shadow of the \\nsentinels of N(r)menor. So they passed into the dark chasm of the Gates. \\n\\nSheer rose the dreadful cliffs to unguessed heights on either side. Far \\noff was the dim sky. The black waters roared and echoed, and a wind screamed \\nover them. Frodo crouching over his knees heard Sam in front muttering and \\ngroaning: \\'What a place! What a horrible place! Just let me get out of this \\nboat, and I\\'ll never wet my toes in a puddle again, let alone a river! \\' \\n\\n\\'Fear not!\\' said a strange voice behind him. Frodo turned and saw \\nStrider, and yet not Strider; for the weatherworn Ranger was no longer \\nthere. In the stern sat Aragorn son of Arathorn, proud and erect, guiding \\nthe boat with skilful strokes; his hood was cast back, and his dark hair was \\nblowing in the wind, a light was in his eyes: a king returning from exile to \\nhis own land. \\n\\n\\'Fear not! \\' he said. \\'Long have I desired to look upon the likenesses \\nof Isildur and Anbrion, my sires of old. Under their shadow Elessar, the \\nElfstone son of Arathorn of the House of Valandil Isildur\\'s son heir of \\nElendil, has nought to dread! \\' \\n\\nThen the light of his eyes faded, and he spoke to himself: \\'Would that \\nGandalf were here! How my heart yearns for Minas Anor and the walls of my \\nown city! But whither now shall I go? \\' \\n\\nThe chasm was long and dark, and filled with the noise of wind and \\nrushing water and echoing stone. It bent somewhat towards the west so that \\nat first all was dark ahead; but soon Frodo saw a tall gap of light before \\nhim, ever growing. Swiftly it drew near, and suddenly the boats shot \\nthrough, out into a wide clear light. \\n\\nThe sun, already long fallen from the noon, was shining in a windy sky. \\n\\nThe pent waters spread out into a long oval lake, pale Nen Hithoel, fenced \\nby steep grey hills whose sides were clad with trees, but their heads were \\nbare, cold-gleaming in the sunlight. At the far southern end rose three \\npeaks. The midmost stood somewhat forward from the others and sundered \\nfrom \\n\\nthem, an island in the waters, about which the flowing River flung pale \\nshimmering arms. Distant but deep there came up on the wind a roaring sound \\nlike the roll of thunder heard far away. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Behold Tol Brandir! \\' said Aragorn, pointing south to the tall peak. \\n\\n\\'Upon the left stands Amon Lhaw, and upon the right is Amon Hen the Hills of \\nHearing and of Sight. In the days of the great kings there were high seats \\nupon them, and watch was kept there. But it is said that no foot of man or \\nbeast has ever been set upon Tol Brandir. Ere the shade of night falls we \\nshall come to them. I hear the endless voice of Rauros calling.\\' \\n\\nThe Company rested now for a while, drifting south on the current that \\nflowed through the middle of the lake. They ate some food, and then they \\ntook to their paddles and hastened on their way. The sides of the westward \\nhills fell into shadow, and the Sun grew round and red. Here and there a \\nmisty star peered out. The three peaks loomed before them, darkling in the \\ntwilight. Rauros was roaring with a great voice. Already night was laid on \\nthe flowing waters when the travellers came at last under the shadow of the \\nhills. \\n\\nThe tenth day of their journey was over. Wilderland was behind them. \\nThey could go no further without choice between the east-way and the west. \\nThe last stage of the Quest was before them. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 10. The Breaking of the Fellowship \\n\\n\\n\\nAragorn led them to the right arm of the River. Here upon its western \\nside under the shadow of Tol Brandir a green lawn ran down to the water from \\nthe feet of Amon Hen. Behind it rose the first gentle slopes of the hill \\nclad with trees, and trees marched away westward along the curving shores of \\nthe lake. A little spring fell tumbling down and fed the grass. \\n\\n\\'Here we will rest tonight,\\' said Aragorn. \\'This is the lawn of Parth \\nGalen: a fair place in the summer days of old. Let us hope that no evil has \\nyet come here.\\' \\n\\nThey drew up their boats on the green banks, and beside them they made \\ntheir camp. They set a watch, but had no sight nor sound of their enemies. \\n\\nIf Gollum had contrived to follow them, he remained unseen and unheard. \\nNonetheless as the night wore on Aragorn grew uneasy, tossing often in his \\nsleep and waking. In the small hours he got up and came to Frodo, whose turn \\nit was to watch. \\n\\n\\'Why are you waking? \\' asked Frodo. \\'It is not your watch.\\' \\n\\n\\'I do not know,\\' answered Aragorn; \\'but a shadow and a threat has been \\ngrowing in my sleep. It would be well to draw your sword.\\' \\n\\n\\'Why? \\' said Frodo. \\'Are enemies at hand? \\' \\n\\n\\'Let us see what Sting may show,\\' answered Aragorn. \\n\\nFrodo then drew the elf-blade from its sheath. To his dismay the edges \\ngleamed dimly in the night. \\'Ores! \\' he said. \\'Not very near, and yet too \\nnear, it seems.\\' \\n\\n\\'I feared as much,\\' said Aragorn. \\'But maybe they are not on this side \\nof the River. The light of Sting is faint, and it may point to no more than \\nspies of Mordor roaming on the slopes of Amon Lhaw. I have never heard \\nbefore of Ores upon Amon Hen. Yet who knows what may happen in these \\nevil \\n\\ndays, now that Minas Tirith no longer holds secure the passages of Anduin. \\nWe must go warily tomorrow.\\' \\n\\nThe day came like fire and smoke. Low in the East there were black bars \\nof cloud like the fumes of a great burning. The rising sun lit them from \\nbeneath with flames of murky red; but soon it climbed above them into a \\nclear sky. The summit of Tol Brandir was tipped with gold. Frodo looked out \\n\\n\\n\\n\\neastward and gazed at the tall island. Its sides sprang sheer out of the \\nrunning water. High up above the tall cliffs were steep slopes upon which \\ntrees climbed, mounting one head above another; and above them again were \\ngrey faces of inaccessible rock, crowned by a great spire of stone. Many \\nbirds were circling about it, but no sign of other living things could be \\nseen. \\n\\nWhen they had eaten, Aragorn called the Company together. \\'The day has \\ncome at last,\\' he said: \\'the day of choice which we have long delayed. What \\nshall now become of our Company that has travelled so far in fellowship? \\nShall we turn west with Boromir and go to the wars of Gondor; or turn east \\nto the Fear and Shadow; or shall we break our fellowship and go this way and \\nthat as each may choose? Whatever we do must be done soon. We cannot \\nlong \\n\\nhalt here. The enemy is on the eastern shore, we know; but I fear that the \\nOres may already be on this side of the water.\\' \\n\\nThere was a long silence in which no one spoke or moved. \\n\\n\\'Well, Frodo,\\' said Aragorn at last. \\'I fear that the burden is laid \\nupon you. You are the Bearer appointed by the Council. Your own way you \\nalone can choose. In this matter I cannot advise you. I am not Gandalf, and \\nthough I have tried to bear his part, I do not know what design or hope he \\nhad for this hour, if indeed he had any. Most likely it seems that if he \\nwere here now the choice would still wait on you. Such is your fate.\\' \\n\\nFrodo did not answer at once. Then he spoke slowly. \\'I know that haste \\nis needed, yet I cannot choose. The burden is heavy. Give me an hour longer, \\nand I will speak. Let me be alone! \\' \\n\\nAragorn looked at him with kindly pity. \\'Very well, Frodo son of \\nDrogo,\\' he said. \\'You shall have an hour, and you shall be alone. We will \\nstay here for a while. But do not stray far or out of call.\\' \\n\\nFrodo sat for a moment with his head bowed. Sam, who had been watching \\nhis master with great concern, shook his head and muttered: \\'Plain as a \\npikestaff it is, but it\\'s no good Sam Gamgee putting in his spoke just now.\\' \\n\\nPresently Frodo got up and walked away; and Sam saw that while the \\nothers restrained themselves and did not stare at him, the eyes of Boromir \\nfollowed Frodo intently, until he passed out of sight in the trees at the \\nfoot of Amon Hen. \\n\\nWandering aimlessly at first in the wood, Frodo found that his feet \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwere leading him up towards the slopes of the hill. He came to a path, the \\ndwindling ruins of a road of long ago. In steep places stairs of stone had \\nbeen hewn, but now they were cracked and worn, and split by the roots of \\ntrees. For some while he climbed, not caring which way he went, until he \\ncame to a grassy place. Rowan-trees grew about it, and in the midst was a \\nwide flat stone. The little upland lawn was open upon the East and was \\nfilled now with the early sunlight. Frodo halted and looked out over the \\nRiver, far below him, to Tol Brandir and the birds wheeling in the great \\ngulf of air between him and the untrodden isle. The voice of Rauros was a \\nmighty roaring mingled with a deep throbbing boom. \\n\\nHe sat down upon the stone and cupped his chin in his hands, staring \\neastwards but seeing little with his eyes. All that had happened since Bilbo \\nleft the Shire was passing through his mind, and he recalled and pondered \\neverything that he could remember of Gandalf s words. Time went on, and \\nstill he was no nearer to a choice. \\n\\nSuddenly he awoke from his thoughts: a strange feeling came to him that \\nsomething was behind him, that unfriendly eyes were upon him. He sprang up \\nand turned; but all that he saw to his surprise was Boromir, and his face \\nwas smiling and kind. \\n\\n\\'I was afraid for you, Frodo,\\' he said, coming forward. \\'If Aragorn is \\nright and Ores are near, then none of us should wander alone, and you least \\nof all: so much depends on you. And my heart too is heavy. May I stay now \\nand talk for a while, since I have found you? It would comfort me. Where \\nthere are so many, all speech becomes a debate without end. But two together \\nmay perhaps find wisdom.\\' \\n\\n\\'You are kind,\\' answered Frodo. \\'But I do not think that any speech \\nwill help me. For I know what I should do, but I am afraid of doing it, \\nBoromir: afraid.\\' \\n\\nBoromir stood silent. Rauros roared endlessly on. The wind murmured in \\nthe branches of the trees. Frodo shivered. \\n\\nSuddenly Boromir came and sat beside him. \\'Are you sure that you do not \\nsuffer needlessly? \\' he said. \\'I wish to help you. You need counsel in your \\nhard choice. Will you not take mine? \\' \\n\\n\\'I think I know already what counsel you would give, Boromir,\\' said \\nFrodo. \\'And it would seem like wisdom but for the warning of my heart.\\' \\n\\n\\'Warning? Warning against what? \\' said Boromir sharply. \\n\\n\\'Against delay. Against the way that seems easier. Against refusal of \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe burden that is laid on me. Against -well, if it must be said, against \\ntrust in the strength and truth of Men.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yet that strength has long protected you far away in your little \\ncountry, though you knew it not.\\' \\n\\n\\'I do not doubt the valour of your people. But the world is changing. \\n\\nThe walls of Minas Tirith may be strong, but they are not strong enough. If \\nthey fail, what then? \\' \\n\\n\\'We shall fall in battle valiantly. Yet there is still hope that they \\nwill not fail.\\' \\n\\n\\'No hope while the Ring lasts,\\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'Ah! The Ring! \\' said Boromir, his eyes lighting. \\'The Ring! Is it not \\na strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt for so small a \\nthing? So small a thing! And I have seen it only for an instant in the House \\nof Elrond. Could I not have a sight of it again? \\' \\n\\nFrodo looked up. His heart went suddenly cold. He caught the strange \\ngleam in Boromir\\'s eyes, yet his face was still kind and friendly. \\'It is \\nbest that it should lie hidden,\\' he answered. \\n\\n\\'As you wish. I care not,\\' said Boromir. \\'Yet may I not even speak of \\nit? For you seem ever to think only of its power in the hands of the Enemy: \\nof its evil uses not of its good. The world is changing, you say. Minas \\nTirith will fall, if the Ring lasts. But why? Certainly, if the Ring were \\nwith the Enemy. But why, if it were with us? \\' \\n\\n\\'Were you not at the Council? \\' answered Frodo. \\'Because we cannot use \\nit, and what is done with it turns to evil.\\' \\n\\nBoromir got up and walked about impatiently. \\'So you go on,\\' he cried. \\n\\'Gandalf, Elrond -- all these folk have taught you to say so. For themselves \\nthey may be right. These elves and half-elves and wizards, they would come \\nto grief perhaps. Yet often I doubt if they are wise and not merely timid. \\n\\nBut each to his own kind. True-hearted Men, they will not be corrupted. We \\nof Minas Tirith have been staunch through long years of trial. We do not \\ndesire the power of wizard-lords, only strength to defend ourselves, \\nstrength in a just cause. And behold! in our need chance brings to light the \\n-Ring of Power. It is a gift, I say; a gift to the foes of Mordor. It is mad \\nnot to use it, to use the power of the Enemy against him. The fearless, the \\nruthless, these alone will achieve victory. What could not a warrior do in \\nthis hour, a great leader? What could not Aragorn do? Or if he refuses, why \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnot Boromir? The Ring would give me power of Command. How I would \\ndrive the \\n\\nhosts of Mordor, and all men would flock to my banner!\\' \\n\\nBoromir strode up and down, speaking ever more loudly: Almost he seemed \\nto have forgotten Frodo, while his talk dwelt on walls and weapons, and the \\nmustering of men; and he drew plans for great alliances and glorious \\nvictories to be; and he cast down Mordor, and became himself a mighty king, \\nbenevolent and wise. Suddenly he stopped and waved his arms. \\n\\n\\'And they tell us to throw it away!\\' he cried. \\'I do not say destroy \\nit. That might be well, if reason could show any hope of doing so. It does \\nnot. The only plan that is proposed to us is that a halfling should walk \\nblindly into Mordor and offer the Enemy every chance of recapturing it for \\nhimself. Folly! \\n\\n\\'Surely you see it, my friend?\\' he said, turning now suddenly to Frodo \\nagain. \\'You say that you are afraid. If it is so, the boldest should pardon \\nyou. But is it not really your good sense that revolts?\\' \\n\\n\\'No, I am afraid,\\' said Frodo. \\'Simply afraid. But I am glad to have \\nheard you speak so fully. My mind is clearer now.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then you will come to Minas Tirith? \\' cried Boromir. His eyes were \\nshining and his face eager. \\n\\n\\'You misunderstand me,\\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'But you will come, at least for a while? \\' Boromir persisted. \\'My city \\nis not far now; and it is little further from there to Mordor than from \\nhere. We have been long in the wilderness, and you need news of what the \\nEnemy is doing before you make a move. Come with me, Frodo,\\' he said. \\n\\'You \\n\\nneed rest before your venture, if go you must.\\' He laid his hand on the \\nhobbit\\'s shoulder in friendly fashion; but Frodo felt the hand trembling \\nwith suppressed excitement. He stepped quickly away, and eyed with alarm the \\ntall Man, nearly twice his height and many times his match in strength. \\n\\n\\'Why are you so unfriendly? \\' said Boromir. \\'I am a true man, neither \\nthief nor tracker. I need your Ring: that you know now; but I give you my \\nword that I do not desire to keep it. Will you not at least let me make \\ntrial of my plan? Lend me the Ring! \\' \\n\\n\\'No! no! \\' cried Frodo. \\'The Council laid it upon me to bear it.\\' \\n\\n\\'It is by our own folly that the Enemy will defeat us,\\' cried Boromir. \\n\\n\\'How it angers me! Fool! Obstinate fool! Running wilfully to death and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmining our cause. If any mortals have claim to the Ring, it is the men of \\nN(r)menor, and not Halflings. It is not yours save by unhappy chance. It might \\nhave been mine. It should be mine. Give it to me ! \\' \\n\\nFrodo did not answer, but moved away till the great flat stone stood \\nbetween them. \\'Come, come, my friend! \\' said Boromir in a softer voice. \\'Why \\nnot get rid of it? Why not be free of your doubt and fear? You can lay the \\nblame on me, if you will. You can say that I was too strong and took it by \\nforce. For I am too strong for you, halfling,\\' he cried; and suddenly he \\nsprang over the stone and leaped at Frodo. His fair and pleasant face was \\nhideously changed; a raging fire was in his eyes. \\n\\nFrodo dodged aside and again put the stone between them. There was only \\none thing he could do: trembling he pulled out the Ring upon its chain and \\nquickly slipped it on his finger, even as Boromir sprang at him again. The \\nMan gasped, stared for a moment amazed, and then ran wildly about, seeking \\nhere and there among the rocks and trees. \\n\\n\\'Miserable trickster!\\' he shouted. \\'Let me get my hands on you! Now I \\nsee your mind. You will take the Ring to Sauron and sell us all. You have \\nonly waited your chance to leave us in the lurch. Curse you and all \\nhalflings to death and darkness ! \\' Then, catching his foot on a stone, he \\nfell sprawling and lay upon his face. For a while he was as still as if his \\nown curse had struck him down; then suddenly he wept. \\n\\nHe rose and passed his hand over his eyes, dashing away the tears. \\n\\n\\'What have I said? \\' he cried. \\'What have I done? Frodo, Frodo! \\' he called. \\n\\'Come back! A madness took me, but it has passed. Come back! \\' \\n\\nThere was no answer. Frodo did not even hear his cries. He was already \\nfar away, leaping blindly up the path to the hill-top. Terror and grief \\nshook him, seeing in his thought the mad fierce face of Boromir, and his \\nburning eyes. \\n\\nSoon he came out alone on the summit of Amon Hen, and halted, gasping \\nfor breath. He saw as through a mist a wide flat circle, paved with mighty \\nflags, and surrounded with a crumbling battlement; and in the middle, set \\nupon four carven pillars, was a high seat, reached by a stair of many steps. \\n\\nUp he went and sat upon the ancient chair, feeling like a lost child that \\nhad clambered upon the throne of mountain -kings. \\n\\nAt first he could see little. He seemed to be in a world of mist in \\nwhich there were only shadows: the Ring was upon him. Then here and there \\nthe mist gave way and he saw many visions: small and clear as if they were \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nunder his eyes upon a table, and yet remote. There was no sound, only bright \\nliving images. The world seemed to have shrunk and fallen silent. He was \\nsitting upon the Seat of Seeing, on Amon Hen, the Hill of the Eye of the Men \\nof N(r)menor. Eastward he looked into wide uncharted lands, nameless plains, \\nand forests unexplored. Northward he looked, and the Great River lay like a \\nribbon beneath him, and the Misty Mountains stood small and hard as broken \\nteeth. Westward he looked and saw the broad pastures of Rohan; and Orthanc, \\nthe pinnacle of Isengard, like a black spike. Southward he looked, and below \\nhis very feet the Great River curled like a toppling wave and plunged over \\nthe falls of Rauros into a foaming pit; a glimmering rainbow played upon the \\nfume. And Ethir Anduin he saw, the mighty delta of the River, and myriads of \\nsea-birds whirling like a white dust in the sun, and beneath them a green \\nand silver sea, rippling in endless lines. \\n\\nBut everywhere he looked he saw the signs of war. The Misty Mountains \\nwere crawling like anthills: ores were issuing out of a thousand holes. \\n\\nUnder the boughs of Mirkwood there was deadly strife of Elves and Men and \\nfell beasts. The land of the Beornings was aflame; a cloud was over Moria; \\nsmoke rose on the borders of Lurien. \\n\\nHorsemen were galloping on the grass of Rohan; wolves poured from \\nIsengard. From the havens of Harad ships of war put out to sea; and out of \\nthe East Men were moving endlessly: swordsmen, spearmen, bowmen upon \\nhorses, \\n\\nchariots of chieftains and laden wains. All the power of the Dark Lord was \\nin motion. Then turning south again he beheld Minas Tirith. Far away it \\nseemed, and beautiful: white-walled, many -towered, proud and fair upon its \\nmountain- seat; its battlements glittered with steel, and its turrets were \\nbright with many banners. Hope leaped in his heart. But against Minas Tirith \\nwas set another fortress, greater and more strong. Thither, eastward, \\nunwilling his eye was drawn. It passed the ruined bridges of Osgiliath, the \\ngrinning gates of Minas Morgul. and the haunted Mountains, and it looked \\nupon Gorgoroth, the valley of terror in the Land of Mordor. Darkness lay \\nthere under the Sun. Fire glowed amid the smoke. Mount Doom was burning, \\nand \\n\\na great reek rising. Then at last his gaze was held: wall upon wall, \\nbattlement upon battlement, black, immeasurably strong, mountain of iron, \\ngate of steel, tower of adamant, he saw it: Barad-dyr, Fortress of Sauron. \\n\\nAll hope left him. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd suddenly he felt the Eye. There was an eye in the Dark Tower that \\ndid not sleep. He knew that it had become aware of his gaze. A fierce eager \\nwill was there. It leaped towards him; almost like a finger he felt it, \\nsearching for him. Very soon it would nail him down, know just exactly where \\nhe was. Amon Lhaw it touched. It glanced upon Tol Brandir he threw himself \\nfrom the seat, crouching, covering his head with his grey hood. \\n\\nHe heard himself crying out: Never, never! Or was it: Verily I come, I \\ncome to you ? He could not tell. Then as a flash from some other point of \\npower there came to his mind another thought: Take it off! Take it off! \\n\\nFool, take it off! Take off the Ring! \\n\\nThe two powers strove in him. For a moment, perfectly balanced between \\ntheir piercing points, he writhed, tormented. Suddenly he was aware of \\nhimself again. Frodo, neither the Voice nor the Eye: free to choose, and \\nwith one remaining instant in which to do so. He took the Ring off his \\nfinger. He was kneeling in clear sunlight before the high seat. A black \\nshadow seemed to pass like an arm above him; it missed Amon Hen and \\ngroped \\n\\nout west, and faded. Then all the sky was clean and blue and birds sang in \\nevery tree. \\n\\nFrodo rose to his feet. A great weariness was on him, but his will was \\nfirm and his heart lighter. He spoke aloud to himself. T will do now what I \\nmust,\\' he said. This at least is plain: the evil of the Ring is already at \\nwork even in the Company, and the Ring must leave them before it does more \\nharm. I will go alone. Some I cannot trust, and those I can trust are too \\ndear to me: poor old Sam, and Merry and Pippin. Strider, too: his heart \\nyearns for Minas Tirith, and he will be needed there, now Boromir has fallen \\ninto evil. I will go alone. At once.\\' \\n\\nHe went quickly down the path and came back to the lawn where Boromir \\nhad found him. Then he halted, listening. He thought he could hear cries and \\ncalls from the woods near the shore below. \\n\\n\\'They\\'ll be hunting for me,\\' he said. T wonder how long I have been \\naway. Hours, I should think.\\' He hesitated. \\'What can I do? \\' he muttered. \\n\\n\\'I must go now or I shall never go. I shan\\'t get a chance again. I hate \\nleaving them, and like this without any explanation. But surely they will \\nunderstand. Sam will. And what else can I do?\\' \\n\\nSlowly he drew out the Ring and put it on once more. He vanished and \\npassed down the hill, less than a rustle of the wind. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe others remained long by the river -side. For some time they had been \\nsilent, moving restlessly about; but now they were sitting in a circle, and \\nthey were talking. Every now and again they made efforts to speak of other \\nthings, of their long road and many adventures; they questioned Aragorn \\nconcerning the realm of Gondor and its ancient history, and the remnants of \\nits great works that could still be seen in this strange border -land of the \\nEmyn Muil: the stone kings and the seats of Lhaw and Hen, and the great \\nStair beside the falls of Rauros. But always their thoughts and words \\nstrayed back to Frodo and the Ring. What would Frodo choose to do? Why \\nwas \\n\\nhe hesitating? \\n\\n\\'He is debating which course is the most desperate, I think,\\' said \\nAragorn. \\'And well he may. It is now more hopeless than ever for the Company \\nto go east, since we have been tracked by Gollum, and must fear that the \\nsecret of our journey is already betrayed. But Minas Tirith is no nearer to \\nthe Fire and the destruction of the Burden. \\n\\n\\'We may remain there for a while and make a brave stand; but the Lord \\nDenethor and all his men cannot hope to do what even Elrond said was beyond \\nhis power: either to keep the Burden secret, or to hold off the full might \\nof the Enemy when he comes to take it. Which way would any of us choose in \\nFrodo\\'s place? I do not know. Now indeed we miss Gandalf most.\\' \\n\\n\\'Grievous is our loss,\\' said Legolas. \\'Yet we must needs make up our \\nminds without his aid. Why cannot we decide, and so help Frodo? Let us call \\nhim back and then vote! I should vote for Minas Tirith.\\' \\n\\n\\'And so should I,\\' said Gimli. \\'We, of course, were only sent to help \\nthe Bearer along the road, to go no further than we wished; and none of us \\nis under any oath or command to seek Mount Doom. Hard was my parting \\nfrom \\n\\nLothlurien. Yet I have come so far, and I say this: now we have reached the \\nlast choice, it is clear to me that I cannot leave Frodo. I would choose \\nMinas Tirith, but if he does not, then I follow him.\\' \\n\\n\\'And I too will go with him,\\' said Legolas. \\'It would be faithless now \\nto say farewell.\\' \\n\\n\\'It would indeed be a betrayal, if we all left him,\\' said Aragorn. \\'But \\nif he goes east, then all need not go with him; nor do I think that all \\nshould. That venture is desperate: as much so for eight as for three or two, \\nor one alone. If you would let me choose, then I should appoint three \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncompanions: Sam, who could not bear it otherwise; and Gimli; and myself. \\nBoromir will return to his own city, where his father and his people need \\nhim; and with him the others should go, or at least Meriadoc and Peregrin, \\nif Legolas is not willing to leave us.\\' \\n\\n\\'That won\\'t do at all! \\' cried Merry. \\'We can\\'t leave Frodo! Pippin and \\nI always intended to go wherever he went, and we still do. But we did not \\nrealize what that would mean. It seemed different so far away, in the Shire \\nor in Ri vendell. It would be mad and cruel to let Frodo go to Mordor. Why \\ncan\\'t we stop him?\\' \\n\\n\\'We must stop him,\\' said Pippin. \\'And that is what he is worrying \\nabout, I am sure. He knows we shan\\'t agree to his going east. And he doesn\\'t \\nlike to ask anyone to go with him, poor old fellow. Imagine it: going off to \\nMordor alone! \\' Pippin shuddered. \\'But the dear silly old hobbit, he ought \\nto know that he hasn\\'t got to ask. He ought to know that if we can\\'t stop \\nhim, we shan\\'t leave him.\\' \\n\\n\\'Begging your pardon,\\' said Sam. \\'I don\\'t think you understand my \\nmaster at all. He isn\\'t hesitating about which way to go. Of course not! \\nWhat\\'s the good of Minas Tirith anyway? To him, I mean, begging your \\npardon, \\n\\nMaster Boromir,\\' he added, and turned. It was then that they discovered that \\nBoromir, who at first had been sitting silent on the outside of the circle, \\nwas no longer there. \\n\\n\\'Now where\\'s he got to? \\' cried Sam, looking worried. \\'He\\'s been a bit \\nqueer lately, to my mind. But anyway he\\'s not in this business. He\\'s off to \\nhis home, as he always said; and no blame to him. But Mr. Frodo, he knows \\nhe\\'s got to find the Cracks of Doom, if he can. But he\\'s afraid. Now it\\'s \\ncome to the point, he\\'s just plain terrified. That\\'s what his trouble is. Of \\ncourse he\\'s had a bit of schooling, so to speak-we all have-since we left \\nhome, or he\\'d be so terrified he\\'d just fling the Ring in the River and \\nbolt. But he\\'s still too frightened to start. And he isn\\'t worrying about us \\neither: whether we\\'ll go along with him or no. He knows we mean to. That\\'s \\nanother thing that\\'s bothering him. If he screws himself up to go, he\\'ll \\nwant to go alone. Mark my words! We\\'re going to have trouble when he \\ncomes \\n\\nback. For he\\'ll screw himself up all right, as sure as his name\\'s Baggins.\\' \\n\\n\\'I believe you speak more wisely than any of us, Sam,\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\'And what shall we do, if you prove right? \\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Stop him! Don\\'t let him go! \\' cried Pippin. \\n\\n\\'I wonder? \\' said Aragorn. \\'He is the Bearer, and the fate of the \\nBurden is on him. I do not think that it is our part to drive him one way or \\nthe other. Nor do I think that we should succeed, if we tried. There are \\nother powers at work far stronger.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, I wish Frodo would \"screw himself up\" and come back, and let us \\nget it over,\\' said Pippin. \\'This waiting is horrible! Surely the time is up? \\n\\nf \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Aragorn. \\'The hour is long passed. The morning is wearing \\naway. We must call for him.\\' \\n\\nAt that moment Boromir reappeared. He came out from the trees and \\nwalked towards them without speaking. His face looked grim and sad. He \\npaused as if counting those that were present, and then sat down aloof, with \\nhis eyes on the ground. \\n\\n\\'Where have you been, Boromir? \\' asked Aragorn. \\'Have you seen Frodo? \\' \\n\\nBoromir hesitated for a second. \\'Yes, and no,\\' he answered slowly. \\n\\n\\'Yes: I found him some way up the hill, and I spoke to him. I urged him to \\ncome to Minas Tirith and not to go east. I grew angry and he left me. He \\nvanished. I have never seen such a thing happen before, though I have heard \\nof it in tales. He must have put the Ring on. I could not find him again. I \\nthought he would return to you.\\' \\n\\n\\'Is that all that you have to say? \\' said Aragorn, looking hard and not \\ntoo kindly at Boromir. \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' he answered. \\'I will say no more yet.\\' \\n\\n\\'This is bad!\\' cried Sam, jumping up. \\'I don\\'t know what this Man has \\nbeen up to. Why should Mr. Frodo put the thing on? He didn\\'t ought to have; \\nand if he has, goodness knows what may have happened!\\' \\n\\n\\'But he wouldn\\'t keep it on\\' 1 said Merry. \\'Not when he had escaped the \\nunwelcome visitor, like Bilbo used to.\\' \\n\\n\\'But where did he go? Where is he? \\' cried Pippin. \\'He\\'s been away ages \\nnow.\\' \\n\\n\\'How long is it since you saw Frodo last, Boromir? \\' asked Aragorn. \\n\\n\\'Half an hour, maybe,\\' he answered. \\'Or it might be an hour. I have \\nwandered for some time since. I do not know! I do not know! \\' He put his \\nhead in his hands, and sat as if bowed with grief. \\n\\n\\'An hour since he vanished! \\' shouted Sam. \\'We must try and find him at \\nonce. Come on! \\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Wait a moment! \\' cried Aragorn. \\'We must divide up into pairs, and \\narrange-here, hold on! Wait! \\' \\n\\nIt was no good. They took no notice of him. Sam had dashed off first. \\nMerry and Pippin had followed, and were already disappearing westward into \\nthe trees by the shore, shouting: Frodo! Frodo ! in their clear, high \\nhobbit- voices. Legolas and Gimli were running. A sudden panic or madness \\nseemed to have fallen on the Company. \\n\\n\\'We shall all be scattered and lost,\\' groaned Aragorn. \\'Boromir! I do \\nnot know what part you have played in this mischief, but help now! Go after \\nthose two young hobbits, and guard them at the least, even if you cannot \\nfind Frodo. Come back to this spot, if you find him, or any traces of him. I \\nshall return soon.\\' \\n\\nAragorn sprang swiftly away and went in pursuit of Sam. Just as he \\nreached the little lawn among the rowans he overtook him, toiling uphill, \\npanting and calling, Frodo! \\n\\n\\'Come with me, Sam! \\' he said. \\'None of us should be alone. There is \\nmischief about. I feel it. I am going to the top, to the Seat of Amon Hen, \\nto see what may be seen. And look! It is as my heart guessed, Frodo went \\nthis way. Follow me, and keep your eyes open! \\' He sped up the path. \\n\\nSam did his best, but he could not keep up with Strider the Ranger, and \\nsoon fell behind. He had not gone far before Aragorn was out of sight ahead. \\nSam stopped and puffed. Suddenly he clapped his hand to his head. \\n\\n\\'Whoa, Sam Gamgee! \\' he said aloud. \\'Your legs are too short, so use \\nyour head! Let me see now! Boromir isn\\'t lying, that\\'s not his way; but he \\nhasn\\'t told us everything. Something scared Mr. Frodo badly. He screwed \\nhimself up to the point, sudden. He made up his mind at last to go. Where \\nto? Off East. Not without Sam? Yes, without even his Sam. That\\'s hard, cruel \\nhard.\\' \\n\\nSam passed his hand over his eyes, brushing away the tears. \\'Steady, \\nGamgee! \\' he said. \\'Think, if you can! He can\\'t fly across rivers, and he \\ncan\\'t jump waterfalls. He\\'s got no gear. So he\\'s got to get back to the \\nboats. Back to the boats! Back to the boats, Sam, like lightning! \\' \\n\\nSam turned and bolted back down the path. He fell and cut his knees. Up \\nhe got and ran on. He came to the edge of the lawn of Parth Galen by the \\nshore, where the boats were drawn up out of the water. No one was there. \\nThere seemed to be cries in the woods behind, but he did not heed them. He \\nstood gazing for a moment, stock-still, gaping. A boat was sliding down the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbank all by itself. With a shout Sam raced across the grass. The boat \\nslipped into the wat \\n\\n\\n\\n128d \\n\\n\\n\\ner. \\n\\n\\'Coming, Mr. Frodo! Coming! \\' called Sam, and flung himself from the \\nbank, clutching at the departing boat. He missed it by a yard. With a cry \\nand a splash he fell face downward into deep swift water. Gurgling he went \\nunder, and the River closed over his curly head. \\n\\nAn exclamation of dismay came from the empty boat. A paddle swirled and \\nthe boat put about. Frodo was just in time to grasp Sam by the hair as he \\ncame up, bubbling and struggling. Fear was staring in his round brown eyes. \\n\\n\\'Up you come, Sam my lad! \\' said Frodo. \\'Now take my hand! \\' \\n\\n\\'Save me, Mr. Frodo! \\' gasped Sam. \\'I\\'m drownded. I can\\'t see your \\nhand.\\' \\n\\n\\'Here it is. Don\\'t pinch, lad! I won\\'t let you go. Tread water and \\ndon\\'t flounder, or you\\'ll upset the boat. There now, get hold of the side, \\nand let me use the paddle! \\' \\n\\nWith a few strokes Frodo brought the boat back to the bank, and Sam was \\nable to scramble out, wet as a water-rat. Frodo took off the Ring and \\nstepped ashore again. \\n\\n\\'Of all the confounded nuisances you are the worst, Sam! \\' he said. \\n\\n\\'Oh, Mr. Frodo, that\\'s hard! \\' said Sam shivering. \\'That\\'s hard, trying \\nto go without me and all. If I hadn\\'t a guessed right, where would you be \\nnow? \\' \\n\\n\\'Safely on my way.\\' \\n\\n\\'Safely! \\' said Sam. \\'All alone and without me to help you? I couldn\\'t \\nhave a borne it, it\\'d have been the death of me.\\' \\n\\n\\'It would be the death of you to come with me, Sam,\\' said Frodo and I \\ncould not have borne that.\\' \\n\\n\\'Not as certain as being left behind,\\' said Sam. \\n\\n\\'But I am going to Mordor.\\' \\n\\n\\'I know that well enough, Mr. Frodo. Of course you are. And I\\'m coming \\nwith you.\\' \\n\\n\\'Now, Sam,\\' said Frodo, \\'don\\'t hinder me! The others will be coming \\nback at any minute. If they catch me here. I shall have to argue and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nexplain, and I shall never have the heart or the chance to get off. But I \\nmust go at once. It\\'s the only way.\\' \\n\\n\\'Of course it is,\\' answered Sam. \\'But not alone. I\\'m coming too, or \\nneither of us isn\\'t going. I\\'ll knock holes in all the boats first.\\' \\n\\nFrodo actually laughed. A sudden warmth and gladness touched his heart. \\n\\'Leave one! \\'he said. \\'We\\'ll need it. But you can\\'t come like this without \\nyour gear or food or anything.\\' \\n\\n\\'Just hold on a moment, and I\\'ll get my stuff!\\' cried Sam eagerly. \\n\\n\\'It\\'s all ready. I thought we should be off today.\\' He rushed to the camping \\nplace, fished out his pack from the pile where Frodo had laid it when he \\nemptied the boat of his companions\\' goods grabbed a spare blanket, and some \\nextra packages of food, and ran back. \\n\\n\\'So all my plan is spoilt! \\' said Frodo. \\'It is no good trying to \\nescape you. But I\\'m glad, Sam. I cannot tell you how glad. Come along! It is \\nplain that we were meant to go together. We will go, and may the others find \\na safe road! Strider will look after them. I don\\'t suppose we shall see them \\nagain.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yet we may, Mr Frodo. We may,\\' said Sam. \\n\\nSo Frodo and Sam set off on the last stage of the Quest together. Frodo \\npaddled away from the shore, and the River bore them swiftly away, down the \\nwestern arm, and past the frowning cliffs of Tol Brandir. The roar of the \\ngreat falls drew nearer. Even with such help as Sam could give, it was hard \\nwork to pass across the current at the southward end of the island and drive \\nthe boat eastward towards the far shore. \\n\\nAt length they came to land again upon the southern slopes of Amon \\nLhaw. There they found a shelving shore, and they drew the boat out, high \\nabove the water, and hid it as well as they could behind a great boulder. \\n\\nThen shouldering their burdens, they set off, seeking a path that would \\nbring them over the grey hills of the Emyn Muil, and down into the Land of \\nShadow. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere ends the first part of the history of the War of the Ring. \\n\\nThe second part is called THE TWO TOWERS, since the events recounted \\nin it are dominated by ORTHANC, the citadel of Saruman, and the fortress \\no/MINAS MORGUL that guards the secret entrance to Mordor; it tells of \\nthe deeds and perils of all the members of the now sundered fellowship, until \\nthe coming of the Great Darkness. \\n\\nThe third part tells of the last defence against the Shadow, and the \\nend of the mission of the Ring-bearer in THE RETURN OF THE KING. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"THE LORD OF THE RINGS \\n\\nPart Two \\n\\n\\n\\nTHE \\n\\nTWO TOWERS \\n\\n\\n\\nJ.R.R.ToIkien \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* BOOK III * \\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 1 . The Departure of Boromir \\n\\nAragorn sped on up the hill. Every now and again he bent to the ground. \\nHobbits go light, and their footprints are not easy even for a Ranger to \\nread, but not far from the top a spring crossed the path, and in the wet \\nearth he saw what he was seeking. \\n\\n\\'I read the signs aright,\\' he said to himself. \\'Frodo ran to the \\nhill-top. I wonder what he saw there? But he returned by the same way, and \\nwent down the hill again.\\' \\n\\nAragorn hesitated. He desired to go to the high seat himself, hoping to \\nsee there something that would guide him in his perplexities; but time was \\npressing. Suddenly he leaped forward, and ran to the summit, across the \\ngreat flag-stones, and up the steps. Then sitting in the high seat he looked \\nout. But the sun seemed darkened, and the world dim and remote. He turned \\nfrom the North back again to North, and saw nothing save the distant hills, \\nunless it were that far away he could see again a great bird like an eagle \\nhigh in the air, descending slowly in wide circles down towards the earth. \\n\\nEven as he gazed his quick ears caught sounds in the woodlands below, \\non the west side of the River. He stiffened. There were cries, and among \\nthem, to his horror, he could distinguish the harsh voices of Ores. Then \\nsuddenly with a deep-throated call a great horn blew, and the blasts of it \\nsmote the hills and echoed in the hollows, rising in a mighty shout above \\nthe roaring of the falls. \\n\\n\\'The horn of Boromir!\\' he cried. \\'He is in need!\\' He sprang down the \\nsteps and away, leaping down the path. \\'Alas ! An ill fate is on me this day, \\nand all that I do goes amiss. Where is Sam?\\' \\n\\nAs he ran the cries came louder, but fainter now and desperately the \\nhorn was blowing. Fierce and shrill rose the yells of the Ores, and suddenly \\nthe horn-calls ceased. Aragorn raced down the last slope, but before he \\ncould reach the hill\\'s foot, the sounds died away; and as he turned to the \\nleft and ran towards them they retreated, until at last he could hear them \\nno more. Drawing his bright sword and crying Elendil! Elendil! he crashed \\nthrough the trees. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA mile, maybe, from Parth Galen in a little glade not far from the lake \\nhe found Boromir. He was sitting with his back to a great tree, as if he was \\nresting. But Aragorn saw that he was pierced with many black-feathered \\narrows; his sword was still in his hand, but it was broken near the hilt; \\nhis horn cloven in two was at his side. Many Ores lay slain, piled all about \\nhim and at his feet. \\n\\nAragorn knelt beside him. Boromir opened his eyes and strove to speak. \\n\\nAt last slow words came. \\'I tried to take the Ring from Frodo \\' he said. \\'I \\nam sorry. I have paid.\\' His glance strayed to his fallen enemies; twenty at \\nleast lay there. \\'They have gone: the Halflings: the Ores have taken them. I \\nthink they are not dead. Ores bound them.\\' He paused and his eyes closed \\nwearily. After a moment he spoke again. \\n\\n\\'Farewell, Aragorn! Goto Minas Tirith and save my people! I have \\nfailed.\\' \\n\\n\\'No!\\' said Aragorn, taking his hand and kissing his brow. \\'You have \\nconquered. Few have gained such a victory. Be at peace! Minas Tirith shall \\nnot fall!\\' \\n\\nBoromir smiled. \\n\\n\\'Which way did they go? Was Frodo there?\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\nBut Boromir did not speak again. \\n\\n\\'Alas!\\' said Aragorn. \\'Thus passes the heir of Denethor, Lord of the \\nTower of Guard! This is a bitter end. Now the Company is all in ruin. It is \\nI that have failed. Vain was Gandalfs trust in me. What shall I do now? \\nBoromir has laid it on me to go to Minas Tirith, and my heart desires it; \\nbut where are the Ring and the Bearer? How shall I find them and save the \\nQuest from disaster?\\' \\n\\nHe knelt for a while, bent with weeping, still clasping Boromir\\'s hand. \\n\\nSo it was that Legolas and Gimli found him. They came from the western \\nslopes of the hill, silently, creeping through the trees as if they were \\nhunting. Gimli had his axe in hand, and Legolas his long knife: all his \\narrows were spent. When they came into the glade they halted in amazement; \\nand then they stood a moment with heads bowed in grief, for it seemed to \\nthem plain what had happened. \\n\\n\\'Alas!\\' said Legolas, coming to Aragorn\\'s side. \\'We have hunted and \\nslain many Ores in the woods, but we should have been of more use here. We \\ncame when we heard the horn-but too late, it seems. I fear you have taken \\ndeadly hurt.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Boromir is dead,\\' said Aragorn. \\'I am unscathed, for I was not here \\nwith him. He fell defending the hobbits, while I was away upon the hill.\\' \\n\\n\\'The hobbits!\\' cried Gimli \\'Where are they then? Where is Frodo?\\' \\n\\n\\'I do not know,\\' answered Aragorn wearily. \\'Before he died Boromir told \\nme that the Ores had bound them; he did not think that they were dead. I \\nsent him to follow Merry and Pippin; but I did not ask him if Frodo or Sam \\nwere with him: not until it was too late. All that I have done today has \\ngone amiss. What is to be done now?\\' \\n\\n\\'First we must tend the fallen,\\' said Legolas. \\'We cannot leave him \\nlying like carrion among these foul Ores.\\' \\n\\n\\'But we must be swift,\\' said Gimli. \\'He would not wish us to linger. We \\nmust follow the Ores, if there is hope that any of our Company are living \\nprisoners.\\' \\n\\n\\'But we do not know whether the Ring-bearer is with them or not \\' said \\nAragorn. \\'Are we to abandon him? Must we not seek him first? An evil choice \\nis now before us!\\' \\n\\n\\'Then let us do first what we must do,\\' said Legolas. \\'We have not the \\ntime or the tools to bury our comrade fitly, or to raise a mound over him. A \\ncairn we might build.\\' \\n\\n\\'The labour would be hard and long: there are no stones that we could \\nuse nearer than the water -side,\\' said Gimli. \\n\\n\\'Then let us lay him in a boat with his weapons, and the weapons of his \\nvanquished foes,\\' said Aragorn. \\'We will send him to the Falls of Rauros and \\ngive him to Anduin. The River of Gondor will take care at least that no evil \\ncreature dishonours his bones.\\' \\n\\nQuickly they searched the bodies of the Ores, gathering their swords \\nand cloven helms and shields into a heap. \\'See!\\' cried Aragorn. \\'Here we \\nfind tokens!\\' He picked out from the pile of grim weapons two knives, \\nleaf-bladed, damasked in gold and red; and searching further he found also \\nthe sheaths, black, set with small red gems. \\'No ore-tools these!\\' he said. \\n\\n\\'They were borne by the hobbits. Doubtless the Ores despoiled them, but \\nfeared to keep the knives, knowing them for what they are: work of \\nWesternesse, wound about with spells for the bane of Mordor. Well, now, if \\nthey still live, our friends are weaponless. I will take these things, \\nhoping against hope, to give them back.\\' \\n\\n\\'And I,\\' said Legolas, \\'will take all the arrows that I can find, for \\nmy quiver is empty.\\' He searched in the pile and on the ground about and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfound not a few that were undamaged and longer in the shaft than such arrows \\nas the Ores were accustomed to use. He looked at them closely. \\n\\nAnd Aragorn looked on the slain, and he said: \\'Here lie many that are \\nnot folk of Mordor. Some are from the North, from the Misty Mountains, if I \\nknow anything of Ores and their kinds. And here are others strange to me. \\nTheir gear is not after the manner of Ores at all!\\' \\n\\nThere were four goblin- soldiers of greater stature, swart, slant-eyed, \\nwith thick legs and large hands. They were armed with short broad-bladed \\nswords, not with the curved scimitars usual with Ores: and they had bows of \\nyew, in length and shape like the bows of Men. Upon their shields they bore \\na strange device: a small white hand in the centre of a black field; on the \\nfront of their iron helms was set an S-rune, wrought of some white metal. \\n\\n\\'I have not seen these tokens before,\\' said Aragorn. \\'What do they \\nmean?\\' \\n\\n\\'S is for Sauron,\\' said Gimli. That is easy to read.\\' \\n\\n\\'Nay!\\' said Legolas. \\'Sauron does not use the Elf-runes.\\' \\n\\n\\'Neither does he use his right name, nor permit it to be spelt or \\nspoken,\\' said Aragorn. \\'And he does not use white. The Ores in the service \\nof Barad-dyr use the sign of the Red Eye.\\' He stood for a moment in thought. \\n\\'S is for Saruman, I guess,\\' he said at length. \\'There is evil afoot in \\nIsengard, and the West is no longer safe. It is as Gandalf feared: by some \\nmeans the traitor Saruman has had news of our journey. It is likely too that \\nhe knows of Gandalf s fall. Pursuers from Moria may have escaped the \\nvigilance of Lurien, or they may have avoided that land and come to Isengard \\nby other paths. Ores travel fast. But Saruman has many ways of learning \\nnews. Do you remember the birds?\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, we have no time to ponder riddles,\\' said Gimli. \\'Let us bear \\nBoromir away!\\' \\n\\n\\'But after that we must guess the riddles, if we are to choose our \\ncourse rightly,\\' answered Aragorn. \\n\\n\\'Maybe there is no right choice,\\' said Gimli. \\n\\nTaking his axe the Dwarf now cut several branches. These they lashed \\ntogether with bowstrings, and spread their cloaks upon the frame. Upon this \\nrough bier they carried the body of their companion to the shore, together \\nwith such trophies of his last battle as they chose to send forth with him. \\n\\nIt was only a short way, yet they found it no easy task, for Boromir was a \\nman both tall and strong. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the water-side Aragorn remained, watching the bier, while Legolas \\nand Gimli hastened back on foot to Parth Galen. It was a mile or more, and \\nit was some time before they came back, paddling two boats swiftly along the \\nshore. \\n\\nThere is a strange tale to tell!\\' said Legolas. \\'There are only two \\nboats upon the bank. We could find no trace of the other.\\' \\n\\n\\'Have Ores been there?\\' asked Aragorn. \\n\\n\\'We saw no signs of them,\\' answered Gimli. \\'And Ores would have taken \\nor destroyed all the boats, and the baggage as well.\\' \\n\\n\\'I will look at the ground when we come there,\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\nNow they laid Boromir in the middle of the boat that was to bear him \\naway. The grey hood and elven-cloak they folded and placed beneath his head. \\nThey combed his long dark hair and arrayed it upon his shoulders. The golden \\nbelt of Lurien gleamed about his waist. His helm they set beside him, and \\nacross his lap they laid the cloven horn and the hilts and shards of his \\nsword; beneath his feet they put the swords of his enemies. Then fastening \\nthe prow to the stern of the other boat, they drew him out into the water. \\n\\nThey rowed sadly along the shore, and turning into the swift-running channel \\nthey passed the green sward of Parth Galen. The steep sides of Tol Brandir \\nwere glowing: it was now mid-afternoon. As they went south the fume of \\nRauros rose and shimmered before them, a haze of gold. The rush and thunder \\nof the falls shook the windless air. \\n\\nSorrowfully they cast loose the funeral boat: there Boromir lay, \\nrestful, peaceful, gliding upon the bosom of the flowing water. The stream \\ntook him while they held their own boat back with their paddles. He floated \\nby them, and slowly his boat departed, waning to a dark spot against the \\ngolden light; and then suddenly it vanished. Rauros roared on unchanging. \\nThe River had taken Boromir son of Denethor, and he was not seen again in \\nMinas Tirith, standing as he used to stand upon the White Tower in the \\nmorning. But in Gondor in after-days it long was said that the elven-boat \\nrode the falls and the foaming pool, and bore him down through Osgiliath, \\nand past the many mouths of Anduin, out into the Great Sea at night under \\nthe stars. \\n\\nFor a while the three companions remained silent, gazing after him. \\n\\nThen Aragorn spoke. \\'They will look for him from the White Tower,\\' he said, \\n\\'but he will not return from mountain or from sea.\\' Then slowly he began to \\nsing: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThrough Rohan over fen and field where the long grass grows \\nThe West Wind comes walking, and about the walls it goes. \\n\\n\\'What news from the West, O wandering wind, do you bring to me tonight? \\n\\nHave you seen Boromir the Tall by moon or by starlight?\\' \\n\\n7 saw him ride over seven streams, over waters wide and grey; \\n\\nI saw him walk in empty lands, until he passed away \\nInto the shadows of the North. I saw him then no more. \\n\\nThe North Wind may have heard the horn of the son of Denethor. \\' \\n\\n\\'O Boromir! From the high walls westward I looked afar, \\n\\nBut you came not from the empty lands where no men are. \\' \\n\\nThen Legolas sang: \\n\\nFrom the mouths of the Sea the South Wind flies, from the sandhills and the stones; \\nThe wailing of the gulls it bears, and at the gate it moans. \\n\\n\\'What news from the South, O sighing wind, do you bring to me at eve? \\n\\nWhere now is Boromir the Fair? He tarries and I grieve. \\' \\n\\n\\'Ask not of me where he doth dwell-so many bones there lie \\nOn the white shores and the dark shores under the stormy sky; \\n\\nSo many have passed down Anduin to find the flowing Sea. \\n\\nAsk of the North Wind news of them the North Wind sends to me!\\' \\n\\n\\'O Boromir! Beyond the gate the seaward road runs south, \\n\\nBut you came not with the wailing gulls from the grey sea\\'s mouth. \\' \\n\\nThen Aragorn sang again: \\n\\nFrom the Gate of Kings the North Wind rides, and past the roaring falls; \\n\\nAnd clear and cold about the tower its loud horn calls. \\n\\n\\'What news from the North, O mighty wind, do you bring to me today? \\n\\nWhat news of Boromir the Bold? For he is long away. \\' \\n\\n\\'Beneath Amon Hen I heard his cry. There many foes he fought. \\n\\nHis cloven shield, his broken sword, they to the water brought. \\n\\nHis head so proud, his face so fair, his limbs they laid to rest; \\n\\nAnd Rauros, golden Rauros-faUs, bore him upon its breast. \\' \\n\\n\\'O Boromir! The Tower of Guard shall ever northward gaze \\nTo Rauros, golden Rauros-falls, until the end of days. \\' \\n\\nSo they ended. Then they turned their boat and drove it with all the \\nspeed they could against the stream back to Parth Galen. \\n\\n\\'You left the East Wind to me,\\' said Gimli, \\'but I will say naught of \\nit.\\' \\n\\n\\'That is as it should be,\\' said Aragorn. \\'In Minas Tirith they endure \\nthe East Wind, but they do not ask it for tidings. But now Boromir has taken \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhis road, and we must make haste to choose our own.\\' \\n\\nHe surveyed the green lawn, quickly but thoroughly, stooping often to \\nthe earth. The Ores have been on this ground,\\' he said. \\'Otherwise nothing \\ncan be made out for certain. All our footprints are here, crossing and \\nre-crossing. I cannot tell whether any of the hobbits have come back since \\nthe search for Frodo began.\\' He returned to the bank, close to where the \\nrill from the spring trickled out into the River. \\'There are some clear \\nprints here,\\' he said. \\'A hobbit waded out into the water and back; but I \\ncannot say how long ago.\\' \\n\\n\\'How then do you read this riddle?\\' asked Gimli. \\n\\nAragorn did not answer at once, but went back to the camping-place and \\nlooked at the baggage. \\'Two packs are missing.\\' he said, \\'and one is \\ncertainly Sam\\'s: it was rather large and heavy. This then is the answer: \\nFrodo has gone by boat, and his servant has gone with him. Frodo must have \\nreturned while we were all away. I met Sam going up the hill and told him to \\nfollow me; but plainly he did not do so. He guessed his master s mind and \\ncame back here before Frodo had gone. He did not find it easy to leave Sam \\nbehind!\\' \\n\\n\\'But why should he leave us behind, and without a word?\\' said Gimli. \\n\\'That was a strange deed!\\' \\n\\n\\'And a brave deed,\\' said Aragorn. \\'Sam was right, I think. Frodo did \\nnot wish to lead any friend to death with him in Mordor. But he knew that he \\nmust go himself. Something happened after he left us that overcame his fear \\nand doubt.\\' \\n\\n\\'Maybe hunting Ores came on him and he fled,\\' said Legolas. \\n\\n\\'He fled, certainly,\\' said Aragorn, \\'but not, I think, from Ores.\\' What \\nhe thought was the cause of Frodo\\'s sudden resolve and flight Aragorn did \\nnot say. The last words of Boromir he long kept secret. \\n\\n\\'Well, so much at least is now clear,\\' said Legolas: \\'Frodo is no \\nlonger on this side of the River: only he can have taken the boat. And Sam \\nis with him; only he would have taken his pack.\\' \\n\\n\\'Our choice then,\\' said Gimli, \\'is either to take the remaining boat \\nand follow Frodo, or else to follow the Ores on foot. There is little hope \\neither way. We have already lost precious hours.\\' \\n\\n\\'Let me think!\\' said Aragorn. \\'And now may I make a right choice and \\nchange the evil fate of this unhappy day!\\' He stood silent for a moment. \\'I \\nwill follow the Ores,\\' he said at last. \\'I would have guided Frodo to Mordor \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand gone with him to the end; but if I seek him now in the wilderness, I \\nmust abandon the captives to torment and death. My heart speaks clearly at \\nlast: the fate of the Bearer is in my hands no longer. The Company has \\nplayed its part. Yet we that remain cannot forsake our companions while we \\nhave strength left. Come! We will go now. Leave all that can be spared \\nbehind! We will press on by day and dark!\\' \\n\\nThey drew up the last boat and carried it to the trees. They laid \\nbeneath it such of their goods as they did not need and could not carry \\naway. Then they left Parth Galen. The afternoon was fading as they came back \\nto the glade where Boromir had fallen. There they picked up the trail of the \\nOres. It needed little skill to find. \\n\\n\\'No other folk make such a trampling,\\' said Legolas. \\'It seems their \\ndelight to slash and beat down growing things that are not even in their \\nway.\\' \\n\\n\\'But they go with a great speed for all that,\\' said Aragorn, \\'and they \\ndo not tire. And later we may have to search for our path in hard bare \\nlands.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, after them!\\' said Gimli. \\'Dwarves too can go swiftly, and they \\ndo not tire sooner than Ores. But it will be a long chase: they have a long \\nstart.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Aragorn, \\'we shall all need the endurance of Dwarves. But \\ncome! With hope or without hope we will follow the trail of our enemies. And \\nwoe to them, if we prove the swifter! We will make such a chase as shall be \\naccounted a marvel among the Three Kindreds p Elves. Dwarves, and Men. \\nForth \\n\\nthe Three Hunters!\\' \\n\\nLike a deer he sprang away. Through the trees he sped. On and on he led \\nthem, tireless and swift, now that his mind was at last made up. The woods \\nabout the lake they left behind. Long slopes they climbed, dark, hard-edged \\nagainst the sky already red with sunset. Dusk came. They passed away, grey \\nshadows in a stony land. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 2 . The Riders of Rohan \\n\\n\\n\\nDusk deepened. Mist lay behind them among the trees below, and brooded \\non the pale margins of the Anduin, but the sky was clear. Stars came out. \\n\\nThe waxing moon was riding in the West, and the shadows of the rocks were \\nblack. They had come to the feet of stony hills, and their pace was slower, \\nfor the trail was no longer easy to follow. Here the highlands of the Emyn \\nMuil ran from North to South in two long tumbled ridges. The western side of \\neach ridge was steep and difficult, but the eastward slopes were gentler, \\nfurrowed with many gullies and narrow ravines. All night the three \\ncompanions scrambled in this bony land, climbing to the crest of the first \\nand tallest ridge, and down again into the darkness of a deep winding valley \\non the other side. \\n\\nThere in the still cool hour before dawn they rested for a brief space. \\n\\nThe moon had long gone down before them, the stars glittered above them; the \\nfirst light of day had not yet come over the dark hills behind. For the \\nmoment Aragorn was at a loss: the ore -trail had descended into the valley, \\nbut there it had vanished. \\n\\n\\'Which way would they turn, do you think?\\' said Legolas. \\'Northward to \\ntake a straighter road to Isengard, or Fangorn, if that is their aim as you \\nguess? Or southward to strike the Entwash?\\' \\n\\n\\'They will not make for the river, whatever mark they aim at\" said \\nAragorn. \\'And unless there is much amiss in Rohan and the power of Saruman \\nis greatly increased; they will take the shortest way that they can find \\nover the fields of the Rohirrim. Fet us search northwards!\\' \\n\\nThe dale ran like a stony trough between the ridged hills, and a \\ntrickling stream flowed among the boulders at the bottom. A cliff frowned \\nupon their right; to their left rose grey slopes, dim and shadowy in the \\nlate night. They went on for a mile or more northwards. Aragorn was \\nsearching, bent towards the ground, among the folds and gullies leading up \\ninto the western ridge. Fegolas was some way ahead. Suddenly the Elf gave a \\ncry and the others came running towards him. \\n\\n\\'We have already overtaken some of those that we are hunting,\\' he said. \\n\\'Eook!\\' He pointed, and they saw that what they had at first taken to be \\nboulders lying at the foot of the slope were huddled bodies. Five dead Ores \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nlay there. They had been hewn with many cruel strokes, and two had been \\nbeheaded. The ground was wet with their dark blood. \\n\\n\\'Here is another riddle!\\' said Gimli. \\'But it needs the light of day \\nand for that we cannot wait.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yet however you read it, it seems not unhopeful,\\' said Legolas. \\n\\n\\'Enemies of the Ores are likely to be our friends. Do any folk dwell in \\nthese hills?\\' \\n\\n\\'No,\\' said Aragorn. \\'The Rohirrim seldom come here, and it is far from \\nMinas Tirith. It might be that some company of Men were hunting here for \\nreasons that we do not know. Yet I think not.\\' \\n\\n\\'What do you think?\\' said Gimli. \\n\\n\\'I think that the enemy brought his own enemy with him,\\' answered \\nAragorn. \\'These are Northern Ores from far away. Among the slain are none of \\nthe great Ores with the strange badges. There was a quarrel, I guess: it is \\nno uncommon thing with these foul folk. Maybe there was some dispute about \\nthe road.\\' \\n\\n\\'Or about the captives,\\' said Gimli. \\'Let us hope that they, too, did \\nnot meet their end here.\\' \\n\\nAragorn searched the ground in a wide circle, but no other traces of \\nthe fight could be found. They went on. Already the eastward sky was turning \\npale; the stars were fading, and a grey light was slowly growing. A little \\nfurther north they came to a fold in which a tiny stream, falling and \\nwinding, had cut a stony path down into the valley. In it some bushes grew, \\nand there were patches of grass upon its sides. \\n\\n\\'At last!\\' said Aragorn. \\'Here are the tracks that we seek! Up this \\nwater -channel: this is the way that the Ores went after their debate.\\' \\n\\nSwiftly now the pursuers turned and followed the new path. As if fresh \\nfrom a night\\'s rest they sprang from stone to stone. At last they reached \\nthe crest of the grey hill, and a sudden breeze blew in their hair and \\nstirred their cloaks: the chill wind of dawn. \\n\\nTurning back they saw across the River the far hills kindled. Day \\nleaped into the sky. The red rim of the sun rose over the shoulders of the \\ndark land. Before them in the West the world lay still, formless and grey; \\nbut even as they looked, the shadows of night melted, the colours of the \\nwaking earth returned: green flowed over the wide meads of Rohan; the white \\nmists shimmered in the watervales; and far off to the left, thirty leagues \\nor more, blue and purple stood the White Mountains, rising into peaks of \\n\\n\\n\\n\\njet, tipped with glimmering snows, flushed with the rose of morning. \\n\\n\\'Gondor! Gondor!\\' cried Aragorn. \\'Would that I looked on you again in \\nhappier hour! Not yet does my road lie southward to your bright streams. \\n\\nGondor! Gondor, between the Mountains and the Sea! \\n\\nWest Wind blew there; the light upon the Silver Tree \\n\\nFell like bright rain in gardens of the Kings of old. \\n\\nO proud walls! White towers! O winged crown and throne of gold! \\n\\nO Gondor, Gondor! Shall Men behold the Silver Tree, \\n\\nOr West Wind blow again between the Mountains and the Sea? \\n\\nNow let us go!\\' he said, drawing his eyes away from the South, and \\nlooking out west and north to the way that he must tread. \\n\\nThe ridge upon which the companions stood went down steeply before \\ntheir feet. Below it twenty fathoms or more, there was a wide and rugged \\nshelf which ended suddenly in the brink of a sheer cliff: the East Wall of \\nRohan. So ended the Emyn Muil, and the green plains of the Rohirrim \\nstretched away before them to the edge of sight. \\n\\n\\'Look!\\' cried Legolas, pointing up into the pale sky above them. \\'There \\nis the eagle again! Ele is very high. He seems to be flying now away, from \\nthis land back to the North. He is going with great speed. Look!\\' \\n\\n\\'No, not even my eyes can see him, my good Legolas,\\' said Aragorn. \\'He \\nmust be far aloft indeed. I wonder what is his errand, if he is the same \\nbird that I have seen before. But look! I can see something nearer at hand \\nand more urgent; there is something moving over the plain!\\' \\n\\n\\'Many things,\\' said Legolas. \\'It is a great company on foot; but I \\ncannot say more, nor see what kind of folk they may be. They are many \\nleagues away: twelve, I guess; but the flatness of the plain is hard to \\nmeasure.\\' \\n\\n\\'I think, nonetheless, that we no longer need any trail to tell us \\nwhich way to go,\\' said Gimli. \\'Let us find a path down to the fields as \\nquick as may be.\\' \\n\\n\\'I doubt if you will find a path quicker than the one that the Ores \\nchose,\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\nThey followed their enemies now by the clear light of day. It seemed \\nthat the Ores had pressed on with all possible speed. Every now and again \\nthe pursuers found things that had been dropped or cast away: food-bags, the \\nrinds and crusts of hard grey bread, a torn black cloak, a heavy iron-nailed \\nshoe broken on the stones. The trail led them north along the top of the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nescarpment, and at length they came to a deep cleft carved in the rock by a \\nstream that splashed noisily down. In the narrow ravine a rough path \\ndescended like a steep stair into the plain. \\n\\nAt the bottom they came with a strange suddenness on the grass of \\nRohan. It swelled like a green sea up to the very foot of the Emyn Muil. The \\nfalling stream vanished into a deep growth of cresses and water-plants, and \\nthey could hear it tinkling away in green tunnels, down long gentle slopes \\ntowards the fens of Entwash Vale far away. They seemed to have left winter \\nclinging to the hills behind. Elere the air was softer and warmer, and \\nfaintly scented, as if spring was already stirring and the sap was flowing \\nagain in herb and leaf. Legolas took a deep breath, like one that drinks a \\ngreat draught after long thirst in barren places. \\n\\n\\'Ah! the green smell!\\' he said. \\'It is better than much sleep. Let us \\nrun!\\' \\n\\n\\'Light feet may run swiftly here,\\' said Aragorn. \\'More swiftly, maybe, \\nthan iron-shod Ores. Now we have a chance to lessen their lead!\\' \\n\\nThey went in single file, running like hounds on a strong scent, and an \\neager light was in their eyes. Nearly due west the broad swath of the \\nmarching Ores tramped its ugly slot; the sweet grass of Rohan had been \\nbruised and blackened as they passed. Presently Aragorn gave a cry and \\nturned aside. \\'Stay!\\' he shouted. \\'Do not follow me yet!\\' He ran quickly to \\nthe right, away from the main trail; for he had seen footprints that went \\nthat way, branching off from the others, the marks of small unshod feet. \\nThese, however, did not go far before they were crossed by ore-prints, also \\ncoming out from the main trail behind and in front, and then they curved \\nsharply back again and were lost in the trampling. At the furthest point \\nAragorn stooped and picked up something from the grass; then he ran back. \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' he said, \\'they are quite plain: a hobbit\\'s footprints. Pippin\\'s \\nI think. He is smaller than the other. And look at this ! He held up a thing \\nthat glittered in the sunlight. It looked like the new-opened leaf of a \\nbeech-tree, fair and strange in that treeless plain. \\n\\n\\'The brooch of an elven-cloak!\\' cried Legolas and Gimli together. \\n\\n\\'Not idly do the leaves of Lurien fall,\\' said Aragorn. \\'This did not \\ndrop by chance: it was cast away as a token to any that might follow. I \\nthink Pippin ran away from the trail for that purpose.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then he at least was alive,\\' said Gimli. \\'And he had the use of his \\nwits, and of his legs too. That is heartening. We do not pursue in vain.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Let us hope that he did not pay too dearly for his boldness,\\' said \\nLegolas. \\'Come! Let us go on! The thought of those merry young folk driven \\nlike cattle burns my heart.\\' \\n\\nThe sun climbed to the noon and then rode slowly down the sky. Light \\nclouds came up out of the sea in the distant South and were blown away upon \\nthe breeze. The sun sank. Shadows rose behind and reached out long arms from \\nthe East. Still the hunters held on. One day now had passed since Boromir \\nfell, and the Ores were yet far ahead. No longer could any sight of them be \\nseen in the level plains. \\n\\nAs nightshade was closing about them Aragorn halted. Only twice in the \\nday\\'s march had they rested for a brief while, and twelve leagues now lay \\nbetween them and the eastern wall where they had stood at dawn. \\n\\n\\'We have come at last to a hard choice,\\' he said. \\'Shall we rest by \\nnight, or shall we go on while our will and strength hold?\\' \\n\\n\\'Unless our enemies rest also, they will leave us far behind, if we \\nstay to sleep.\\' said Legolas. \\'Surely even Ores must pause on the march?\\' \\nsaid Gimli. \\'Seldom will Ores journey in the open under the sun. yet these \\nhave done so,\\' said Legolas. \\'Certainly they will not rest by night.\\' \\n\\n\\'But if we walk by night, we cannot follow their trail,\\' said Gimli. \\n\\n\\'The trail is straight, and turns neither right nor left, as far as my \\neyes can see,\\' said Legolas. \\n\\n\\'Maybe, I could lead you at guess in the darkness and hold to the \\nline,\\' said Aragorn; \\'but if we strayed, or they turned aside, then when \\nlight came there might be long delay before the trail was found again.\\' \\n\\n\\'And there is this also,\\' said Gimli: \\'only by day can we see if any \\ntracks lead away. If a prisoner should escape, or if one should be carried \\noff, eastward, say, to the Great River, towards Mordor, we might pass the \\nsigns and never know it.\\' \\n\\n\\'That is true,\\' said Aragorn. \\'But if I read the signs back yonder \\nrightly, the Ores of the White Hand prevailed, and the whole company is now \\nbound for Isengard. Their present course bears me out.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yet it would be rash to be sure of their counsels,\\' said Gimli. \\'And \\nwhat of escape? In the dark we should have passed the signs that led you to \\nthe brooch.\\' \\n\\n\\'The Ores will be doubly on their guard since then, and the prisoners \\neven wearier,\\' said Legolas. \\'There will be no escape again, if we do not \\ncontrive it. How that is to be done cannot be guessed, but first we must \\n\\n\\n\\n\\novertake them.\\' \\n\\n\\'And yet even I, Dwarf of many journeys, and not the least hardy of my \\nfolk, cannot run all the way to Isengard without any pause \\' said Gimli. \\'My \\nheart burns me too, and I would have started sooner but now I must rest a \\nlittle to run the better. And if we rest, then the blind night is the time \\nto do so.\\' \\n\\n\\'I said that it was a hard choice,\\' said Aragorn. \\'How shall we end \\nthis debate?\\' \\n\\n\\'You are our guide,\\' said Gimli, \\'and you are skilled in the chase. You \\nshall choose.\\' \\n\\n\\'My heart bids me go on,\\' said Legolas. \\'But we must hold together. I \\nwill follow your counsel.\\' \\n\\n\\'You give the choice to an ill chooser,\\' said Aragorn. \\'Since we passed \\nthrough the Argonath my choices have gone amiss.\\' He fell silent gazing \\nnorth and west into the gathering night for a long while. \\n\\n\\'We will not walk in the dark,\\' he said at length. \\'The peril of \\nmissing the trail or signs of other coming and going seems to me the \\ngreater. If the Moon gave enough light, we would use it, but alas ! he sets \\nearly and is yet young and pale.\\' \\n\\n\\'And tonight he is shrouded anyway,\\' Gimli murmured. \\'Would that the \\nLady had given us a light, such a gift as she gave to Frodo!\\' \\n\\n\\'It will be more needed where it is bestowed,\\' said Aragorn. \\'With him \\nlies the true Quest. Ours is but a small matter in the great deeds of this \\ntime. A vain pursuit from its beginning, maybe, which no choice of mine can \\nmar or mend. Well, I have chosen. So let us use the time as best we may!\\' \\n\\nHe cast himself on the ground and fell at once into sleep, for he had \\nnot slept since their night under the shadow of Tol Brandir. Before dawn was \\nin the sky he woke and rose. Gimli was still deep in slumber, but Legolas \\nwas standing, gazing northwards into the darkness, thoughtful and silent as \\na young tree in a windless night. \\n\\n\\'They are far far away,\\' he said sadly, turning to Aragorn. \\'I know in \\nmy heart that they have not rested this night. Only an eagle could overtake \\nthem now.\\' \\n\\n\\'Nonetheless we will still follow as we may,\\' said Aragorn. Stooping he \\nroused the Dwarf. \\'Come! We must go,\\' he said. \\'The scent is growing cold.\\' \\n\\n\\'But it is still dark,\\' said Gimli. \\'Even Legolas on a hill-top could \\nnot see them till the Sun is up.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'I fear they have passed beyond my sight from hill or plain, under moon \\nor sun,\\' said Legolas. \\n\\n\\'Where sight fails the earth may bring us rumour,\\' said Aragorn. \\'The \\nland must groan under their hated feet.\\' He stretched himself upon the \\nground with his ear pressed against the turf. He lay there motionless, for \\nso long a time that Gimli wondered if he had swooned or fallen asleep again. \\nDawn came glimmering, and slowly a grey light grew about them. At last he \\nrose, and now his friends could see his face: it was pale and drawn, and his \\nlook was troubled. \\n\\n\\'The rumour of the earth is dim and confused,\\' he said. \\'Nothing walks \\nupon it for many miles about us. Faint and far are the feet of our enemies. \\n\\nBut loud are the hoofs of the horses. It comes to my mind that I heard them, \\neven as I lay on the ground in sleep, and they troubled my dreams: horses \\ngalloping, passing in the West. But now they are drawing ever further from \\nus, riding northward. I wonder what is happening in this land!\\' \\n\\n\\'Let us go!\\' said Legolas. \\n\\nSo the third day of their pursuit began. During all its long hours of \\ncloud and fitful sun they hardly paused, now striding, now running, as if no \\nweariness could quench the fire that burned them. They seldom spoke. Over \\nthe wide solitude they passed and their elven-cloaks faded against the \\nbackground of the grey -green fields; even in the cool sunlight of mid-day \\nfew but elvish eyes would have marked them, until they were close at hand. \\nOften in their hearts they thanked the Lady of Lurien for the gift of \\nlembas, for they could eat of it and find new strength even as they ran. \\n\\nAll day the track of their enemies led straight on, going north-west \\nwithout a break or turn. As once again the day wore to its end they came to \\nlong treeless slopes, where the land rose, swelling up towards a line of low \\nhumpbacked downs ahead. The ore-trail grew fainter as it bent north towards \\nthem, for the ground became harder and the grass shorter. Far away to the \\nleft the river Entwash wound, a silver thread in a green floor. No moving \\nthing could be seen. Often Aragorn wondered that they saw no sign of beast \\nor man. The dwellings of the Rohirrim were for the most part many leagues \\naway to the South, under the wooded eaves of the White Mountains, now \\nhidden \\n\\nin mist and cloud; yet the Horse-lords had formerly kept many herds and \\nstuds in the Eastemnet, this easterly region of their realm, and there the \\nherdsmen had wandered much, living in camp and tent, even in winter-time. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut now all the land was empty, and there was silence that did not seem to \\nbe the quiet of peace. \\n\\nAt dusk they halted again. Now twice twelve leagues they had passed \\nover the plains of Rohan and the wall of the Emyn Muil was lost in the \\nshadows of the East. The young moon was glimmering in a misty sky, but it \\ngave small light, and the stars were veiled. \\n\\n\\'Now do I most grudge a time of rest or any halt in our chase \\' said \\nLegolas. \\'The Ores have run before us, as if the very whips of Sauron were \\nbehind them. I fear they have already reached the forest and the dark hills, \\nand even now are passing into the shadows of the trees.\\' \\n\\nGimli ground his teeth. \\'This is a bitter end to our hope and to all \\nour toil!\\' he said. \\n\\n\\'To hope, maybe, but not to toil,\\' said Aragorn. \\'We shall not turn \\nback here. Yet I am weary.\\' He gazed back along the way that they had come \\ntowards the night gathering in the East. \\'There is something strange at work \\nin this land. I distrust the silence. I distrust even the pale Moon. The \\nstars are faint; and I am weary as I have seldom been before, weary as no \\nRanger should be with a clear trail to follow. There is some will that lends \\nspeed to our foes and sets an unseen barrier before us: a weariness that is \\nin the heart more than in the limb.\\' \\n\\n\\'Truly!\\' said Legolas. \\'That I have known since first we came down from \\nthe Emyn Muil. For the will is not behind us but before us.\\' He pointed away \\nover the land of Rohan into the darkling West under the sickle moon. \\n\\'Saruman!\\' muttered Aragorn. \\'But he shall not turn us back! Halt we must \\nonce more; for, see! even the Moon is falling into gathering cloud. But \\nnorth lies our road between down and fen when day returns.\\' \\n\\nAs before Legolas was first afoot, if indeed he had ever slept. \\'Awake! \\nAwake!\\' he cried. \\'It is a red dawn. Strange things await us by the eaves of \\nthe forest. Good or evil, I do not know; but we are called. Awake!\\' \\n\\nThe others sprang up, and almost at once they set off again. Slowly the \\ndowns drew near. It was still an hour before noon when they reached them: \\ngreen slopes rising to bare ridges that ran in a line straight towards the \\nNorth. At their feet the ground was dry and the turf short, but a long strip \\nof sunken land, some ten miles wide, lay between them and the river \\nwandering deep in dim thickets of reed and rush. Just to the West of the \\nsouthernmost slope there was a great ring, where the turf had been torn and \\nbeaten by many trampling feet. From it the ore-trail ran out again, turning \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnorth along the dry skirts of the hills. Aragorn halted and examined the \\ntracks closely. \\n\\nThey rested here a while,\\' he said, \\'but even the outward trail is \\nalready old. I fear that your heart spoke truly, Legolas: it is thrice \\ntwelve hours, I guess, since the Ores stood where we now stand. If they held \\nto their pace, then at sundown yesterday they would reach the borders of \\nFangorn.\\' \\n\\n\\'I can see nothing away north or west but grass dwindling into mist,\\' \\nsaid Gimli. \\'Could we see the forest, if we climbed the hills?\\' \\n\\n\\'It is still far away,\\' said Aragorn. \\'If I remember rightly, these \\ndowns run eight leagues or more to the north, and then north-west to the \\nissuing of the Entwash there lies still a wide land, another fifteen leagues \\nit may be.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, let us go on,\\' said Gimli. \\'My legs must forget the miles. They \\nwould be more willing, if my heart were less heavy.\\' \\n\\nThe sun was sinking when at last they drew near to the end of the line \\nof downs. For many hours they had marched without rest. They were going \\nslowly now, and Gimli\\' s back was bent. Stone-hard are the Dwarves in labour \\nor journey, but this endless chase began to tell on him, as all hope failed \\nin his heart. Aragorn walked behind him, grim and silent, stooping now and \\nagain to scan some print or mark upon the ground. Only Legolas still stepped \\nas lightly as ever, his feet hardly seeming to press the grass, leaving no \\nfootprints as he passed; but in the waybread of the Elves he found all the \\nsustenance that he needed, and he could sleep, if sleep it could be called \\nby Men, resting his mind in the strange paths of elvish dreams, even as he \\nwalked open-eyed in the light of this world. \\n\\n\\'Let us go up on to this green hill!\\' he said. Wearily they followed \\nhim, climbing the long slope, until they came out upon the top. It was a \\nround hill smooth and bare, standing by itself, the most northerly of the \\ndowns. The sun sank and the shadows of evening fell like a curtain. They \\nwere alone in a grey formless world without mark or measure. Only far away \\nnorth-west there was a deeper darkness against the dying light: the \\nMountains of Mist and the forest at their feet. \\n\\n\\'Nothing can we see to guide us here,\\' said Gimli. \\'Well, now we must \\nhalt again and wear the night away. It is growing cold!\\' \\n\\n\\'The wind is north from the snows,\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\n\\'And ere morning it will be in the East,\\' said Legolas. \\'But rest if \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyou must. Yet do not cast all hope away. Tomorrow is unknown. Rede oft is \\nfound at the rising of the Sun.\\' \\n\\n\\'Three suns already have risen on our chase and brought no counsel \\' \\nsaid Gimli. \\n\\nThe night grew ever colder. Aragorn and Gimli slept fitfully, and \\nwhenever they awoke they saw Legolas standing beside them, or walking to \\nand \\n\\nfro, singing softly to himself in his own tongue, and as he sang the white \\nstars opened in the hard black vault above. So the night passed. Together \\nthey watched the dawn grow slowly in the sky, now bare and cloudless, until \\nat last the sunrise came. It was pale and clear. The wind was in the East \\nand all the mists had rolled away; wide lands lay bleak about them in the \\nbitter light. \\n\\nAhead and eastward they saw the windy uplands of the Wold of Rohan that \\nthey had already glimpsed many days ago from the Great River. North- \\nwestward \\n\\nstalked the dark forest of Fangorn; still ten leagues away stood its shadowy \\neaves, and its further slopes faded into the distant blue. Beyond there \\nglimmered far away, as if floating on a grey cloud, the white head of tall \\nMethedras, the last peak of the Misty Mountains. Out of the forest the \\nEntwash flowed to meet them, its stream now swift and narrow, and its banks \\ndeep-cloven. The ore-trail turned from the downs towards it. \\n\\nFollowing with his keen eyes the trail to the river, and then the river \\nback towards the forest, Aragorn saw a shadow on the distant green, a dark \\nswift-moving blur. He cast himself upon the ground and listened again \\nintently. But Legolas stood beside him, shading his bright elven-eyes with \\nhis long slender hand, and he saw not a shadow, nor a blur, but the small \\nfigures of horsemen, many horsemen, and the glint of morning on the tips of \\ntheir spears was like the twinkle of minute stars beyond the edge of mortal \\nsight. Far behind them a dark smoke rose in thin curling threads. \\n\\nThere was a silence in the empty fields, arid Gimli could hear the air \\nmoving in the grass. \\n\\n\\'Riders!\\' cried Aragorn, springing to his feet. \\'Many riders on swift \\nsteeds are coming towards us!\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Legolas, \\'there are one hundred and five. Yellow is their \\nhair, and bright are their spears. Their leader is very tall.\\' \\n\\nAragorn smiled. \\'Keen are the eyes of the Elves,\\' he said. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Nay! The riders are little more than five leagues distant,\\' said \\nLegolas. \\n\\n\\'Five leagues or one,\\' said Gimli; \\'we cannot escape them in this bare \\nland. Shall we wait for them here or go on our way?\\' \\n\\n\\'We will wait,\\' said Aragorn. \\'I am weary, and our hunt has failed. Or \\nat least others were before us; for these horsemen are riding back down the \\nore -trail. We may get new s from them.\\' \\n\\n\\'Or spears,\\' said Gimli. \\n\\n\\'There are three empty saddles, but I see no hobbits,\\' said Legolas. \\n\\n\\'I did not say that we should hear good news,\\' said Aragorn. \\'But evil \\nor good we will await it here.\\' \\n\\nThe three companions now left the hill-top, where they might be an easy \\nmark against the pale sky, and they walked slowly down the northward slope. \\nA little above the hill\\'s foot they halted, and wrapping their cloaks about \\nthem, they sat huddled together upon the faded grass. The time passed slowly \\nand heavily. The wind was thin and searching. Gimli was uneasy. \\n\\n\\'What do you know of these horsemen, Aragorn?\\' he said. \\'Do we sit here \\nwaiting for sudden death?\\' \\n\\n\\'I have been among them,\\' answered Aragorn. \\'They are proud and wilful, \\nbut they are true-hearted, generous in thought and deed; bold but not cruel; \\nwise but unlearned, writing no books but singing many songs, after the \\nmanner of the children of Men before the Dark Years. But I do not know what \\nhas happened here of late, nor in what mind the Rohirrim may now be between \\nthe traitor Saruman and the threat of Sauron. They have long been the \\nfriends of the people of Gondor, though they are not akin to them. It was in \\nforgotten years long ago that Eorl the Young brought them out of the North, \\nand their kinship is rather with the Bardings of Dale, and with the \\nBeornings of the Wood, among whom may still be seen many men tall and \\nfair, \\n\\nas are the Riders of Rohan. At least they will not love the Ores.\\' \\n\\n\\'But Gandalf spoke of a rumour that they pay tribute to Mordor \\' said \\nGimli. \\n\\n\\'I believe it no more than did Boromir,\\' answered Aragorn. \\n\\n\\'You will soon learn the truth,\\' said Legolas. \\'Already they approach.\\' \\n\\nAt length even Gimli could hear the distant beat of galloping hoofs. \\n\\nThe horsemen, following the trail, had turned from the river, and were \\ndrawing near the downs. They were riding like the wind. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow the cries of clear strong voices came ringing over the fields. \\nSuddenly they swept up with a noise like thunder, and the foremost horseman \\nswerved, passing by the foot of the hill, and leading the host back \\nsouthward along the western skirts of the downs. After him they rode: a long \\nline of mail-clad men. swift, shining, fell and fair to look upon. \\n\\nTheir horses were of great stature, strong and clean-limbed; their grey \\ncoats glistened, their long tails flowed in the wind, their manes were \\nbraided on their proud necks. The Men that rode them matched them well: tall \\nand long-limbed; their hair, flaxen-pale, flowed under their light helms, \\nand streamed in long braids behind them; their faces were stern and keen. In \\ntheir hands were tall spears of ash, painted shields were slung at their \\nbacks, long swords were at their belts, their burnished skirts of mail hung \\ndown upon their knees. \\n\\nIn pairs they galloped by, and though every now and then one rose in \\nhis stirrups and gazed ahead and to either side, they appeared not to \\nperceive the three strangers sitting silently and watching them. The host \\nhad almost passed when suddenly Aragorn stood up, and called in a loud \\nvoice: \\n\\n\\'What news from the North, Riders of Rohan?\\' \\n\\nWith astonishing speed and skill they checked their steeds, wheeled, \\nand came charging round. Soon the three companions found themselves in a \\nring of horsemen moving in a running circle, up the hill-slope behind them \\nand down, round and round them, and drawing ever inwards. Aragorn stood \\nsilent, and the other two sat without moving, wondering what way things \\nwould turn. \\n\\nWithout a word or cry, suddenly, the Riders halted. A thicket of spears \\nwere pointed towards the strangers; and some of the horsemen had bows in \\nhand, and their arrows were already fitted to the string. Then one rode \\nforward, a tall man, taller than all the rest; from his helm as a crest a \\nwhite horsetail flowed. He advanced until the point of his spear was within \\na foot of Aragorn\\'s breast. Aragorn did not stir. \\n\\n\\'Who are you, and what are you doing in this land?\\' said the Rider, \\nusing the Common Speech of the West, in manner and tone like to the speech \\nof Boromir, Man of Gondor. \\n\\n\\'I am called Strider,\\' answered Aragorn. \\'I came out of the North. I am \\nhunting Ores.\\' \\n\\nThe Rider leaped from his horse. Giving his spear to another who rode \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nup and dismounted at his side, he drew his sword and stood face to face with \\nAragorn, surveying him keenly, and not without wonder. At length he spoke \\nagain. \\n\\n\\'At first I thought that you yourselves were Ores,\\' he said; \\'but now I \\nsee that it is not so. Indeed you know little of Ores, if you go hunting \\nthem in this fashion. They were swift and well-armed, and they were many. \\nYou would have changed from hunters to prey, if ever you had overtaken them. \\nBut there is something strange about you, Strider.\\' He bent his clear bright \\neyes again upon the Ranger. \\'That is no name for a Man that you give. And \\nstrange too is your raiment. Have you sprung out of the grass? How did you \\nescape our sight? Are you elvish folk?\\' \\n\\n\\'No,\\' said Aragorn. \\'One only of us is an Elf, Legolas from the \\nWoodland Realm in distant Mirkwood. But we have passed through \\nLothlurien, \\n\\nand the gifts and favour of the Lady go with us.\\' \\n\\nThe Rider looked at them with renewed wonder, but his eyes hardened. \\n\\'Then there is a Lady in the Golden Wood, as old tales tell!\\' he said. \\'Lew \\nescape her nets, they say. These are strange days ! But if you have her \\nfavour, then you also are net-weavers and sorcerers, maybe.\\' He turned a \\ncold glance suddenly upon Legolas and Gimli. \\'Why do you not speak, silent \\nones?\\' he demanded. \\n\\nGimli rose and planted his feet firmly apart: his hand gripped the \\nhandle of his axe, and his dark eyes flashed. \\'Give me your name, \\nhorse-master, and I will give you mine, and more besides,\\' he said. \\n\\n\\'As for that,\\' said the Rider, staring down at the Dwarf, \\'the stranger \\nshould declare himself first. Yet I am named Jomer son of Jomund, and am \\ncalled the Third Marshal of Riddermark.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then Jomer son of Jomund, Third Marshal of Riddermark, let Gimli the \\nDwarf Gluin\\'s son warn you against foolish words. You speak evil of that \\nwhich is fair beyond the reach of your thought, and only little wit can \\nexcuse you.\\' \\n\\nJomer\\'s eyes blazed, and the Men of Rohan murmured angrily, and closed \\nin, advancing their spears. \\'I would cut off your head, beard and all, \\n\\nMaster Dwarf, if it stood but a little higher from the ground \\' said Jomer. \\n\\n\\'He stands not alone,\\' said Legolas, bending his bow and fitting an \\narrow with hands that moved quicker than sight. \\'You would die before your \\nstroke fell.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJomer raised his sword, and things might have gone ill, but Aragorn \\nsprang between them, and raised his hand. \\'Your pardon, Jomer!\\' he cried. \\n\\'When you know more you will understand why you have angered my \\ncompanions. \\n\\nWe intend no evil to Rohan, nor to any of its folk, neither to man nor to \\nhorse. Will you not hear our tale before you strike?\\' \\n\\n\\'I will,\\' said Jomer lowering his blade. \\'But wanderers in the \\nRiddermark would be wise to be less haughty in these days of doubt. First \\ntell me your right name.\\' \\n\\n\\'First tell me whom you serve,\\' said Aragorn. \\'Are you friend or foe of \\nSauron, the Dark Lord of Mordor?\\' \\n\\n\\'I serve only the Lord of the Mark, Thjoden King son of Thengel,\\' \\nanswered Jomer. \\'We do not serve the Power of the Black Land far away, but \\nneither are we yet at open war with him; and if you are fleeing from him, \\nthen you had best leave this land. There is trouble now on all our borders, \\nand we are threatened; but we desire only to be free, and to live as we have \\nlived, keeping our own, and serving no foreign lord, good or evil. We \\nwelcomed guests kindly in the better days, but in these times the unbidden \\nstranger finds us swift and hard. Come! Who are you? Whom do you serve? \\nAt \\n\\nwhose command do you hunt Ores in our land?\\' \\n\\n\\'I serve no man,\\' said Aragorn; \\'but the servants of Sauron I pursue \\ninto whatever land they may go. There are few among mortal Men who know \\nmore \\n\\nof Ores; and I do not hunt them in this fashion out of choice. The Ores whom \\nwe pursued took captive two of my friends. In such need a man that has no \\nhorse will go on foot, and he will not ask for leave to follow the trail. \\n\\nNor will he count the heads of the enemy save with a sword. I am not \\nweaponless.\\' \\n\\nAragorn threw back his cloak. The elven-sheath glittered as he grasped \\nit, and the bright blade of And(r)ril shone like a sudden flame as he swept it \\nout. \\'Elendil!\\' he cried. \\'I am Aragorn son of Arathorn and am called \\nElessar, the Elfstone, D(r)nadan, the heir of Isildur Elendil\\'s son of Gondor. \\nHere is the Sword that was Broken and is forged again! Will you aid me or \\nthwart me? Choose swiftly!\\' \\n\\nGimli and Legolas looked at their companion in amazement, for they had \\nnot seen him in this mood before. He seemed to have grown in stature while \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJomer had shrunk; and in his living face they caught a brief vision of the \\npower and majesty of the kings of stone. For a moment it seemed to the eyes \\nof Legolas that a white flame flickered on the brows of Aragorn like a \\nshining crown. \\n\\nJomer stepped back and a look of awe was in his face. He cast down his \\nproud eyes. These are indeed strange days,\\' he muttered. \\'Dreams and \\nlegends spring to life out of the grass. \\n\\nTell me, lord,\\' he said, \\'what brings you here? And what was the \\nmeaning of the dark words? Long has Boromir son of Denethor been gone \\nseeking an answer, and the horse that we lent him came back riderless. What \\ndoom do you bring out of the North?\\' \\n\\n\\'The doom of choice,\\' said Aragorn. \\'You may say this to Thjoden son of \\nThengel: open war lies before him, with Sauron or against him. None may live \\nnow as they have lived, and few shall keep what they call their own. But of \\nthese great matters we will speak later. If chance allows, I will come \\nmyself to the king. Now I am in great need, and I ask for help, or at least \\nfor tidings. You heard that we are pursuing an ore-host that carried off our \\nfriends. What can you tell us?\\' \\n\\n\\'That you need not pursue them further,\\' said Jomer. \\'The Ores are \\ndestroyed.\\' \\n\\n\\'And our friends?\\' \\n\\n\\'We found none but Ores.\\' \\n\\n\\'But that is strange indeed,\\' said Aragorn. \\'Did you search the slain? \\n\\nWere there no bodies other than those of ore -kind? They would be small. Only \\nchildren to your eyes, unshod but clad in grey.\\' \\n\\n\\'There were no dwarves nor children,\\' said Jomer. \\'We counted all the \\nslain and despoiled them, and then we piled the carcases and burned them, as \\nis our custom. The ashes are smoking still.\\' \\n\\n\\'We do not speak of dwarves or children,\\' said Gimli. \\'Our friends were \\nhobbits.\\' \\n\\n\\'Hobbits?\\' said Jomer. \\'And what may they be? It is a strange name.\\' \\n\\n\\'A strange name for a strange folk,\\' said Gimli. \\'But these were very \\ndear to us. It seems that you have heard in Rohan of the words that troubled \\nMinas Tirith. They spoke of the Halfling. These hobbits are Halflings.\\' \\n\\n\\'Halflings!\\' laughed the Rider that stood beside Jomer. \\'Halflings! But \\nthey are only a little people in old songs and children\\'s tales out of the \\nNorth. Do we walk in legends or on the green earth in the daylight?\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'A man may do both,\\' said Aragorn. \\'For not we but those who come after \\nwill make the legends of our time. The green earth, say you? That is a \\nmighty matter of legend, though you tread it under the light of day!\\' \\n\\nTime is pressing,\\' said the Rider, not heeding Aragorn. \\'We must \\nhasten south, lord. Let us leave these wild folk to their fancies. Or let us \\nbind them and take them to the king.\\' \\n\\n\\'Peace, Jothain!\\' said Jomer in his own tongue. \\'Leave me a while. Tell \\nthe jored to assemble on the path\\' and make ready to ride to the Entwade.\\' \\n\\nMuttering Jothain retired, and spoke to the others. Soon they drew off \\nand left Jomer alone with the three companions. \\n\\n\\'All that you say is strange, Aragorn.\\' he said. \\'Yet you speak the \\ntruth, that is plain: the Men of the Mark do not lie, and therefore they are \\nnot easily deceived. But you have not told all. Will you not now speak more \\nfully of your errand, so that I may judge what to do?\\' \\n\\n\\'I set out from Imladris, as it is named in the rhyme, many weeks ago,\\' \\nanswered Aragorn. \\'With me went Boromir of Minas Tirith. My errand was to \\ngo \\n\\nto that city with the son of Denethor, to aid his folk in their war against \\nSauron. But the Company that I journeyed with had other business. Of that I \\ncannot speak now. Gandalf the Grey was our leader.\\' \\n\\n\\'Gandalf !\\' Jomer exclaimed. \\'Gandalf Greyhame is known in the Mark: but \\nhis name, I warn you, is no longer a password to the king\\'s favour. He has \\nbeen a guest in the land many times in the memory of men, coming as he will, \\nafter a season, or after many years. He is ever the herald of strange \\nevents: a bringer of evil, some now say. \\n\\n\\'Indeed since his last coming in the summer all things have gone amiss. \\n\\nAt that time our trouble with Saruman began. Until then we counted Saruman \\nour friend, hut Gandalf came then and warned us that sudden war was \\npreparing in Isengard. He said that he himself had been a prisoner in \\nOrthanc and had hardly escaped, and he begged for help. But Thjoden would \\nnot listen to him, and he went away. Speak not the name of Gandalf loudly in \\nThj oden\\'s ears! He is wroth. For Gandalf took the horse that is called \\nShadowfax, the most precious of all the king\\'s steeds, chief of the Mearas, \\nwhich only the Lord of the Mark may ride. For the sire of their race was the \\ngreat horse of Eorl that knew the speech of Men. Seven nights ago Shadowfax \\nreturned; but the king\\'s anger is not less, for now the horse is wild and \\nwill let no man handle him.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Then Shadowfax has found his way alone from the far North,\\' said \\nAragorn; \\'for it was there that he and Gandalf parted. But alas! Gandalf \\nwill ride no longer. He fell into darkness in the Mines of Moria and comes \\nnot again.\\' \\n\\n\\'That is heavy tidings,\\' said Jomer. \\'At least to me, and to many; \\nthough not to all, as you may find, if you come to the king.\\' \\n\\n\\'It is tidings more grievous than any in this land can understand, \\nthough it may touch them sorely ere the year is much older,\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\'But when the great fall, the less must lead. My part it has been to guide \\nour Company on the long road from Moria. Through Lurien we came -- of \\nwhich \\n\\nit were well that you should learn the truth ere you speak of it again -- \\nand thence down the leagues of the Great River to the falls of Rauros. There \\nBoromir was slain by the same Ores whom you destroyed.\\' \\n\\n\\'Your news is all of woe!\\' cried Jomer in dismay. \\'Great harm is this \\ndeath to Minas Tirith, and to us all. That was a worthy man! All spoke his \\npraise. He came seldom to the Mark, for he was ever in the wars on the \\nEast -borders; but I have seen him. More like to the swift sons of Eorl than \\nto the grave Men of Gondor he seemed to me, and likely to prove a great \\ncaptain of his people when his time came. But we have had no word of this \\ngrief out of Gondor. When did he fall?\\' \\n\\n\\'It is now the fourth day since he was slain,\\' answered Aragorn, \\'and \\nsince the evening of that day we have journeyed from the shadow of Tol \\nBrandir.\\' \\n\\n\\'On foot?\\' cried Jomer. \\n\\n\\'Yes, even as you see us.\\' \\n\\nWide wonder came into Jomer\\'s eyes. \\'Strider is too poor a name, son of \\nArathorn,\\' he said. \\'Wingfoot I name you. This deed of the three friends \\nshould be sung in many a hall. Forty leagues and five you have measured ere \\nthe fourth day is ended! Hardy is the race of Elendil! \\n\\n\\'But now, lord, what would you have me do! I must return in haste to \\nThjoden. I spoke warily before my men. It is true that we are not yet at \\nopen war with the Black Land, and there are some, close to the king\\'s ear, \\nthat speak craven counsels; but war is coming. We shall not forsake our old \\nalliance with Gondor, and while they fight we shall aid them: so say I and \\nall who hold with me. The East-mark is my charge, the ward of the Third \\nMarshal, and I have removed all our herds and herdfolk, withdrawing them \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbeyond Entwash, and leaving none here but guards and swift scouts.\\' \\n\\nThen you do not pay tribute to Sauron?\\' said Gimli. \\n\\n\\'We do not and we never have.\\' said Jomer with a flash of his eyes; \\n\\'though it comes to my ears that that lie has been told. Some years ago the \\nLord of the Black Land wished to purchase horses of us at great price, but \\nwe refused him. for he puts beasts to evil use. Then he sent plundering \\nOres, and they carry off what they can, choosing always the black horses: \\nfew of these are now left. Lor that reason our feud with the Ores is bitter. \\n\\n\\'But at this time our chief concern is with Saruman. He has claimed \\nlordship over all this land, and there has been war between us for many \\nmonths. He has taken Ores into his service, and Wolf-riders, and evil Men, \\nand he has closed the Gap against us, so that we are likely to be beset both \\neast and west. \\n\\n\\'It is ill dealing with such a foe: he is a wizard both cunning and \\ndwimmer -crafty, having many guises. He walks here and there, they say, as an \\nold man hooded and cloaked, very like to Gandalf, as many now recall. His \\nspies slip through every net, and his birds of ill omen are abroad in the \\nsky. I do not know how it will all end, and my heart misgives me; for it \\nseems to me that his friends do not all dwell in Isengard. But if you come \\nto the king\\'s house, you shall see for yourself. Will you not come? Do I \\nhope in vain that you have been sent to me for a help in doubt and need?\\' \\n\\n\\'I will come when I may,\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\n\\'Come now!\\' said Jomer. \\'The Heir of Elendil would be a strength indeed \\nto the Sons of Eorl in this evil tide. There is battle even now upon the \\nWestemnet, and I fear that it may go ill for us. \\n\\n\\'Indeed in this riding north I went without the king\\'s leave, for in my \\nabsence his house is left with little guard. But scouts warned me of the \\nore-host coming down out of the East Wall three nights ago, and among them \\nthey reported that some bore the white badges of Saruman. So suspecting what \\nI most fear, a league between Orthanc and the Dark Tower, I led forth my \\njored , men of my own household; and we overtook the Ores at nightfall two \\ndays ago, near to the borders of the Entwood. There we surrounded them, and \\ngave battle yesterday at dawn. Fifteen of my men I lost, and twelve horses \\nalas! For the Ores were greater in number than we counted on. Others joined \\nthem, coming out of the East across the Great River: their trail is plain to \\nsee a little north of this spot. And others, too, came out of the forest. \\n\\nGreat Ores, who also bore the White Hand of Isengard: that kind is stronger \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand more fell than all others. \\n\\n\\'Nonetheless we put an end to them. But we have been too long away. We \\nare needed south and west. Will you not come? There are spare horses as you \\nsee. There is work for the Sword to do. Yes, and we could find a use for \\nGimli\\'s axe and the bow of Legolas, if they will pardon my rash words \\nconcerning the Lady of the Wood. I spoke only as do all men in my land, and \\nI would gladly learn better.\\' \\n\\n\\'I thank you for your fair words,\\' said Aragorn, \\'and my heart desires \\nto come with you; but I cannot desert my friends while hope remains.\\' \\n\\n\\'Hope does not remain,\\' said Jomer. \\'You will not find your friends on \\nthe North-borders.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yet my friends are not behind. We found a clear token not far from the \\nEast Wall that one at least of them was still alive there. But between the \\nwall and the downs we have found no other trace of them, and no trail has \\nturned aside, this way or that, unless my skill has wholly left me.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then what do you think has become of them?\\' \\n\\n\\'I do not know. They may have been slain and burned among the Ores; but \\nthat you will say cannot be, and I do not fear it. I can only think that \\nthey were carried off into the forest before the battle, even before you \\nencircled your foes, maybe. Can you swear that none escaped your net in such \\na way?\\' \\n\\n\\'I would swear that no Ore escaped after we sighted them,\\' said Jomer. \\n\\n\\'We reached the forest-eaves before them, and if after that any living thing \\nbroke through our ring, then it was no Ore and had some elvish power.\\' \\n\\n\\'Our friends were attired even as we are,\\' said Aragorn; \\'and you \\npassed us by under the full light of day.\\' \\n\\n\\'I had forgotten that,\\' said Jomer. \\'It is hard to be sure of anything \\namong so many marvels. The world is all grown strange. Elf and Dwarf in \\ncompany walk in our daily fields; and folk speak with the Lady of the Wood \\nand yet live; and the Sword comes back to war that was broken in the long \\nages ere the fathers of our fathers rode into the Mark! How shall a man \\njudge what to do in such times?\\' \\n\\n\\'As he ever has judged,\\' said Aragorn. \\'Good and ill have not changed \\nsince yesteryear; nor are they one thing among Elves and Dwarves p and \\nanother among Men. It is a man\\'s part to discern them, as much in the Golden \\nWood as in his own house.\\' \\n\\n\\'True indeed,\\' said Jomer. \\'But I do not doubt you, nor the deed which \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmy heart would do. Yet I am not free to do all as I would. It is against our \\nlaw to let strangers wander at will in our land, until the king himself \\nshall give them leave, and more strict is the command in these days of \\nperil. I have begged you to come back willingly with me, and you will not. \\nLoth am I to begin a battle of one hundred against three.\\' \\n\\n\\'I do not think your law was made for such a chance,\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\n\\'Nor indeed am I a stranger; for I have been in this land before, more than \\nonce, and ridden with the host of the Rohirrim, though under other name and \\nin other guise. You I have not seen before, for you are young, but I have \\nspoken with Jomund your father, and with Thjoden son of Thengel. Never in \\nformer days would any high lord of this land have constrained a man to \\nabandon such a quest as mine. My duty at least is clear, to go on. Come now, \\nson of Jomund, the choice must be made at last. Aid us, or at the worst let \\nus go free. Or seek to carry out your law. If you do so there will be fewer \\nto return to your war or to your king.\\' \\n\\nJomer was silent for a moment, then he spoke. \\'We both have need of \\nhaste,\\' he said. \\'My company chafes to be away, and every hour lessens your \\nhope. This is my choice. You may go; and what is more, I will lend you \\nhorses. This only I ask: when your quest is achieved, or is proved vain, \\nreturn with the horses over the Entwade to Meduseld, the high house in \\nEdoras where Thjoden now sits. Thus you shall prove to him that I have not \\nmisjudged. In this I place myself, and maybe my very life, in the keeping of \\nyour good faith. Do not fail.\\' \\n\\n\\'I will not,\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\nThere was great wonder, and many dark and doubtful glances, among his \\nmen, when Jomer gave orders that the spare horses were to be lent to the \\nstrangers; but only Jothain dared to speak openly. \\n\\n\\'It may be well enough for this lord of the race of Gondor, as he \\nclaims,\\' he said, \\'but who has heard of a horse of the Mark being given to a \\nDwarf?\\' \\n\\n\\'No one,\\' said Gimli. \\'And do not trouble: no one will ever hear of it. \\n\\nI would sooner walk than sit on the back of any beast so great, free or \\nbegrudged.\\' \\n\\n\\'But you must ride now, or you will hinder us,\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\n\\'Come, you shall sit behind me, friend Gimli, said Legolas. Then all \\nwill be well, and you need neither borrow a horse nor be troubled by one.\\' \\n\\nA great dark-grey horse was brought to Aragorn, and he mounted it. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Hasufel is his name,\\' said Jomer. \\'May he bear you well and to better \\nfortune than Gbrulf, his late master!\\' \\n\\nA smaller and lighter horse, but restive and fiery, was brought to \\nLegolas. Arod was his name. But Legolas asked them to take off saddle and \\nrein. \\'I need them not,\\' he said, and leaped lightly up, and to their wonder \\nArod was tame and willing beneath him, moving here and there with but a \\nspoken word: such was the elvish way with all good beasts. Gimli was lifted \\nup behind his friend, and he clung to him, not much more at ease than Sam \\nGamgee in a boat. \\n\\n\\'Farewell, and may you find what you seek!\\' cried Jomer. \\'Return with \\nwhat speed you may, and let our swords hereafter shine together!\\' \\n\\n\\'I will come,\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\n\\'And I will come, too,\\' said Gimli. \\'The matter of the Lady Galadriel \\nlies still between us. I have yet to teach you gentle speech. \\' \\n\\n\\'We shall see,\\' said Jomer. \\'So many strange things have chanced that \\nto learn the praise of a fair lady under the loving strokes of a Dwarfs axe \\nwill seem no great wonder. Farewell!\\' \\n\\nWith that they parted. Very swift were the horses of Rohan. When after \\na little Gimli looked back, the company of Jomer were already small and far \\naway. Aragorn did not look back: he was watching the trail as they sped on \\ntheir way, bending low with his head beside the neck of Hasufel. Before long \\nthey came to the borders of the Entwash, and there they met the other trail \\nof which Jomer had spoken, coming down from the East out of the Wold. \\n\\nAragorn dismounted and surveyed the ground, then leaping back into the \\nsaddle, he rode away for some distance eastward, keeping to one side and \\ntaking care not to override the footprints. Then he again dismounted and \\nexamined the ground, going backwards and forwards on foot. \\n\\n\\'There is little to discover,\\' he said when he returned. \\'The main \\ntrail is all confused with the passage of the horsemen as they came back; \\ntheir outward course must have lain nearer the river. But this eastward \\ntrail is fresh and clear. There is no sign there of any feet going the other \\nway, back towards Anduin. Now we must ride slower, and make sure that no \\ntrace or footstep branches off on either side. The Ores must have been aware \\nfrom this point that they were pursued; they may have made some attempt to \\nget their captives away before they were overtaken.\\' \\n\\nAs they rode forward the day was overcast. Low grey clouds came over \\nthe Wold. A mist shrouded the sun. Ever nearer the tree-clad slopes of \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFangorn loomed, slowly darkling as the sun went west. They saw no sign of \\nany trail to right or left, but here and there they passed single Ores, \\nfallen in their tracks as they ran, with grey -feathered arrows sticking in \\nback or throat. \\n\\nAt last as the afternoon was waning they came to the eaves of the \\nforest, and in an open glade among the first trees they found the place of \\nthe great burning: the ashes were still hot and smoking. Beside it was a \\ngreat pile of helms and mail, cloven shields, and broken swords, bows and \\ndarts and other gear of war. Upon a stake in the middle was set a great \\ngoblin head; upon its shattered helm the white badge could still be seen. \\nFurther away, not far from the river, where it came streaming out from the \\nedge of the wood, there was a mound. It was newly raised: the raw earth was \\ncovered with fresh-cut turves: about it were planted fifteen spears. \\n\\nAragorn and his companions searched far and wide about the field of \\nbattle, but the light faded, and evening soon drew down, dim and misty. By \\nnightfall they had discovered no trace of Merry and Pippin. \\n\\n\\'We can do no more,\\' said Gimli sadly. \\'We have been set many riddles \\nsince we came to Tol Brandir, but this is the hardest to unravel. I would \\nguess that the burned bones of the hobbits are now mingled with the Ores\\'. \\n\\nIt will be hard news for Frodo, if he lives to hear it; and hard too for the \\nold hobbit who waits in Rivendell. Elrond was against their coming.\\' \\n\\n\\'But Gandalf was not,\\' said Legolas. \\n\\n\\'But Gandalf chose to come himself, and he was the first to be lost \\' \\nanswered Gimli. \\'His foresight failed him.\\' \\n\\n\\'The counsel of Gandalf was not founded on foreknowledge of safety, for \\nhimself or for others,\\' said Aragorn. \\'There are some things that it is \\nbetter to begin than to refuse, even though the end may be dark. But I shall \\nnot depart from this place yet. In any case we must here await the \\nmorning -light.\\' \\n\\nA little way beyond the battle-field they made their camp under a \\nspreading tree: it looked like a chestnut, and yet it still bore many broad \\nbrown leaves of a former year, like dry hands with long splayed fingers; \\nthey rattled mournfully in the night-breeze. \\n\\nGimli shivered. They had brought only one blanket apiece. \\'Let us light \\na fire,\\' he said. \\'I care no longer for the danger. Let the Ores come as \\nthick as summer-moths round a candle!\\' \\n\\n\\'If those unhappy hobbits are astray in the woods, it might draw them \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhither,\\' said Legolas. \\n\\n\\'And it might draw other things, neither Ore nor Hobbit,\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\n\\'We are near to the mountain-marches of the traitor Saruman. Also we are on \\nthe very edge of Fangorn, and it is perilous to touch the trees of that \\nwood, it is said.\\' \\n\\n\\'But the Rohirrim made a great burning here yesterday,\\' said Gimli, \\n\\n\\'and they felled trees for the fire, as can be seen. Yet they passed the \\nnight after safely here, when their labour was ended.\\' \\n\\n\\'They were many,\\' said Aragorn, \\'and they do not heed the wrath of \\nFangorn, for they come here seldom, and they do not go under the trees. But \\nour paths are likely to lead us into the very forest itself. So have a care! \\n\\nCut no living wood!\\' \\n\\n\\'There is no need,\\' said Gimli. \\'The Riders have left chip and bough \\nenough, and there is dead wood lying in plenty.\\' He went off to gather fuel, \\nand busied himself with building and kindling a fire; but Aragorn sat silent \\nwith his back to the great tree, deep in thought; and Legolas stood alone in \\nthe open, looking towards the profound shadow of the wood, leaning forward, \\nas one who listens to voices calling from a distance. \\n\\nWhen the Dwarf had a small bright blaze going, the three companions \\ndrew close to it and sat together, shrouding the light with their hooded \\nforms. Legolas looked up at the boughs of the tree reaching out above them. \\n\\n\\'Look!\\' he said. \\'The tree is glad of the fire!\\' \\n\\nIt may have been that the dancing shadows tricked their eyes, but \\ncertainly to each of the companions the boughs appeared to be bending this \\nway and that so as to come above the flames, while the upper branches were \\nstooping down; the brown leaves now stood out stiff, and rubbed together \\nlike many cold cracked hands taking comfort in the warmth. \\n\\nThere was a silence, for suddenly the dark and unknown forest, so near \\nat hand, made itself felt as a great brooding presence, full of secret \\npurpose. After a while Legolas spoke again. \\n\\n\\'Celeborn warned us not to go far into Fangorn,\\' he said. \\'Do you know \\nwhy, Aragorn? What are the fables of the forest that Boromir had heard?\\' \\n\\n\\'I have heard many tales in Gondor and elsewhere,\\' said Aragorn, \\'but \\nif it were not for the words of Celeborn I should deem them only fables that \\nMen have made as true knowledge fades. I had thought of asking you what \\nwas \\n\\nthe truth of the matter. And if an Elf of the Wood does not know, how shall \\n\\n\\n\\n\\na Man answer?\\' \\n\\n\\'You have journeyed further than I,\\' said Legolas. \\'I have heard \\nnothing of this in my own land, save only songs that tell how the Onodrim, \\nthat Men call Ents, dwelt there long ago; for Fangorn is old, old even as \\nthe Elves would reckon it.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, it is old,\\' said Aragorn, \\'as old as the forest by the \\nBarrow-downs, and it is far greater. Elrond says that the two are akin, the \\nlast strongholds of the mighty woods of the Elder Days, in which the \\nFirstborn roamed while Men still slept. Yet Fangorn holds some secret of its \\nown. What it is I do not know.\\' \\n\\n\\'And I do not wish to know,\\' said Gimli. \\'Let nothing that dwells in \\nFangorn be troubled on my account!\\' \\n\\nThey now drew lots for the watches, and the lot for the first watch \\nfell to Gimli. The others lay down. Almost at once sleep laid hold on them. \\n\\'Gimli!\\' said Aragorn drowsily. \\'Remember, it is perilous to cut bough or \\ntwig from a living tree in Fangorn. But do not stray far in search of dead \\nwood. Let the fire die rather! Call me at need!\\' \\n\\nWith that he fell asleep. Legolas already lay motionless, his fair \\nhands folded upon his breast, his eyes unclosed, blending living night and \\ndeep dream, as is the way with Elves. Gimli sat hunched by the fire, running \\nhis thumb thoughtfully along the edge of his axe. The tree rustled. There \\nwas no other sound. \\n\\nSuddenly Gimli looked up, and there just on the edge of the fire-light \\nstood an old bent man, leaning on a staff, and wrapped in a great cloak; his \\nwide-brimmed hat was pulled down over his eyes. Gimli sprang up, too \\namazed \\n\\nfor the moment to cry out, though at once the thought flashed into his mind \\nthat Saruman had caught them. Both Aragorn and Legolas, roused by his \\nsudden \\n\\nmovement, sat up and stared. The old man did not speak or make, sign. \\n\\n\\'Well, father, what can we do for you?\\' said Aragorn, leaping to his \\nfeet. \\'Come and be warm, if you are cold!\\' He strode forward, but the old \\nman was gone. There was no trace of him to be found near at hand, and they \\ndid not dare to wander far. The moon had set and the night was very dark. \\n\\nSuddenly Legolas gave a cry. \\'The horses! The horses!\\' \\n\\nThe horses were gone. They had dragged their pickets and disappeared. \\nFor me time the three companions stood still and silent, troubled by this \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnew stroke of ill fortune. They were under the eaves of Fangorn, and endless \\nleagues lay between them and the Men of Rohan, their only friends in this \\nwide and dangerous land. As they stood, it seemed to them that they heard, \\nfar off in the night, the sound of horses whinnying and neighing. Then all \\nwas quiet again, except for the cold rustle of the wind. \\n\\n\\'Well, they are gone,\\' said Aragorn at last. \\'We cannot find them or \\ncatch them; so that if they do not return of their own will, we must do \\nwithout. We started on our feet, and we have those still.\\' \\n\\n\\'Feet!\\' said Gimli. \\'But we cannot eat them as well as walk on them \\' \\n\\nFie threw some fuel on the fire and slumped down beside it. \\n\\n\\'Only a few hours ago you were unwilling to sit on a horse of Rohan,\\' \\nlaughed Legolas. \\'You will make a rider yet.\\' \\n\\n\\'It seems unlikely that I shall have the chance,\\' said Gimli. \\n\\n\\'If you wish to know what I think,\\' he began again after a while \\'I \\nthink it was Saruman. Who else? Remember the words of Jomer: he walks \\nabout \\n\\nlike an old man hooded and cloaked. Those were the words. He has gone off \\nwith our horses, or scared them away, and here we are. There is more trouble \\ncoming to us, mark my words!\\' \\n\\n\\'I mark them,\\' said Aragorn. \\'But I marked also that this old man had a \\nhat not a hood. Still I do not doubt that you guess right, and that we are \\nin peril here, by night or day. Yet in the meantime there is nothing that we \\ncan do but rest, while we may. I will watch for a while now, Gimli. I have \\nmore need of thought than of sleep.\\' \\n\\nThe night passed slowly. Legolas followed Aragorn, and Gimli followed \\nLegolas, and their watches wore away. But nothing happened. The old man did \\nnot appear again, and the horses did not return. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 3 . The Uruk-Hai \\n\\n\\n\\nPippin lay in a dark and troubled dream: it seemed that he could hear \\nhis own small voice echoing in black tunnels, calling Frodo, Frodo ! But \\ninstead of Frodo hundreds of hideous ore-faces grinned at him out of the \\nshadows, hundreds of hideous arms grasped at him from every side. Where \\nwas \\nMerry? \\n\\nHe woke. Cold air blew on his face. He was lying on his back. Evening \\nwas coming and the sky above was growing dim. He turned and found that the \\ndream was little worse than the waking. His wrists, legs, and ankles were \\ntied with cords. Beside him Merry lay, white-faced, with a dirty rag bound \\nacross his brows. All about them sat or stood a great company of Ores. \\n\\nSlowly in Pippin\\'s aching head memory pieced itself together and became \\nseparated from dream-shadows. Of course: he and Merry had run off into the \\nwoods. What had come over them? Why had they dashed off like that, taking \\nno \\n\\nnotice of old Strider? They had run a long way shouting-- he could not \\nremember how far or how long; and then suddenly they had crashed right into \\na group of Ores: they were standing listening, and they did not appear to \\nsee Merry and Pippin until they were almost in their arms. Then they yelled \\nand dozens of other goblins had sprung out of the trees. Merry and he had \\ndrawn their swords, but the Ores did not wish to fight, and had tried only \\nto lay hold of them, even when Merry had cut off several of their arms and \\nhands. Good old Merry! \\n\\nThen Boromir had come leaping through the trees. He had made them \\nfight. He slew many of them and the rest fled. But they had not gone far on \\nthe way back when they were attacked again, by a hundred Ores at least, some \\nof them very large, and they shot a rain of arrows: always at Boromir. \\nBoromir had blown his great horn till the woods rang, and at first the Ores \\nhad been dismayed and had drawn back; but when no answer but the echoes \\ncame, they had attacked more fierce than ever. Pippin did not remember much \\nmore. His last memo was of Boromir leaning against a tree, plucking out an \\narrow; then darkness fell suddenly. \\n\\n\\'I suppose I was knocked on the head,\\' he said to himself. \\'I wonder if \\n\\n\\n\\n\\npoor Merry is much hurt. What has happened to Boromir? Why didn\\'t the \\nOres \\n\\nkill us? Where are we, and where are we going?\\' \\n\\nHe could not answer the questions. He felt cold and sick. \\'I wish \\nGandalf had never persuaded Elrond to let us come,\\' he thought. \\'What good \\nhave I been? Just a nuisance: a passenger, a piece of luggage. And now I \\nhave been stolen and I am just a piece of luggage for the Ores. I hope \\nStrider or someone will come and claim us! But ought I to hope for it? Won\\'t \\nthat throw out all the plans? I wish I could get free!\\' \\n\\nHe struggled a little, quite uselessly. One of the Ores sitting near \\nlaughed and said something to a companion in their abominable tongue. \\'Rest \\nwhile you can, little fool!\\' he said then to Pippin, in the Common Speech, \\nwhich he made almost as hideous as his own language. \\'Rest while you can! \\nWe\\'ll find a use for your legs before long. You\\'ll wish you had got none \\nbefore we get home.\\' \\n\\n\\'If I had my way, you\\'d wish you were dead now,\\' said the other. \\'I\\'d \\nmake you squeak, you miserable rat.\\' He stooped over Pippin bringing his \\nyellow fangs close to his face. He had a black knife with a long jagged \\nblade in his hand. \\'Lie quiet, or I\\'ll tickle you with this,\\' he hissed. \\n\\n\\'Don\\'t draw attention to yourself, or I may forget my orders. Curse the \\nIsengarders! Ugl(r)k u bagronk sha pushdug Saruman-glob b(r)bhosh skai\\' \\nhe \\n\\npassed into a long angry speech in his own tongue that slowly died away into \\nmuttering and snarling. \\n\\nTerrified Pippin lay still, though the pain at his wrists and ankles \\nwas growing, and the stones beneath him were boring into his back. To take \\nhis mind off himself he listened intently to all that he could hear. There \\nwere many voices round about, and though ore-speech sounded at all times \\nfull of hate and anger, it seemed plain that something like a quarrel had \\nbegun, and was getting hotter. \\n\\nTo Pippin\\'s surprise he found that much of the talk was intelligible \\nmany of the Ores were using ordinary language. Apparently the members of \\ntwo \\n\\nor three quite different tribes were present, and they could not understand \\none another\\'s ore-speech. There was an angry debate concerning what they \\nwere to do now: which way they were to take and what should be done with the \\nprisoners. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'There\\'s no time to kill them properly,\\' said one. \\'No time for play on \\nthis trip.\\' \\n\\n\\'That can\\'t be helped,\\' said another. \\'But why not kill them quick, \\nkill them now? They\\'re a cursed nuisance, and we\\'re in a hurry. Evening\\'s \\ncoming on, and we ought to get a move on.\\' \\n\\n\\'Orders.\\' said a third voice in a deep growl. \\'Kill all but NOT the \\nHalfings; they are to be brought back ALIVE as quickly as possible. That\\'s \\nmy orders.\\' \\n\\n\\'What are they wanted for?\\' asked several voices. \\'Why alive? Do they \\ngive good sport?\\' \\n\\n\\'No! I heard that one of them has got something, something that\\'s \\nwanted for the War, some elvish plot or other. Anyway they\\'ll both be \\nquestioned.\\' \\n\\n\\'Is that all you know? Why don\\'t we search them and find out? We might \\nfind something that we could use ourselves.\\' \\n\\n\\'That is a very interesting remark,\\' sneered a voice, softer than the \\nothers but more evil. \\'I may have to report that. The prisoners are NOT to \\nbe searched or plundered: those are my orders.\\' \\n\\n\\'And mine too,\\' said the deep voice. \\'Alive and as captured; no \\nspoiling. That\\'s my orders.\\' \\n\\n\\'Not our orders!\\' said one of the earlier voices. \\'We have come all the \\nway from the Mines to kill, and avenge our folk. I wish to kill, and then go \\nback north.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then you can wish again,\\' said the growling voice. \\'I am Ugl(r)k. I \\ncommand. I return to Isengard by the shortest road.\\' \\n\\n\\'Is Saruman the master or the Great Eye?\\' said the evil voice. \\'We \\nshould go back at once to Lugb(r)rz.\\' \\n\\n\\'If we could cross the Great River, we might,\\' said another voice. \\'But \\nthere are not enough of us to venture down to the bridges.\\' \\n\\n\\'I came across,\\' said the evil voice. \\'A winged Nazgyl awaits us \\nnorthward on the east -bank.\\' \\n\\n\\'Maybe, maybe! Then you\\'ll fly off with our prisoners, and get all the \\npay and praise in Lugb(r)rz, and leave us to foot it as best we can through \\nthe Horse-country. No, we must stick together. These lands are dangerous: \\nfull of foul rebels and brigands.\\' \\n\\n\\'Aye, we must stick together,\\' growled Ugl(r)k. \\'I don\\'t trust you little \\nswine. You\\'ve no guts outside your own sties. But for us you\\'d all have run \\n\\n\\n\\n\\naway. We are the fighting Uruk-hai! We slew the great warrior. We took the \\nprisoners. We are the servants of Saruman the Wise, the White Hand: the Hand \\nthat gives us man\\'s-flesh to eat. We came out of Isengard, and led you here, \\nand we shall lead you back by the way we choose. I am UgKDk. I have spoken.\\' \\n\\n\\'You have spoken more than enough, UgKDk,\\' sneered the evil voice. \\'I \\nwonder how they would like it in Lugb(Drz. They might think that Ugl(r)k\\'s \\nshoulders needed relieving of a swollen head. They might ask where his \\nstrange ideas came from. Did they come from Saruman, perhaps? Who does \\nhe \\n\\nthink he is, setting up on his own with his filthy white badges? They might \\nagree with me, with Grishnbkh their trusted messenger; and I Grishnbkh say \\nthis: Saruman is a fool, and a dirty treacherous fool. But the Great Eye is \\non him. \\n\\n\\'Swine is it? How do you folk like being called swine by the \\nmuck-rakers of a dirty little wizard? It\\'s ore-flesh they eat, I\\'ll \\nwarrant.\\' \\n\\nMany loud yells in ore-speech answered him, and the ringing clash of \\nweapons being drawn. Cautiously Pippin rolled over, hoping to see what would \\nhappen. His guards had gone to join in the fray. In the twilight he saw a \\nlarge black Ore, probably Ugl(r)k, standing facing Grishnbkh, a short \\ncrook -legged creature, very broad and with long arms that hung almost to the \\nground. Round them were many smaller goblins. Pippin supposed that these \\nwere the ones from the North. They had drawn their knives and swords, but \\nhesitated to attack Ugl(r)k. \\n\\nUgl(r)k shouted, and a number of other Ores of nearly his own size ran \\nup. Then suddenly, without warning, Ugl(r)k sprang forwards, and with two \\nswift strokes swept the heads off two of his opponents. Grishnbkh stepped \\naside and vanished into the shadows. The others gave way, and one stepped \\nbackwards and fell over Merry\\'s prostrate form with a curse. Yet that \\nprobably saved his life, for Ugl(r)k\\'s followers leaped over him and cut down \\nanother with their broad-bladed swords. It was the yellow-fanged guard. His \\nbody fell right on top of Pippin, still clutching its long saw-edged knife. \\n\\n\\'Put up your weapons!\\' shouted Ugl(r)k. \\'And let\\'s have no more nonsense! \\nWe go straight west from here, and down the stair. From there straight to \\nthe downs, then along the river to the forest. And we march day and night. \\nThat clear?\\' \\n\\n\\'Now,\\' thought Pippin, \\'if only it takes that ugly fellow a little \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhile to get his troop under control, I\\'ve got a chance.\\' A gleam of hope \\nhad come to him. The edge of the black knife had snicked his arm, and then \\nslid down to his wrist. He felt the blood trickling on to his hand, but he \\nalso felt the cold touch of steel against his skin. \\n\\nThe Ores were getting ready to march again, but some of the Northerners \\nwere still unwilling, and the Isengarders slew two more before the rest were \\ncowed. There was much cursing and confusion. For the moment Pippin was \\nunwatched. His legs were securely bound, but his arms were only tied about \\nthe wrists, and his hands were in front of him. He could move them both \\ntogether, though the bonds were cruelly tight. He pushed the dead Ore to one \\nside, then hardly daring to breathe, he drew the knot of the wrist-cord up \\nand down against the blade of the knife. It was sharp and the dead hand held \\nit fast. The cord was cut! Quickly Pippin took it in his fingers and knotted \\nit again into a loose bracelet of two loops and slipped it over his hands. \\n\\nThen he lay very still. \\n\\n\\'Pick up those prisoners!\\' shouted Ugl(r)k. \\'Don\\'t play any tricks with \\nthem! If they are not alive when we get back, someone else will die too.\\' \\n\\nAn Ore seized Pippin like a sack, put its head between his tied hands, \\ngrabbed his arms and dragged them down, until Pippin\\'s face was crushed \\nagainst its neck; then it jolted off with him. Another treated Merry in the \\nsame way. The Ore\\'s clawlike hand gripped Pippin\\'s arms like iron; the nails \\nbit into him. He shut his eyes and slipped back into evil dreams. \\n\\nSuddenly he was thrown on to the stony floor again. It was early night, \\nbut the slim moon was already falling westward. They were on the edge of a \\ncliff that seemed to look out over a sea of pale mist. There was a sound of \\nwater falling nearby. \\n\\n\\'The scouts have come back at last,\\' said an Ore close at hand. \\n\\n\\'Well, what did you discover?\\' growled the voice of Ugl(r)k. \\n\\n\\'Only a single horseman, and he made off westwards. All\\'s clear now.\\' \\n\\n\\'Now, I daresay. But how long? You fools! You should have shot him. \\nHe\\'ll raise the alarm. The cursed horsebreeders will hear of us by morning. \\nNow we\\'ll have to leg it double quick.\\' \\n\\nA shadow bent over Pippin. It was Ugl(r)k. \\'Sit up!\\' said the Ore. \\'My \\nlads are tired of lugging you about. We have got to climb down and you must \\nuse your legs. Be helpful now. No crying out, no trying to escape. We have \\nways of paying for tricks that you won\\'t like, though they won\\'t spoil your \\nusefulness for the Master.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe cut the thongs round Pippin\\'s legs and ankles, picked him up by his \\nhair and stood him on his feet. Pippin fell down, and UgKDk dragged him up \\nby his hair again. Several Ores laughed. UgKDk thrust a flask between his \\nteeth and poured some burning liquid down his throat: he felt a hot fierce \\nglow flow through him. The pain in his legs and ankles vanished. He could \\nstand. \\n\\n\\'Now for the other!\\' said UgKDk. Pippin saw him go to Merry, who was \\nlying close by, and kick him. Merry groaned. Seizing him roughly UgKDk \\npulled him into a sitting position, and tore the bandage off his head. Then \\nhe smeared the wound with some dark stuff out of a small wooden box. Merry \\ncried out and struggled wildly. \\n\\nThe Ores clapped and hooted. \\'Can\\'t take his medicine,\\' they jeered. \\n\\'Doesn\\'t know what\\'s good for him. Ai! We shall have some fun later.\\' \\n\\nBut at the moment UgKDk was not engaged in sport. He needed speed and \\nhad to humour unwilling followers. He was healing Merry in ore-fashion; and \\nhis treatment worked swiftly. When he had forced a drink from his flask down \\nthe hobbit\\'s throat, cut his leg-bonds, and dragged him to his feet, Merry \\nstood up, looking pale but grim and defiant, and very much alive. The gash \\nin his forehead gave him no more trouble, but he bore a brown scar to the \\nend of his days. \\n\\n\\'Hullo, Pippin!\\' he said. \\'So you\\'ve come on this little expedition, \\ntoo? Where do we get bed and breakfast?\\' \\n\\n\\'Now then!\\' said UgKDk. \\'None of that! Hold your tongues. No talk to \\none another. Any trouble will be reported at the other end, and He\\'ll know \\nhow to pay you. You\\'ll get bed and breakfast all right: more than you can \\nstomach.\\' \\n\\nThe ore -band began to descend a narrow ravine leading down into the \\nmisty plain below. Merry and Pippin, separated by a dozen Ores or more, \\nclimbed down with them. At the bottom they stepped on to grass, and the \\nhearts of the hobbits rose. \\n\\n\\'Now straight on!\\' shouted UgKDk. \\'West and a little north. Follow \\nLugdush.\\' \\n\\n\\'But what are we going to do at sunrise?\\' said some of the Northerners. \\n\\n\\'Go on running,\\' said UgKDk. \\'What do you think? Sit on the grass and \\nwait for the Whiteskins to join the picnic?\\' \\n\\n\\'But we can\\'t run in the sunlight.\\' \\n\\n\\'You\\'ll run with me behind you,\\' said UgKDk. \\'Run! Or you\\'ll never see \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyour beloved holes again. By the White Hand! What\\'s the use of sending out \\nmountain-maggots on a trip, only half trained. Run, curse you! Run while \\nnight lasts!\\' \\n\\nThen the whole company began to run with the long loping strides of \\nOres. They kept no order, thrusting, jostling, and cursing; yet their speed \\nwas very great. Each hobbit had a guard of three. Pippin was far back in the \\nline. He wondered how long he would be able to go on at this pace: he had \\nhad no food since the morning. One of his guards had a whip. But at present \\nthe ore-liquor was still hot in him. His wits, too, were wide-awake. \\n\\nEvery now and again there came into his mind unbidden a vision of the \\nkeen face of Strider bending over a dark trail, and running, running behind. \\n\\nBut what could even a Ranger see except a confused trail of ore-feet? His \\nown little prints and Merry\\'s were overwhelmed by the trampling of the \\niron-shod shoes before them and behind them and about them. \\n\\nThey had gone only a mile or so from the cliff when the land sloped \\ndown into a wide shallow depression, where the ground was soft and wet. Mist \\nlay there, pale-glimmering in the last rays of the sickle moon. The dark \\nshapes of the Ores in front grew dim, and then were swallowed up. \\n\\n\\'Ai! Steady now!\\' shouted UgKDk from the rear. \\n\\nA sudden thought leaped into Pippin\\'s mind, and he acted on it at once. \\n\\nHe swerved aside to the right, and dived out of the reach of his clutching \\nguard, headfirst into the mist; he landed sprawling on the grass. \\n\\n\\'Halt!\\' yelled UgKDk. \\n\\nThere was for a moment turmoil and confusion. Pippin sprang up and ran. \\nBut the Ores were after him. Some suddenly loomed up right in front of him. \\n\\n\\'No hope of escape!\\' thought Pippin. \\'But there is a hope that I have \\nleft some of my own marks unspoilt on the wet ground.\\' He groped with his \\ntwo tied hands at his throat, and unclasped the brooch of his cloak. Just as \\nlong arms and hard claws seized him. he let it fall. \\'There I suppose it \\nwill lie until the end of time,\\' he thought. \\'I don\\'t know why I did it. If \\nthe others have escaped, they\\'ve probably all gone with Frodo.\\' \\n\\nA whip-thong curled round his legs, and he stifled a cry. \\n\\n\\'Enough!\\' shouted UgKDk running up. \\'He\\'s still got to run a long way \\nyet. Make \\'em both run! Just use the whip as a reminder.\\' \\n\\n\\'But that\\'s not all,\\' he snarled, turning to Pippin. \\'I shan\\'t forget. \\n\\nPayment is only put off. Leg it!\\' \\n\\nNeither Pippin nor Merry remembered much of the later part of the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\njourney. Evil dreams and evil waking were blended into a long tunnel of \\nmisery, with hope growing ever fainter behind. They ran, and they ran, \\nstriving to keep up the pace set by the Ores, licked every now and again \\nwith a cruel thong cunningly handled. If they halted or stumbled, they were \\nseized and dragged for some distance. \\n\\nThe warmth of the ore-draught had gone. Pippin felt cold and sick \\nagain. Suddenly he fell face downward on the turf. Hard hands with rending \\nnails gripped and lifted him. He was carried like a sack once more, and \\ndarkness grew about him: whether the darkness of another night, or a \\nblindness of his eyes, he could not tell. \\n\\nDimly he became aware of voices clamouring: it seemed that many of the \\nOres were demanding a halt. UgKDk was shouting. He felt himself flung to the \\nground, and he lay as he fell, till black dreams took him. But he did not \\nlong escape from pain; soon the iron grip of merciless hands was on him \\nagain. For a long time he was tossed and shaken, and then slowly the \\ndarkness gave way, and he came back to the waking world and found that it \\nwas morning. Orders were shouted and he was thrown roughly on the grass. \\n\\nThere he lay for a while, fighting with despair. His head swam, but \\nfrom the heat in his body he guessed that he had been given another draught. \\nAn Ore stooped over him, and flung him some bread and a strip of raw dried \\nflesh. He ate the stale grey bread hungrily, but not the meat. He was \\nfamished but not yet so famished as to eat flesh flung to him by an Ore, the \\nflesh of he dared not guess what creature. \\n\\nHe sat up and looked about. Merry was not far away. They were by the \\nbanks of a swift narrow river. Ahead mountains loomed: a tall peak was \\ncatching the first rays of the sun. A dark smudge of forest lay on the lower \\nslopes before them. \\n\\nThere was much shouting and debating among the Ores; a quarrel seemed \\non the point of breaking out again between the Northerners and the \\nIsengarders. Some were pointing back away south, and some were pointing \\neastward. \\n\\n\\'Very well,\\' said UgKDk. \\'Leave them to me then! No killing, as I\\'ve \\ntold you before; but if you want to throw away what we\\'ve come all the way \\nto get, throw it away ! I\\'ll look after it. Let the fighting Uruk-hai do the \\nwork, as usual. If you\\'re afraid of the Whiteskins, run! Run! There\\'s the \\nforest,\\' he shouted, pointing ahead. \\'Get to it! It\\'s your best hope. Off \\nyou go ! And quick, before I knock a few more heads off, to put some sense \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ninto the others.\\' \\n\\nThere was some cursing and scuffling, and then most of the Northerners \\nbroke away and dashed off, over a hundred of them, running wildly along the \\nriver towards the mountains. The hobbits were left with the Isengarders: a \\ngrim dark band, four score at least of large, swart, slant-eyed Ores with \\ngreat bows and short broad-bladed swords. A few of the larger and bolder \\nNortherners remained with them. \\n\\n\\'Now we\\'ll deal with Grishnbkh,\\' said Ugl(r)k; but some even of his own \\nfollowers were looking uneasily southwards. \\n\\n\\'I know,\\' growled Ugl(r)k. \\'The cursed horse-boys have got wind of us. \\n\\nBut that\\' s all your fault, Snaga. You and the other scouts ought to have \\nyour ears cut off. But we are the fighters. We\\'ll feast on horseflesh yet, \\nor something better.\\' \\n\\nAt that moment Pippin saw why some of the troop had been pointing \\neastward. From that direction there now came hoarse cries, and there was \\nGrishnbkh again, and at his back a couple of score of others like him: \\nlong-armed crook-legged Ores. They had a red eye painted on their shields. \\nUgl(r)k stepped forward to meet them. \\'So you\\'ve come back?\\' he said. \\'Thought \\nbetter of it, eh?\\' \\n\\n\\'I\\'ve returned to see that Orders are carried out and the prisoners \\nsafe,\\' answered Grishnbkh. \\n\\n\\'Indeed!\\' said Ugl(r)k. \\'Waste of effort. Ill see that orders are \\ncarried out in my command. And what else did you come back for? You went \\nin \\n\\na hurry. Did you leave anything behind?\\' \\n\\n\\'I left a fool,\\' snarled Grishnbkh. \\'But there were some stout fellows \\nwith him that are too good to lose. I knew you\\'d lead them into a mess. I\\'ve \\ncome to help them.\\' \\n\\n\\'Splendid!\\' laughed Ugl(r)k. \\'But unless you\\'ve got some guts for \\nfighting, you\\'ve taken the wrong way. Lugb(r)rz was your road. The \\nWhiteskins \\n\\nare coming. What\\'s happened to your precious Nazgyl? Has he had another \\nmount shot under him? Now, if you\\'d brought him along, that might have been \\nuseful-if these Nazgyl are all they make out.\\' \\n\\n\\'Nazgyl, Nazgyl,\\' said Grishnbkh, shivering and licking his lips, as if \\nthe word had a foul taste that he savoured painfully. \\'You speak of what is \\ndeep beyond the reach of your muddy dreams, Ugl(r)k,\\' he said. \\'Nazgyl! Ah! \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll that they make out! One day you\\'ll wish that you had not said that. \\nApe!\\' he snarled fiercely. \\'You ought to know that they\\'re the apple of the \\nGreat Eye. But the winged Nazgyl: not yet, not yet. He won\\'t let them show \\nthemselves across the Great River yet, not too soon. They\\'re for the War -and \\nother purposes.\\' \\n\\n\\'You seem to know a lot,\\' said Ugl(r)k. \\'More than is good for you, I \\nguess. Perhaps those in Lugb(r)rz might wonder how, and why. But in the \\nmeantime the Uruk-hai of Isengard can do the dirty work, as usual. Don\\'t \\nstand slavering there! Get your rabble together! The other swine are legging \\nit to the forest. You\\'d better follow. You wouldn\\'t get back to the Great \\nRiver alive. Right off the mark! Now! I\\'ll be on your heels.\\' \\n\\nThe Isengarders seized Merry and Pippin again and slung them on their \\nbacks. Then the troop started off. Hour after hour they ran, pausing now and \\nagain only to sling the hobbits to fresh carriers. Either because they were \\nquicker and hardier, or because of some plan of Grishnbkh\\'s, the Isengarders \\ngradually passed through the Ores of Mordor, and Grishnbkh\\'s folk closed in \\nbehind. Soon they were gaining also on the Northerners ahead. The forest \\nbegan to draw nearer. \\n\\nPippin was bruised and torn, his aching head was grated by the filthy \\njowl and hairy ear of the Ore that held him. Immediately in front were bowed \\nbacks, and tough thick legs going up and down, up and down, unresting, as if \\nthey were made of wire and horn, beating out the nightmare seconds of an \\nendless time. \\n\\nIn the afternoon Ugl(r)k\\'s troop overtook the Northerners. They were \\nflagging in the rays of the bright sun, winter sun shining in a pale cool \\nsky though it was; their heads were down and their tongues lolling out. \\n\\n\\'Maggots!\\' jeered the Isengarders. \\'You\\'re cooked. The Whiteskins will \\ncatch you and eat you. They\\'re coming!\\' \\n\\nA cry from Grishnbkh showed that this was not mere jest. Horsemen, \\nriding very swiftly, had indeed been sighted: still far behind, but gaining \\non the Ores, gaining on them like a tide over the flats on folk straying in \\na quicksand. \\n\\nThe Isengarders began to run with a redoubled pace that astonished \\nPippin, a terrific spurt it seemed for the end of a race. Then he saw that \\nthe sun was sinking, falling behind the Misty Mountains; shadows reached \\nover the land. The soldiers of Mordor lifted their heads and also began to \\nput on speed. The forest was dark and close. Already they had passed a few \\n\\n\\n\\n\\noutlying trees. The land was beginning to slope upwards, ever more steeply; \\nbut the Ores did not halt. Both Ugl(r)k and Grishnbkh shouted, spurring them \\non to a last effort. \\n\\n\\'They will make it yet. They will escape,\\' thought Pippin. And then he \\nmanaged to twist his neck, so as to glance back with one eye over his \\nshoulder. He saw that riders away eastward were already level with the Ores, \\ngalloping over the plain. The sunset gilded their spears and helmets, and \\nglinted in their pale flowing hair. They were hemming the Ores in, \\npreventing them from scattering, and driving them along the line of the \\nriver. \\n\\nHe wondered very much what kind of folk they were. He wished now that \\nhe had learned more in Rivendell, and looked more at maps and things; but in \\nthose days the plans for the journey seemed to be in more competent hands, \\nand he had never reckoned with being cut off from Gandalf, or from Strider, \\nand even from Frodo. All that he could remember about Rohan was that \\nGandalf s horse, Shadowfax, had come from that land. That sounded hopeful, \\nas far as it went. \\n\\n\\'But how will they know that we are not Ores?\\' he thought. \\'I don\\'t \\nsuppose they\\'ve ever heard of hobbits down here. I suppose I ought to be \\nglad that the beastly Ores look like being destroyed, but I would rather be \\nsaved myself.\\' The chances were that he and Merry would be killed together \\nwith their captors, before ever the Men of Rohan were aware of them. \\n\\nA few of the riders appeared to be bowmen, skilled at shooting from a \\nrunning horse. Riding swiftly into range they shot arrows at the Ores that \\nstraggled behind, and several of them fell; then the riders wheeled away out \\nof the range of the answering bows of their enemies, who shot wildly, not \\ndaring to halt. This happened many times, and on one occasion arrows fell \\namong the Isengarders. One of them, just in front of Pippin, stumbled and \\ndid not get up again. \\n\\nNight came down without the Riders closing in for battle. Many Ores had \\nfallen, but fully two hundred remained. In the early darkness the Ores came \\nto a hillock. The eaves of the forest were very near, probably no more than \\nthree furlongs away, but they could go no further. The horsemen had \\nencircled them. A small band disobeyed UgKDk\\'s command, and ran on \\ntowards \\n\\nthe forest: only three returned. \\n\\n\\'Well, here we are,\\' sneered Grishnbkh. \\'Fine leadership! I hope the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngreat Ugl(r)k will lead us out again.\\' \\n\\n\\'Put those Halflings down!\\' ordered Ugl(r)k, taking no notice of \\nGrishnbkh. \\'You, Lugdush, get two others and stand guard over them! They\\'re \\nnot to be killed, unless the filthy Whiteskins break through. Understand? As \\nlong as I\\'m alive, I want \\'em. But they\\'re not to cry out, and they\\'re not \\nto be rescued. Bind their legs!\\' \\n\\nThe last part of the order was carried out mercilessly. But Pippin \\nfound that for the first time he was close to Merry. The Ores were making a \\ngreat deal of noise, shouting and clashing their weapons, and the hobbits \\nmanaged to whisper together for a while. \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t think much of this,\\' said Merry. \\'I feel nearly done in. Don\\'t \\nthink I could crawl away far, even if I was free.\\' \\n\\n\\'Lembas!\\' whispered Pippin. \\'Lembas: I\\'ve got some. Have you? I don\\'t \\nthink they\\'ve taken anything but our swords.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, I had a packet in my pocket,\\' answered Merry, \\'but it must be \\nbattered to crumbs. Anyway I can\\'t put my mouth in my pocket!\\' \\n\\n\\'You won\\'t have to. I\\'ve--\\'; but just then a savage kick warned Pippin \\nthat the noise had died down, and the guards were watchful. \\n\\nThe night was cold and still. All round the knoll on which the Ores \\nwere gathered little watch-fires sprang up, golden-red in the darkness, a \\ncomplete ring of them. They were within a long bowshot, but the riders did \\nnot show themselves against the light, and the Ores wasted many arrows \\nshooting at the fires, until Ugl(r)k stopped them. The riders made no sound. \\nLater in the night when the moon came out of the mist, then occasionally \\nthey could be seen, shadowy shapes that glinted now and again in the white \\nlight, as they moved in ceaseless patrol. \\n\\n\\'They\\'ll wait for the Sun, curse them!\\' growled one of the guards. \\'Why \\ndon\\'t we get together and charge through? What\\'s old Ugl(r)k think he\\'s doing, \\n\\nI should like to know?\\' \\n\\n\\'I daresay you would,\\' snarled Ugl(r)k stepping up from behind. Meaning \\nI don\\'t think at all, eh? Curse you! You\\'re as bad as the other rabble: the \\nmaggots and the apes of Lugb(r)rz. No good trying to charge with them. They\\'d \\njust squeal and bolt, and there are more than enough of these filthy \\nhorse-boys to mop up our lot on the flat. \\n\\n\\'There\\'s only one thing those maggots can do: they can see like gimlets \\nin the dark. But these Whiteskins have better night-eyes than most Men, from \\nall I\\'ve heard; and don\\'t forget their horses! They can see the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnight-breeze, or so it\\'s said. Still there\\'s one thing the fine fellows \\ndon\\'t know: Mauh(r)r and his lads are in the forest, and they should turn up \\nany time now.\\' \\n\\nUgl(r)k\\'s words were enough, apparently, to satisfy the Isengarders; but \\nthe other Ores were both dispirited and rebellious. They posted a few \\nwatchers, but most of them lay on the ground, resting in the pleasant \\ndarkness. It did indeed become very dark again; for the moon passed westward \\ninto thick cloud, and Pippin could not see anything a few feet away. The \\nfires brought no light to the hillock. The riders were not, however, content \\nmerely to wait for the dawn and let their enemies rest. A sudden outcry on \\nthe east side of the knoll showed that something was wrong. It seemed that \\nsome of the Men had ridden in close, slipped off their horses, crawled to \\nthe edge of the camp and killed several Ores, and then had faded away again. \\nUgl(r)k dashed off to stop a stampede. \\n\\nPippin and Merry sat up. Their guards, Isengarders, had gone with \\nUgl(r)k. But if the hobbits had any thought of escape, it was soon dashed. A \\nlong hairy arm took each of them by the neck and drew them close together. \\nDimly they were aware of Grishnbkh\\'s great head and hideous face between \\nthem; his foul breath was on their cheeks. He began to paw them and feel \\nthem. Pippin shuddered as hard cold fingers groped down his back. \\n\\n\\'Well, my little ones!\\' said Grishnbkh in a soft whisper. \\'Enjoying \\nyour nice rest? Or not? A little awkwardly placed, perhaps: swords and whips \\non one side, and nasty spears on the other! Little people should not meddle \\n_in affairs that are too big for them.\\' His fingers continued to grope. \\n\\nThere was a light like a pale but hot fire behind his eyes. \\n\\nThe thought came suddenly into Pippin\\'s mind, as if caught direct from \\nthe urgent thought of his enemy: \\'Grishnbkh knows about the Ring! He\\'s \\nlooking for it, while Ugl(r)k is busy: he probably wants it for himself.\\' Cold \\nfear was in Pippin\\'s heart, yet at the same time he was wondering what use \\nhe could make of Grishnbkh\\'s desire. \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t think you will find it that way,\\' he whispered. \\'It isn\\'t easy \\nto find.\\' \\n\\n\\' Find it?\\' said Grishnbkh: his fingers stopped crawling and gripped \\nPippin\\'s shoulder. \\'Find what? What are you talking about, little one?\\'. For \\na moment Pippin was silent. Then suddenly in the darkness he made a noise in \\nhis throat: gollum, go llum. \\'Nothing, my precious,\\' he added. \\n\\nThe hobbits felt Grishnbkh\\'s fingers twitch. \\'O ho!\\' hissed the goblin \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsoftly. \\'That\\'s what he means, is it? O ho! Very ve-ry dangerous, my little \\nones.\\' \\n\\n\\'Perhaps,\\' said Merry, now alert and aware of Pippin\\'s guess. \\'Perhaps; \\nand not only for us. Still you know your own business best. Do you want it, \\nor not? And what would you give for it?\\' \\n\\n\\'Do I want it? Do I want it?\\' said Grishnbkh, as if puzzled; but his \\narms were trembling. \\'What would I give for it? What do you mean?\\' \\n\\n\\'We mean,\\' said Pippin, choosing his words carefully, \\'that it\\'s no \\ngood groping in the dark. We could save you time and trouble. But you must \\nuntie our legs first, or we\\'ll do nothing, and say nothing.\\' \\n\\n\\'My dear tender little fools,\\' hissed Grishnbkh, \\'everything you have, \\nand everything you know, will be got out of you in due time: everything! \\nYou\\'ll wish there was more that you could tell to satisfy the Questioner, \\nindeed you will: quite soon. We shan\\'t hurry the enquiry. Oh dear no! What \\ndo you think you\\'ve been kept alive for? My dear little fellows, please \\nbelieve me when I say that it was not out of kindness: that\\'s not even one \\nof UgKDk\\'s faults.\\' \\n\\n\\'I find it quite easy to believe,\\' said Merry. \\'But you haven\\'t got \\nyour prey home yet. And it doesn\\'t seem to be going your way, whatever \\nhappens. If we come to Isengard, it won\\'t be the great Grishnbkh that \\nbenefits: Saruman will take all that he can find. If you want anything for \\nyourself, now\\'s the time to do a deal.\\' \\n\\nGrishnbkh began to lose his temper. The name of Saruman seemed \\nspecially to enrage him. Time was passing and the disturbance was dying \\ndown. Ugl(r)k or the Isengarders might return at any minute. \\n\\n\\'Have you got it -- either of you?\\' he snarled. \\n\\n\\'Gollum, go llum!\\' said Pippin. \\n\\n\\'Untie our legs!\\' said Merry. \\n\\nThey felt the Ore\\'s arms trembling violently. \\'Curse you, you filthy \\nlittle vermin!\\' he hissed. \\'Untie your legs? I\\'ll untie every string in your \\nbodies. Do you think I can\\'t search you to the bones? Search you! I\\'ll cut \\nyou both to quivering shreds. I don\\'t need the help of your legs to get you \\naway-and have you all to myself!\\' \\n\\nSuddenly he seized them. The strength in his long arms and shoulders \\nwas terrifying. He tucked them one under each armpit, and crushed them \\nfiercely to his sides; a great stifling hand was clapped over each of their \\nmouths. Then he sprang forward, stooping low. Quickly and silently he went, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nuntil he came to the edge of the knoll. There, choosing a gap between the \\nwatchers, he passed like an evil shadow out into the night, down the slope \\nand away westward towards the river that flowed out of the forest. In that \\ndirection there was a wide open space with only one fire. \\n\\nAfter going a dozen yards he halted, peering and listening. Nothing \\ncould be seen or heard. He crept slowly on, bent almost double. Then he \\nsquatted and listened again. Then he stood up, as if to risk a sudden dash. \\n\\nAt that very moment the dark form of a rider loomed up right in front of \\nhim. A horse snorted and reared. A man called out. \\n\\nGrishnbkh flung himself on the ground flat, dragging the hobbits under \\nhim; then he drew his sword. No doubt he meant to kill his captives, rather \\nthan allow them to escape or to be rescued; but it was his undoing. The \\nsword rang faintly, and glinted a little in the light of the fire away to \\nhis left. An arrow came whistling out of the gloom: it was aimed with skill, \\nor guided by fate, and it pierced his right hand. He dropped the sword and \\nshrieked. There was a quick beat of hoofs, and even as Grishnbkh leaped up \\nand ran, he was ridden down and a spear passed through him. He gave a \\nhideous shivering cry and lay still. \\n\\nThe hobbits remained flat on the ground, as Grishnbkh had left them. \\nAnother horseman came riding swiftly to his comrade\\'s aid. Whether because \\nof some special keenness of sight, or because of some other sense, the horse \\nlifted and sprang lightly over them; but its rider did not see them, lying \\ncovered in their elven-cloaks, too crushed for the moment, and too afraid to \\nmove. \\n\\nAt last Merry stirred and whispered softly: \\'So far so good: but how \\nare we to avoid being spitted?\\' \\n\\nThe answer came almost immediately. The cries of Grishnbkh had roused \\nthe Ores. From the yells and screeches that came from the knoll the hobbits \\nguessed that their disappearance had been discovered: Ugl(r)k was probably \\nknocking off a few more heads. Then suddenly the answering cries of \\nore-voices came from the right, outside the circle of watch-fires, from the \\ndirection of the forest and the mountains. Mauh(r)r had apparently arrived and \\nwas attacking the besiegers. There was the sound of galloping horses. The \\nRiders were drawing in their ring close round the knoll, risking the \\nore-arrows, so as to prevent any sortie, while a company rode off to deal \\nwith the newcomers. Suddenly Merry and Pippin realized that without moving \\nthey were now outside the circle: there was nothing between them and escape. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Now,\\' said Merry, \\'if only we had our legs and hands free, we might \\nget away. But I can\\'t touch the knots, and I can\\'t bite them.\\' \\n\\n\\'No need to try,\\' said Pippin. \\'I was going to tell you: I\\'ve managed \\nto free my hands. These loops are only left for show. You\\'d better have a \\nbit of lembas first.\\' \\n\\nHe slipped the cords off his wrists, and fished out a packet. The cakes \\nwere broken, but good, still in their leaf- wrappings. The hobbits each ate \\ntwo or three pieces. The taste brought back to them the memory of fair \\nfaces, and laughter, and wholesome food in quiet days now far away. For a \\nwhile they ate thoughtfully, sitting in the dark, heedless of the cries and \\nsounds of battle nearby. Pippin was the first to come back to the present. \\n\\n\\'We must be off,\\' he said. \\'Half a moment!\\' Grishnbkh\\'s sword was lying \\nclose at hand, but it was too heavy and clumsy for him to use; so he crawled \\nforward, and finding the body of the goblin he drew from its sheath a long \\nsharp knife. With this he quickly cut their bonds. \\n\\n\\'Now for it!\\' he said. \\'When we\\'ve warmed up a bit, perhaps we shall be \\nable to stand again, and walk. But in any case we had better start by \\ncrawling.\\' \\n\\nThey crawled. The turf was deep and yielding, and that helped them: but \\nit seemed a long slow business. They gave the watch-fire a wide berth, and \\nwormed their way forward bit by bit, until they came to the edge of the \\nriver, gurgling away in the black shadows under its deep banks. Then they \\nlooked back. \\n\\nThe sounds had died away. Evidently Mauh(r)r and his \\'lads\\' had been \\nkilled or driven off. The Riders had returned to their silent ominous vigil. \\n\\nIt would not last very much longer. Already the night was old. In the East, \\nwhich had remained unclouded, the sky was beginning to grow pale. \\n\\n\\'We must get under cover,\\' said Pippin, \\'or we shall be seen. It will \\nnot be any comfort to us, if these riders discover that we are not Ores \\nafter we are dead.\\' He got up and stamped his feet. \\'Those cords have cut me \\nlike wires; but my feet are getting warm again. I could stagger on now. What \\nabout you, Merry?\\' \\n\\nMerry got up. \\'Yes,\\' he said, \\'I can manage it. Lembas does put heart \\ninto you! A more wholesome sort of feeling, too, than the heat of that \\nore-draught. I wonder what it was made of. Better not to know, I expect. \\nLet\\'s get a drink of water to wash away the thought of it!\\' \\n\\n\\'Not here, the banks are too steep,\\' said Pippin. \\'Forward now!\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThey turned and walked side by side slowly along the line of the river. \\nBehind them the light grew in the East. As they walked they compared notes, \\ntalking lightly in hobbit-fashion of the things that had happened since \\ntheir capture. No listener would have guessed from their words that they had \\nsuffered cruelly, and been in dire peril, going without hope towards torment \\nand death; or that even now, as they knew well, they had little chance of \\never finding friend or safety again. \\n\\n\\'You seem to have been doing well, Master Took,\\' said Merry. \\'You will \\nget almost a chapter in old Bilbo\\'s book, if ever I get a chance to report \\nto him. Good work: especially guessing that hairy villain\\'s little game, and \\nplaying up to him. But I wonder if anyone will ever pick up your trail and \\nfind that brooch. I should hate to lose mine, but I am afraid yours is gone \\nfor good. \\n\\n\\'I shall have to brush up my toes, if I am to get level with you. \\n\\nIndeed Cousin Brandybuck is going in front now. This is where he comes in. I \\ndon\\'t suppose you have much notion where we are; but I spent my time at \\nRivendell rather better. We are walking west along the Entwash. The butt-end \\nof the Misty Mountains is in front, and Fangorn Forest.\\' \\n\\nEven as he spoke the dark edge of the forest loomed up straight before \\nthem. Night seemed to have taken refuge under its great trees, creeping away \\nfrom the coming Dawn. \\n\\n\\'Lead on, Master Brandybuck!\\' said Pippin. \\'Or lead back! We have been \\nwarned against Fangorn. But one so knowing will not have forgotten that.\\' \\n\\n\\'I have not,\\' answered Merry; \\'but the forest seems better to me, all \\nthe same, than turning back into the middle of a battle.\\' \\n\\nHe led the way in under the huge branches of the trees. Old beyond \\nguessing, they seemed. Great trailing beards of lichen hung from them, \\nblowing and swaying in the breeze. Out of the shadows the hobbits peeped, \\ngazing back down the slope: little furtive figures that in the dim light \\nlooked like elf-children in the deeps of time peering out of the Wild Wood \\nin wonder at their first Dawn. \\n\\nFar over the Great River, and the Brown Lands, leagues upon grey \\nleagues away, the Dawn came, red as flame. Loud rang the hunting-horns to \\ngreet it. The Riders of Rohan sprang suddenly to life. Horn answered horn \\nagain. \\n\\nMerry and Pippin heard, clear in the cold air, the neighing of \\nwar-horses, and the sudden singing of many men. The Sun\\'s limb was lifted, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nan arc of fire, above the margin of the world. Then with a great cry the \\nRiders charged from the East; the red light gleamed on mail and spear. The \\nOres yelled and shot all the arrows that remained to them. The hobbits saw \\nseveral horsemen fall; but their line held on up the hill and over it, and \\nwheeled round and charged again. Most of the raiders that were left alive \\nthen broke and fled, this way and that, pursued one by one to the death. But \\none band, holding together in a black wedge, drove forward resolutely in the \\ndirection of the forest. Straight up the slope they charged towards the \\nwatchers. Now they were drawing near, and it seemed certain that they would \\nescape: they had already hewn down three Riders that barred their way. \\n\\n\\'We have watched too long,\\' said Merry. \\'There\\'s Ugl(r)k! I don\\'t want to \\nmeet him again.\\' The hobbits turned and fled deep into the shadows of the \\nwood. \\n\\nSo it was that they did not sec the last stand, when Ugl(r)k was \\novertaken and brought to bay at the very edge of Fangorn. There he was slain \\nat last by Jomer, the Third Marshal of the Mark, who dismounted and fought \\nhim sword to sword. And over the wide fields the keen-eyed Riders hunted \\ndown the few Ores that had escaped and still had strength to fly. \\n\\nThen when they had laid their fallen comrades in a mound and had sung \\ntheir praises, the Riders made a great fire and scattered the ashes of their \\nenemies. So ended the raid, and no news of it came ever back either to \\nMordor or to Isengard; but the smoke of the burning rose high to heaven and \\nwas seen by many watchful eyes. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 4 . Treebeard \\n\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile the hobbits went with as much speed as the dark and tangled \\nforest allowed, following the line of the running stream, westward and up \\ntowards the slopes of the mountains, deeper and deeper into Fangorn. Slowly \\ntheir fear of the Ores died away, and their pace slackened. A queer stifling \\nfeeling came over them, as if the air were too thin or too scanty for \\nbreathing. \\n\\nAt last Merry halted. \\'We can\\'t go on like this,\\' he panted. \\'I want \\nsome air.\\' \\n\\n\\'Let\\'s have a drink at any rate,\\' said Pippin. \\'I\\'m parched.\\' He \\nclambered on to a great tree-root that wound down into the stream, and \\nstooping drew up some water in his cupped hands. It was clear and cold, and \\nhe took many draughts. Merry followed him. The water refreshed them and \\nseemed to cheer their hearts; for a while they sat together on the brink of \\nthe stream, dabbling their sore feet and legs, and peering round at the \\ntrees that stood silently about them, rank upon rank, until they faded away \\ninto grey twilight in every direction. \\n\\n\\'I suppose you haven\\'t lost us already?\\' said Pippin, leaning back \\nagainst a great tree-trunk. \\'We can at least follow the course of this \\nstream, the Entwash or whatever you call it, and get out again the way we \\ncame.\\' \\n\\n\\'We could, if our legs would do it,\\' said Merry; \\'and if we could \\nbreathe properly.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, it is all very dim, and stuffy, in here,\\' said Pippin. \\'It \\nreminds me, somehow, of the old room in the Great Place of the Tooks away \\nback in the Smials at Tuckborough: a huge place, where the furniture has \\nnever been moved or changed for generations. They say the Old Took lived in \\nit year after year, while he and the room got older and shabbier \\ntogether-and it has never changed since he died, a century ago. And Old \\nGerontius was my great-great-grandfather: that puts it back a bit. But that \\nis nothing to the old feeling of this wood. Look at all those weeping, \\ntrailing, beards and whiskers of lichen! And most of the trees seem to be \\nhalf covered with ragged dry leaves that have never fallen. Untidy. I can\\'t \\nimagine what spring would look like here, if it ever comes; still less a \\nspring-cleaning.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'But the Sun at any rate must peep in sometimes.\\' said Merry. \\'It does \\nnot look or feel at all like Bilbo\\'s description of Mirkwood. That was all \\ndark and black, and the home of dark black things. This is just dim, and \\nfrightfully tree-ish. You can\\'t imagine animals living here at all, or \\nstaying for long.\\' \\n\\n\\'No, nor hobbits,\\' said Pippin. \\'And I don\\'t like the thought of trying \\nto get through it either. Nothing to cat for a hundred miles, I should \\nguess. How are our supplies?\\' \\n\\n\\'Low,\\' said Merry. \\'We ran off with nothing but a couple of spare \\npackets of lembas, and left everything else behind.\\' They looked at what \\nremained of the elven-cakes: broken fragments for about five meagre days, \\nthat was all. \\'And not a wrap or a blanket,\\' said Merry. \\'We shall be cold \\ntonight, whichever way we go.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, we\\'d better decide on the way now,\\' said Pippin. \\'The morning \\nmust be getting on.\\' \\n\\nJust then they became aware of a yellow light that had appeared, some \\nway further on into the wood: shafts of sunlight seemed suddenly to have \\npierced the forest -roof. \\n\\n\\'Hullo!\\' said Merry. \\'The Sun must have run into a cloud while we\\'ve \\nbeen under these trees, and now she has run out again; or else she has \\nclimbed high enough to look down through some opening. It isn\\'t far let\\'s go \\nand investigate!\\' \\n\\nThey found it was further than they thought. The ground was rising \\nsteeply still, and it was becoming increasingly stony. The light grew \\nbroader as they went on, and soon they saw that there was a rock -wall before \\nthem: the side of a hill, or the abrupt end of some long root thrust out by \\nthe distant mountains. No trees grew on it, and the sun was falling full on \\nits stony face. The twigs of the trees at its foot were stretched out stiff \\nand still, as if reaching out to the warmth. Where all had looked so shabby \\nand grey before, the wood now gleamed with rich browns, and with the \\nsmooth \\n\\nblack-greys of bark like polished leather. The boles of the trees glowed \\nwith a soft green like young grass: early spring or a fleeting vision of it \\nwas about them. \\n\\nIn the face of the stony wall there was something like a stair: natural \\nperhaps, and made by the weathering and splitting of the rock, for it was \\nrough and uneven. High up, almost level with the tops of forest-trees, there \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwas a shelf under a cliff. Nothing grew there but a few grasses and weeds at \\nits edge, and one old stump of a tree with only two bent branches left: it \\nlooked almost like the figure of some gnarled old man, standing there, \\nblinking in the morning -light. \\n\\n\\'Up we go!\\' said Merry joyfully. \\'Now for a breath of air, and a sight \\nof the land!\\' \\n\\nThey climbed and scrambled up the rock. If the stair had been made it \\nwas for bigger feet and longer legs than theirs. They were too eager to be \\nsurprised at the remarkable way in which the cuts and sores of their \\ncaptivity had healed and their vigour had returned. They came at length to \\nthe edge of the shelf almost at the feet of the old stump; then they sprang \\nup and turned round with their backs to the hill, breathing deep, and \\nlooking out eastward. They saw that they had only come some three or four \\nmiles into the forest: the heads of the trees marched down the slopes \\ntowards the plain. There, near the fringe of the forest, tall spires of \\ncurling black smoke went up, wavering and floating towards them. \\n\\n\\'The wind\\'s changing,\\' said Merry. \\'It\\'s turned east again. It feels \\ncool up here.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Pippin; \\'I\\'m afraid this is only a passing gleam, and it \\nwill all go grey again. What a pity! This shaggy old forest looked so \\ndifferent in the sunlight. I almost felt I liked the place.\\' \\n\\n\\'Almost felt you liked the Forest! That\\'s good! That\\'s uncommonly kind \\nof you,\\' said a strange voice. \\'Turn round and let me have a look at your \\nfaces. I almost feel that I dislike you both, but do not let us be hasty. \\n\\nTurn round!\\' A large knob-knuckled hand was laid on each of their shoulders, \\nand they were twisted round, gently but irresistibly; then two great arms \\nlifted them up. \\n\\nThey found that they were looking at a most extraordinary face. It \\nbelonged to a large Man-like, almost Troll-like, figure, at least fourteen \\nfoot high, very sturdy, with a tall head, and hardly any neck. Whether it \\nwas clad in stuff like green and grey bark, or whether that was its hide, \\nwas difficult to say. At any rate the arms, at a short distance from the \\ntrunk, were not wrinkled, but covered with a brown smooth skin. The large \\nfeet had seven toes each. The lower part of the long face was covered with a \\nsweeping grey beard, bushy, almost twiggy at the roots, thin and mossy at \\nthe ends. But at the moment the hobbits noted little but the eyes. These \\ndeep eyes were now surveying them, slow and solemn, but very penetrating. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThey were brown, shot with a green light. Often afterwards Pippin tried to \\ndescribe his first impression of them. \\n\\n\\'One felt as if there was an enormous well behind them, filled up with \\nages of memory and long, slow, steady thinking; but their surface was \\nsparkling with the present: like sun shimmering on the outer leaves of a \\nvast tree, or on the ripples of a very deep lake. I don\\'t know but it felt \\nas if something that grew in the ground-asleep, you might say, or just \\nfeeling itself as something between roof-tip and leaf-tip, between deep \\nearth and sky had suddenly waked up, and was considering you with the same \\nslow care that it had given to its own inside affairs for endless years.\\' \\n\\n\\'Hrum, Hoorn,\\' murmured the voice, a deep voice like a very deep \\nwoodwind instrument. \\'Very odd indeed! Do not be hasty, that is my motto. \\nBut if I had seen you, before I heard your voices-I liked them: nice little \\nvoices: they reminded me of something I cannot remember-- if I had seen you \\nbefore I heard you, I should have just trodden on you, taking you for little \\nOres, and found out my mistake afterwards. Very odd you are, indeed. Root \\nand twig, very odd!\\' \\n\\nPippin, though still amazed, no longer felt afraid. Under those eyes he \\nfelt a curious suspense, but not fear. \\'Please.\\' he said, \\'who are you? And \\nwhat are you?\\' \\n\\nA queer look came into the old eyes, a kind of wariness; the deep wells \\nwere covered over. \\'Hrum, now,\\' answered the voice; \\'well, I am an Ent, or \\nthat\\'s what they call me. Yes, Ent is the word. The Ent, I am, you might \\nsay, in your manner of speaking. Fangorn is my name according to some, \\nTreebeard others make it. Treebeard will do.\\' \\n\\n\\'An EntT said Merry. \\'What\\'s that? But what do you call yourself? \\n\\nWhat\\'s your real name?\\' \\n\\n\\'Hoo now!\\' replied Treebeard. \\'Hoo! Now that would be telling! Not so \\nhasty. And / am doing the asking. You are in my country. What are you, I \\nwonder? I cannot place you. You do not seem to come in the old lists that I \\nlearned when I was young. But that was a long, long time ago, and they may \\nhave made new lists. Let me see! Let me see! Plow did it go? \\n\\nLearn now the lore of Living Creatures! \\n\\nFirst name the four, the free peoples: \\n\\nEldest of all, the elf-children; \\n\\nDwarf the delver, dark are his houses; \\n\\nEnt the earthborn, old as mountains; \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMan the mortal, master of horses: \\n\\nHm, hm, hm. \\n\\nBeaver the builder, buck the leaper, \\n\\nBear bee-hunter, boar the fighter; \\n\\nHound is hungry, hare is fearful... \\n\\nhm, hm. \\n\\nEagle in eyrie, ox in pasture, \\n\\nHart horn-crowned; hawk is swiftest \\n\\nSwan the whitest, serpent coldest... \\n\\nHoorn, hm; hoom. hm. how did it go? Room turn, room turn, roomty toom \\nturn. \\n\\nIt was a long list. But anyway you do not seem to fit in anywhere!\\' \\n\\n\\'We always seem to have got left out of the old lists, and the old \\nstories,\\' said Merry. \\'Yet we\\'ve been about for quite a long time. We\\'re \\nhobbits\\' \\n\\n\\'Why not make a new line?\\' said Pippin. \\n\\n\\'Half-grown hobbits, the hole-dwellers. \\n\\nPut us in amongst the four, next to Man (the Big People) and you\\'ve got \\nit.\\' \\n\\n\\'Hm! Not bad, not bad,\\' said Treebeard. \\'That would do. So you live in \\nholes, eh? It sounds very right and proper. Who calls you hobbits, though? \\nThat does not sound elvish to me. Elves made all the old words: they began \\nit.\\' \\n\\n\\'Nobody else calls us hobbits; we call ourselves that,\\' said Pippin. \\n\\n\\'Hoom, hmm! Come now! Not so hasty! You call yourselves hobbits? But \\nyou should not go telling just anybody. You\\'ll be letting out your own right \\nnames if you\\'re not careful.\\' \\n\\n\\'We aren\\'t careful about that,\\' said Merry. \\'As a matter of fact I\\'m a \\nBrandybuck, Meriadoc Brandybuck, though most people call me just Merry.\\' \\n\\n\\'And I\\'m a Took, Peregrin Took, but I\\'m generally called Pippin, or \\neven Pip.\\' \\n\\n\\'Hm, but you are hasty folk, I see,\\' said Treebeard. \\'I am honoured by \\nyour confidence; but you should not be too free all at once. There are Ents \\nand Ents, you know; or there are Ents and things that look like Ents but \\nain\\'t, as you might say. I\\'ll call you Merry and Pippin if you please-nice \\nnames. For I am not going to tell you my name, not yet at any rate.\\' A queer \\nhalf-knowing, half-humorous look came with a green flicker into his eyes. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'For one thing it would take a long while: my name is growing all the time, \\nand I\\'ve lived a very long, long time; so my name is like a story. Real \\nnames tell you the story of the things they belong to in my language, in the \\nOld Entish as you might say. It is a lovely language, but it takes a very \\nlong time to say anything in it, because we do not say anything in it. \\nunless it is worth taking a long time to say, and to listen to. \\n\\n\\'But now,\\' and the eyes became very bright and \\'present\\', seeming to \\ngrow smaller and almost sharp, \\'what is going on? What are you doing in it \\nall? I can see and hear ( and smell and feel) a great deal from this, from \\nthis, from this a-lalla-lalla-rumba-kamanda-lind-or-bur(r)ml. Excuse me: that \\nis a part of my name for it; I do not know what the word is in the outside \\nlanguages: you know, the thing we are on, where I stand and look out on fine \\nmornings, and think about the Sun, and the grass beyond the wood, and the \\nhorses, and the clouds, and the unfolding of the world. What is going on? \\nWhat is Gandalf up to? And these -- burbrum,\\' he made a deep rumbling noise \\nlike a discord on a great organ -- \\'these Ores, and young Saruman down at \\nIsengard? I like news. But not too quick now.\\' \\n\\n\\'There is quite a lot going on,\\' said Merry: \\'and even if we tried to \\nbe quick, it would take a long time to tell. But you told us not to be \\nhasty. Ought we to tell you anything so soon? Would you think it rude, if we \\nasked what you are going to do with us, and which side you are on? And did \\nyou know Gandalf?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, I do know him: the only wizard that really cares about trees \\' \\nsaid Treebeard. \\'Do you know him?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Pippin sadly, \\'we did. He was a great friend, and he was \\nour guide.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then I can answer your other questions,\\' said Treebeard. \\'I am not \\ngoing to do anything with you: not if you mean by that \\'do something to you\\' \\nwithout your leave. We might do some things together. I don\\'t know about \\nsides. I go my own way; but your way may go along with mine for a while. But \\nyou speak of Master Gandalf, as if he was in a story that had come to an \\nend.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, we do,\\' said Pippin sadly. \\'The story seems to be going on, but I \\nam afraid Gandalf has fallen out of it.\\' \\n\\n\\'Hoo, come now!\\' said Treebeard. \\'Hoorn, hm, ah well.\\' He paused, \\nlooking long at the hobbits: \\'Hoorn, ah, well I do not know what to say. Come \\nnow!\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'If you would like to hear more, said Merry, \\'we will tell you. But it \\nwill take some time. Wouldn\\'t you like to put us down? Couldn\\'t we sit here \\ntogether in the sun, while it lasts? You must be getting tired of holding us \\nup.\\' \\n\\n\\'Hm, tiredl No. I am not tired. I do not easily get tired. And I do not \\nsit down. I am not very, hm, bendable. But there, the Sun is going in. Let \\nus leave this -- did you say what you call it?\\' \\n\\n\\'Hill?\\' suggested Pippin. \\'Shelf? Step?\\' suggested Merry. \\n\\nTreebeard repeated the words thoughtfully. \\'Hill. Yes, that was it. But \\nit is a hasty word for a thing that has stood here ever since this part of \\nthe world was shaped. Never mind. Let us leave it, and go.\\' \\n\\n\\'Where shall we go?\\' asked Merry. \\n\\n\\'To my home, or one of my homes,\\' answered Treebeard. \\n\\n\\'Is it far?\\' \\n\\n\\'I do not know. You might call it far, perhaps. But what does that \\nmatter?\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, you see, we have lost all our belongings,\\' said Merry. \\'We have \\nonly a little food.\\' \\n\\n\\'O! Hm! You need not trouble about that,\\' said Treebeard. \\'I can give \\nyou a drink that will keep you green and growing for a long, long while. And \\nif we decide to part company, I can set you down outside my country at any \\npoint you choose. Let us go!\\' \\n\\nHolding the hobbits gently but firmly, one in the crook of each arm, \\nTreebeard lifted up first one large foot and then the other, and moved them \\nto the edge of the shelf. The rootlike toes grasped the rocks. Then \\ncarefully and solemnly, he stalked down from step to step, and reached the \\nfloor of the Forest. \\n\\nAt once he set off with long deliberate strides through the trees, \\ndeeper and deeper into the wood, never far from the stream, climbing \\nsteadily up towards the slopes of the mountains. Many of the trees seemed \\nasleep, or as unaware of him as of any other creature that merely passed by; \\nbut some quivered, and some raised up their branches above his head as he \\napproached. All the while, as he walked, he talked to himself in a long \\nrunning stream of musical sounds. \\n\\nThe hobbits were silent for some time. They felt, oddly enough, safe \\nand comfortable, and they had a great deal to think and wonder about. At \\nlast Pippin ventured to speak again. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Please, Treebeard,\\' he said, \\'could I ask you something? Why did \\nCeleborn warn us against your forest? He told us not to risk getting \\nentangled in it.\\' \\n\\n\\'Hmm, did he now?\\' rumbled Treebeard. \\'And I might have said much the \\nsame, if you had been going the other way. Do not risk getting entangled in \\nthe woods of Laurelindurenan ! That is what the Elves used to call it, but \\nnow they make the name shorter: Lothlurien they call it. Perhaps they are \\nright: maybe it is fading; not growing. Land of the Valley of Singing Gold, \\nthat was it, once upon a time. Now it is the Dreamflower. Ah well! But it is \\na queer place, and not for just any one to venture in. I am surprised that \\nyou ever got out, but much more surprised that you ever got in: that has not \\nhappened to strangers for many a year. It is a queer land. \\n\\n\\'And so is this. Folk have come to grief here. Aye, they have, to \\ngrief. Laurelindurenan lindelorendor malinornjlion ornemalin ,\\' he hummed to \\nhimself. \\'They are falling rather behind the world in there, I guess,\\' he \\nsaid \\'Neither this country, nor anything else outside the Golden Wood, is \\nwhat it was when Celeborn was young. Still: \\n\\nTaurelilumla-tumbalemorna Tumbaletaurla Lumlanor, 1 \\n\\nthat is what they used to say. Things have changed, but it is still \\ntrue in places.\\' \\n\\n\\'What do you mean?\\' said Pippin. \\'What is true?\\' \\n\\n\\'The trees and the Ents,\\' said Treebeard. \\'I do not understand all that \\ngoes on myself, so I cannot explain it to you. Some of us are still true \\nEnts, and lively enough in our fashion, but many are growing sleepy, going \\ntree-ish, as you might say. Most of the trees are just trees, of course; but \\nmany are half awake. Some are quite wide awake, and a few are, well, ah, \\nwell getting Entish. That is going on all the time. \\n\\n\\'When that happens to a tree, you find that some have bad hearts. \\nNothing to do with their wood: I do not mean that. Why, I knew some good old \\nwillows down the Ent wash, gone long ago, alas! They were quite hollow, \\nindeed they were falling all to pieces, but as quiet and sweet-spoken as a \\nyoung leaf. And then there are some trees in the valleys under the \\nmountains, sound as a bell, and bad right through. That sort of thing seems \\nto spread. There used to be some very dangerous parts in this country. There \\nare still some very black patches.\\' \\n\\n\\'Like the Old Forest away to the north, do you mean?\\' asked Merry. \\n\\n\\'Aye, aye. something like, but much worse. I do not doubt there is some \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nshadow of the Great Darkness lying there still away north; and bad memories \\nare handed down. But there are hollow dales in this land where the Darkness \\nhas never been lifted, and the trees are older than I am. Still, we do what \\nwe can. We keep off strangers and the foolhardy; and we train and we teach, \\nwe walk and we weed. \\n\\n\\'We are tree-herds, we old Ents. Few enough of us are left now. Sheep \\nget like shepherd, and shepherds like sheep, it is said; but slowly, and \\nneither have long in the world. It is quicker and closer with trees and \\nEnts, and they walk down the ages together. For Ents are more like Elves: \\nless interested in themselves than Men are, and better at getting inside \\nother things. And yet again Ents are more like Men, more changeable than \\nElves are, and quicker at taking the colour of the outside, you might say. \\n\\nOr better than both: for they are steadier and keep their minds on things \\nlonger. \\'Some of my kin look just like trees now, and need something great \\nto rouse them; and they speak only in whispers. But some of my trees are \\nlimb-lithe, and many can talk to me. Elves began it, of course, waking trees \\nup and teaching them to speak and learning their tree-talk. They always \\nwished to talk to everything, the old Elves did. But then the Great Darkness \\ncame, and they passed away over the Sea, or fled into far valleys, and hid \\nthemselves, and made songs about days that would never come again. Never \\nagain. Aye, aye, there was all one wood once upon a time: from here to the \\nMountains of Lune, and this was just the East End. \\n\\n\\'Those were the broad days! Time was when I could walk and sing all day \\nand hear no more than the echo of my own voice in the hollow hills. The \\nwoods were like the woods of Lothlurien. only thicker stronger, younger. And \\nthe smell of the air! I used to spend a week just breathing.\\' \\n\\nTreebeard fell silent, striding along, and yet making hardly a sound \\nwith his great feet. Then he began to hum again, and passed into a murmuring \\nchant. Gradually the hobbits became aware that he was chanting to them: \\n\\nIn the willow-meads ofTasarinan I walked in the Spring. \\n\\nAh! the sight and the smell of the Spring in Nan-tasarion! \\n\\nAnd I said that was good. \\n\\nI wandered in Summer in the elm-woods of Ossiriand. \\n\\nAh! the light and the music in the Summer by the Seven Rivers of Ossir! \\n\\nAnd I thought that was best. \\n\\nTo the beeches ofNeldorethlcame in the Autumn. \\n\\nAh! the gold and the red and the sighing of leaves in the Autumn in \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTaur-na-neldor! \\n\\nIt was more than my desire. \\n\\nTo the pine-trees upon the highland of Dorthonion I climbed in the \\nWinter. \\n\\nAh! the wind and the whiteness and the black branches of Winter upon \\nOrod-na-Thfn! \\n\\nMy voice went up and sang in the sky. \\n\\nAnd now all those lands lie under the wave. \\n\\nAnd I walk in Ambaruna, in Tauremorna, in Aldaluml. \\n\\nIn my own land, in the country of F angorn, \\n\\nWhere the roots are long, \\n\\nAnd the years lie thicker than the leaves \\n\\nIn Tauremornaluml. \\n\\nHe ended, and strode on silently, and in all the wood, as far as ear \\ncould reach, there was not a sound. \\n\\nThe day waned, and dusk was twined about the boles of the trees. At \\nlast the hobbits saw, rising dimly before them, a steep dark land: they had \\ncome to the feet of the mountains, and to the green roots of tall Methedras. \\nDown the hillside the young Entwash, leaping from its springs high above, \\nran noisily from step to step to meet them. On the right of the stream there \\nwas a long slope, clad with grass, now grey in the twilight. No trees grew \\nthere and it was open to the sky; stars were shining already in lakes \\nbetween shores of cloud. \\n\\nTreebeard strode up the slope, hardly slackening his pace. Suddenly \\nbefore them the hobbits saw a wide opening. Two great trees stood there, one \\non either side, like living gate-posts; but there was no gate save their \\ncrossing and interwoven boughs. As the old Ent approached, the trees lifted \\nup their branches, and all their leaves quivered and rustled. For they were \\nevergreen trees, and their leaves were dark and polished, and gleamed in the \\ntwilight. Beyond them was a wide level space, as though the floor of a great \\nhall had been cut in the side of the hill. On either hand the walls sloped \\nupwards, until they were fifty feet high or more, and along each wall stood \\nan aisle of trees that also increased in height as they marched inwards. \\n\\nAt the far end the rock-wall was sheer, but at the bottom it had been \\nhollowed back into a shallow bay with an arched roof: the only roof of the \\nhall, save the branches of the trees, which at the inner end overshadowed \\nall the ground leaving only a broad open path in the middle. A little stream \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nescaped from the springs above, and leaving the main water, fell tinkling \\ndown the sheer face of the wall, pouring in silver drops, like a fine \\ncurtain in front of the arched bay. The water was gathered again into a \\nstone basin in the floor between the trees, and thence it spilled and flowed \\naway beside the open path, out to rejoin the Entwash in its journey through \\nthe forest. \\n\\n\\'Hm! Here we are!\\' said Treebeard, breaking his long silence. \\'I have \\nbrought you about seventy thousand ent-strides, but what that comes to in \\nthe measurement of your land I do not know. Anyhow we are near the roots of \\nthe Last Mountain. Part of the name of this place might be Wellinghall, if \\nit were turned into your language. I like it. We will stay here tonight.\\' He \\nset them down on the grass between the aisles of the trees, and they \\nfollowed him towards the great arch. The hobbits now noticed that as he \\nwalked his knees hardly bent, but his legs opened in a great stride. He \\nplanted his big toes (and they were indeed big, and very broad) on the \\nground first, before any other part of his feet. \\n\\nFor a moment Treebeard stood under the rain of the falling spring, and \\ntook a deep breath; then he laughed, and passed inside. A great stone table \\nstood there, but no chairs. At the back of the bay it was already quite \\ndark. Treebeard lifted two great vessels and stood them on the table. They \\nseemed to be filled with water; but he held his hands over them, and \\nimmediately they began to glow, one with a golden and the other with a rich \\ngreen light; and the blending of the two lights lit the bay; as if the sun \\nof summer was shining through a roof of young leaves. Looking back, the \\nhobbits saw that the trees in the court had also begun to glow, faintly at \\nfirst, but steadily quickening, until every leaf was edged with light: some \\ngreen, some gold, some red as copper; while the tree-trunks looked like \\npillars moulded out of luminous stone. \\n\\n\\'Well, well, now we can talk again,\\' said Treebeard. \\'You are thirsty I \\nexpect. Perhaps you are also tired. Drink this!\\' He went to the back of the \\nbay, and then they saw that several tall stone jars stood there, with heavy \\nlids. He removed one of the lids, and dipped in a great ladle, and with it \\nfilled three bowls, one very large bowl, and two smaller ones. \\n\\n\\'This is an ent-house,\\' he said, \\'and there are no seats, I fear. But \\nyou may sit on the table.\\' Picking up the hobbits he set them on the great \\nstone slab, six feet above the ground, and there they sat dangling their \\nlegs, and drinking in sips. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe drink was like water, indeed very like the taste of the draughts \\nthey had drunk from the Entwash near, the borders of the forest, and yet \\nthere was some scent or savour in it which they could not describe: it was \\nfaint, but it reminded them of the smell of a distant wood borne from afar \\nby a cool breeze at night. The effect of the draught began at the toes, and \\nrose steadily through every limb, bringing refreshment and vigour as it \\ncoursed upwards, right to the tips of the hair. Indeed the hobbits felt that \\nthe hair on their heads was actually standing up, waving and curling and \\ngrowing. As for Treebeard, he first laved his feet in the basin beyond the \\narch, and then he drained his bowl at one draught, one long, slow draught. \\nThe hobbits thought he would never stop. \\n\\nAt last he set the bowl down again. \\'Ah -- ah,\\' he sighed. \\'Hm, hoom, \\nnow we can talk easier. You can sit on the floor, and I will lie down; that \\nwill prevent this drink from rising to my head and sending me to sleep.\\' \\n\\nOn the right side of the bay there was a great bed on low legs; not \\nmore than a couple of feet high, covered deep in dried grass and bracken. \\nTreebeard lowered himself slowly on to this (with only the slightest sign of \\nbending at his middle), until he lay at full length, with his arms behind \\nhis head, looking up at the ceiling, upon which lights were flickering, like \\nthe play of leaves in the sunshine. Merry and Pippin sat beside him on \\npillows of grass. \\n\\n\\'Now tell me your tale, and do not hurry!\\' said Treebeard. \\n\\nThe hobbits began to tell him the story of their adventures ever since \\nthey left Hobbiton. They followed no very clear order, for they interrupted \\none another continually, and Treebeard often stopped the speaker, and went \\nback to some earlier point, or jumped forward asking questions about later \\nevents. They said nothing whatever about the Ring, and did not tell him why \\nthey set out or where they were going to; and he did not ask for any \\nreasons. \\n\\nHe was immensely interested in everything: in the Black Riders, in \\nElrond, and Rivendell, in the Old Forest, and Tom Bombadil, in the Mines of \\nMoria, and in Lothlurien and Galadriel. He made them describe the Shire and \\nits country over and over again. He said an odd thing at this point. \\'You \\nnever see any, hm, any Ents round there do you?\\' he asked. \\'Well, not Ents, \\nEntwives I should really say.\\' \\n\\nEntwivesT said Pippin. \\'Are they like you at all?\\' \\n\\nYes, hm, well no: I do not really know now, said Treebeard \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthoughtfully. \\'But they would like your country, so I just wondered.\\' \\n\\nTreebeard was however especially interested in everything that \\nconcerned Gandalf; and most interested of all in Saruman\\'s doings. The \\nhobbits regretted very much that they knew so little about them: only a \\nrather vague report by Sam of what Gandalf had told the Council. But they \\nwere clear at any rate that UgKDk and his troop came from Isengard, and \\nspoke of Saruman as their master. \\n\\n\\'Hm, hoom!\\' said Treebeard, when at last their story had wound and \\nwandered down to the battle of the Ores and the Riders of Rohan. \\'Well, \\nwell! That is a bundle of news and no mistake. You have not told me all, no \\nindeed, not by a long way. But I do not doubt that you are doing as Gandalf \\nwould wish. There is something very big going on, that I can see, and what \\nit is maybe I shall learn in good time, or in bad time. By root and twig, \\nbut it is a strange business: up sprout a little folk that are not in the \\nold lists, and behold the Nine forgotten Riders reappear to hunt them, and \\nGandalf takes them on a great journey, and Galadriel harbours them in Caras \\nGaladhon, and Ores pursue them down all the leagues of Wilderland: indeed \\nthey seem to be caught up in a great storm. I hope they weather it!\\' \\n\\n\\'And what about yourself?\\' asked Merry. \\n\\n\\'Hoom, hm, I have not troubled about the Great Wars,\\' said Treebeard; \\n\\'they mostly concern Elves and Men. That is the business of Wizards: Wizards \\nare always troubled about the future. I do not like worrying about the \\nfuture. I am not altogether on anybody\\'s side, because nobody is altogether \\non my side, if you understand me: nobody cares for the woods as I care for \\nthem, not even Elves nowadays. Still, I take more kindly to Elves than to \\nothers: it was the Elves that cured us of dumbness long ago, and that was a \\ngreat gift that cannot be forgotten, though our ways have parted since. And \\nthere are some things, of course, whose side I am altogether not on; I am \\nagainst them altogether: these -- burbrum\\' (he again made a deep rumble of \\ndisgust)\\' -- these Ores, and their masters. \\n\\n\\'I used to be anxious when the shadow lay on Mirkwood, but when it \\nremoved to Mordor, I did not trouble for a while: Mordor is a long way away. \\nBut it seems that the wind is setting East, and the withering of all woods \\nmay be drawing near. There is naught that an old Ent can do to hold back \\nthat storm: he must weather it or crack. \\n\\n\\'But Saruman now! Saruman is a neighbour: I cannot overlook him. I must \\ndo something. I suppose. I have often wondered lately what I should do about \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSaruman.\\' \\n\\n\\'Who is Saruman?\\' asked Pippin. \\'Do you know anything about his \\nhistory?\\' \\'Saruman is a Wizard,\\' answered Treebeard. \\'More than that I \\ncannot say. I do not know the history of Wizards. They appeared first after \\nthe Great Ships came over the Sea; but if they came with the Ships I never \\ncan tell. Saruman was reckoned great among them. I believe. He gave up \\nwandering about and minding the affairs of Men and Elves, some time ago -- \\nyou would call it a very long time ago: and he settled down at Angrenost, or \\nIsengard as the Men of Rohan call it. He was very quiet to begin with, but \\nhis fame began to grow. He was chosen to be head of the White Council, they \\nsay; but that did not turn out too well. I wonder now if even then Saruman \\nwas not turning to evil ways. But at any rate he used to give no trouble to \\nhis neighbours. I used to talk to him. There was a time when he was always \\nwalking about my woods. He was polite in those days, always asking my leave \\n(at least when he met me); and always eager to listen. I told him many \\nthings that he would never have found out by himself; but he never repaid me \\nin like kind. I cannot remember that he ever told, me anything. And he got \\nmore and more like that; his face, as I remember it-I have not seen it for \\nmany a day-became like windows in a stone wall: windows with shutters \\ninside. \\n\\n\\'I think that I now understand what he is up to. He is plotting to \\nbecome a Power. He has a mind of metal and wheels; and he does not care for \\ngrowing things, except as far as they serve him for the moment. And now it \\nis clear that he is a black traitor. He has taken up with foul folk, with \\nthe Ores. Brm, hoom! Worse than that: he has been doing something to them; \\nsomething dangerous. For these Isengarders are more like wicked Men. It is a \\nmark of evil things that came in the Great Darkness that they cannot abide \\nthe Sun; but Saruman\\'s Ores can endure it, even if they hate it. I wonder \\nwhat he has done? Are they Men he has ruined, or has he blended the races of \\nOres and Men? That would be a black evil!\\' \\n\\nTreebeard rumbled for a moment, as if he were pronouncing some deep, \\nsubterranean Entish malediction. \\'Some time ago I began to wonder how Ores \\ndared to pass through my woods so freely,\\' he went on. \\'Only lately did I \\nguess that Saruman was to blame, and that long ago he had been spying out \\nall the ways, and discovering my secrets. He and his foul folk are making \\nhavoc now. Down on the borders they are felling trees-good trees. Some of \\nthe trees they just cut down and leave to rot -- ore-mischief that; but most \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nare hewn up and carried off to feed the fires of Orthanc. There is always a \\nsmoke rising from Isengard these days. \\n\\n\\'Curse him, root and branch! Many of those trees were my friends \\ncreatures I had known from nut and acorn; many had voices of their own that \\nare lost for ever now. And there are wastes of stump and bramble where once \\nthere were singing groves. I have been idle. I have let things slip. It must \\nstop!\\' \\n\\nTreebeard raised himself from his bed with a jerk, stood up, and \\nthumped his hand on the table. The vessels of light trembled and sent up two \\njets of flame. There was a flicker like green fire in his eyes, and his \\nbeard stood out stiff as a great besom. \\n\\n\\'I will stop it!\\' he boomed. \\'And you shall come with me. You may be \\nable to help me. You will be helping your own friends that way, too; for if \\nSaruman is not checked Rohan and Gondor will have an enemy behind as well \\nas \\n\\nin front. Our roads go together -- to Isengard!\\' \\n\\n\\'We will come with you,\\' said Merry. \\'We will do what we can.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes!\\' said Pippin. \\'I should like to see the White Hand overthrown. I \\nshould like to be there, even if I could not be of much use: I shall never \\nforget Ugl(r)k and the crossing of Rohan.\\' \\n\\n\\'Good! Good!\\' said Treebeard. \\'But I spoke hastily. We must not be \\nhasty. I have become too hot. I must cool myself and think; fur it is easier \\nto shout stop\\\\ than to do it.\\' \\n\\nHe strode to the archway and stood for some time under the falling rain \\nof the spring. Then he laughed and shook himself, and wherever the drops of \\nwater fell glittering from him to the ground they glinted like red and green \\nsparks. He came back and laid himself on the bed again and was silent. \\n\\nAfter some time the hobbits heard him murmuring again. He seemed to be \\ncounting on his fingers. \\'Fangorn, Finglas, Fladrif, aye, aye,\\' he sighed. \\n\\n\\'The trouble is that there are so few of us left,\\' he said turning towards \\nthe hobbits. \\'Only three remain of the first Ents that walked in the woods \\nbefore the Darkness: only myself, Fangorn, and Finglas and Fladrif -- to \\ngive them their Elvish names; you may call them Leaflock and Skinbark if you \\nlike that better. And of us three Leaflock and Skinbark are not much use for \\nthis business. Leaflock has grown sleepy, almost tree-ish, you might say: he \\nhas taken to standing by himself half-asleep all through the summer with the \\ndeep grass of the meadows round his knees. Covered with leafy hair he is. He \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nused to rouse up in winter; but of late he has been too drowsy to walk far \\neven then. Skinbark lived on the mountain-slopes west of Isengard. That is \\nwhere the worst trouble has been. He was wounded by the Ores, and many of \\nhis folk and his tree-herds have been murdered and destroyed. He has gone up \\ninto the high places, among the birches that he loves best, and he will not \\ncome down. Still, I daresay I could get together a fair company of our \\nyounger folks-if I could make them understand the need: if I could rouse \\nthem: we are not a hasty folk. What a pity there are so few of us!\\' \\n\\n\\'Why are there so few when you have lived in this country so long?\\' \\nasked Pippin. \\'Have a great many died?\\' \\n\\n\\'Oh, no!\\' said Treebeard. \\'None have died from inside, as you might \\nsay. Some have fallen in the evil chances of the long years, of course: and \\nmore have grown tree-ish. But there were never many of us and we have not \\nincreased. There have been no Entings -- no children, you would say, not for \\na terrible long count of years. You see, we lost the Entwives.\\' \\n\\n\\'How very sad!\\' said Pippin. \\'How was it that they all died?\\' \\n\\n\\'They did not dieV said Treebeard. \\'I never said died. We lost them, I \\nsaid. We lost them and we cannot find them.\\' He sighed. \\'I thought most folk \\nknew that. There were songs about the hunt of the Ents for the Entwives sung \\namong Elves and Men from Mirkwood to Gondor. They cannot be quite \\nforgotten.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, I am afraid the songs have not come west over the Mountains to \\nthe Shire,\\' said Merry. \\'Won\\'t you tell us some more, or sing us one of the \\nsongs?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, I will indeed,\\' said Treebeard, seeming pleased with the request. \\n\\n\\'But I cannot tell it properly, only in short; and then we must end our \\ntalk: tomorrow we have councils to call, and work to do, and maybe a journey \\nto begin.\\' \\n\\n\\'It is rather a strange and sad story,\\' he went on after a pause. \\'When \\nthe world was young, and the woods were wide and wild, the Ents and the \\nEntwives -- and there were Entmaidens then: ah! the loveliness of \\nFimbrethil, of Wandlimb the lightfooted, in the days of our youth! -- they \\nwalked together and they housed together. But our hearts did not go on \\ngrowing in the same way: the Ents gave their love to things that they met in \\nthe world, and the Entwives gave their thought to other things, for the Ents \\nloved the great trees; and the wild woods, and the slopes of the high hills; \\nand they drank of the mountain-streams, and ate only such fruit as the trees \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nlet fall in their path; and they learned of the Elves and spoke with the \\nTrees. But the Entwives gave their minds to the lesser trees, and to the \\nmeads in the sunshine beyond the feet of the forests; and they saw the sloe \\nin the thicket, and the wild apple and the cherry blossoming in spring, and \\nthe green herbs in the waterlands in summer, and the seeding grasses in the \\nautumn fields. They did not desire to speak with these things; but they \\nwished them to hear and obey what was said to them. The Entwives ordered \\nthem to grow according to their wishes, and bear leaf and fruit to their \\nliking; for the Entwives desired order, and plenty, and peace (by which they \\nmeant that things should remain where they had set them). So the Entwives \\nmade gardens to live in. But we Ents went on wandering, and we only came to \\nthe gardens now and again. Then when the Darkness came in the North, the \\nEntwives crossed the Great River, and made new gardens, and tilled new \\nfields, and we saw them more seldom. After the Darkness was overthrown the \\nland of the Entwives blossomed richly, and their fields were full of corn. \\n\\nMany men learned the crafts of the Entwives and honoured them greatly; but \\nwe were only a legend to them, a secret in the heart of the forest. Yet here \\nwe still are, while all the gardens of the Entwives are wasted: Men call \\nthem the Brown Lands now. \\n\\n\\'I remember it was long ago -- in the time of the war between Sauron \\nand the Men of the Sea -- desire came over me to see Fimbrethil again. Very \\nfair she was still in my eyes, when I had last seen her, though little like \\nthe Entmaiden of old. For the Entwives were bent and browned by their \\nlabour; their hair parched by the sun to the hue of ripe corn and their \\ncheeks like redapples. Yet their eyes were still the eyes of our own \\npeople. We crossed over Anduin and came to their land: but we found a \\ndesert: it was all burned and uprooted, for war had passed over it. But the \\nEntwives were not there. Long we called, and long we searched; and we asked \\nall folk that we met which way the Entwives had gone. Some said they had \\nnever seen them; and some said that they had seen them walking away west, \\nand some said east, and others south. But nowhere that we went could we find \\nthem. Our sorrow was very great. Yet the wild wood called, and we returned \\nto it. For many years we used to go out every now and again and look for the \\nEntwives. walking far and wide and calling them by their beautiful names. \\nBut as time passed we went more seldom and wandered less far. And now the \\nEntwives are only a memory for us, and our beards are long and grey. The \\nElves made many songs concerning the Search of the Ents, and some of the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsongs passed into the tongues of Men. But we made no songs about it, being \\ncontent to chant their beautiful names when we thought of the Entwives. We \\nbelieve that we may meet again in a time to come, and perhaps we shall find \\nsomewhere a land where we can live together and both be content. But it is \\nforeboded that that will only be when we have both lost all that we now \\nhave. And it may well be that that time is drawing near at last. For if \\nSauron of old destroyed the gardens, the Enemy today seems likely to wither \\nall the woods. \\n\\n\\'There was an Elvish song that spoke of this, or at least so I \\nunderstand it. It used to be sung up and down the Great River. It was never \\nan Entish song, mark you: it would have been a very long song in Entish! But \\nwe know it by heart, and hum it now and again. This is how it runs in your \\ntongue: \\n\\nENT. \\n\\nWhen Spring unfolds the beechen leaf, and sap is in the bough; \\n\\nWhen light is on the wild-wood stream, and wind is on the brow; \\n\\nWhen stride is long, and breath is deep, and keen the mountain-air, \\n\\nCome back to me! Come back to me, and say my land is fair! \\n\\nentwife. \\n\\nWhen Spring is come to garth and field, and corn is in the blade; \\n\\nWhen blossom like a shining snow is on the orchard laid; \\n\\nWhen shower and Sun upon the Earth with fragrance fill the air, \\n\\nI\\'ll linger here, and will not come, because my land is fair. \\n\\nent. \\n\\nWhen Summer lies upon the world, and in a noon of gold \\n\\nBeneath the roof of sleeping leaves the dreams of trees unfold; \\n\\nWhen woodland halls are green and cool, and wind is in the West, \\n\\nCome back to me! Come back to me, and say my land is best! \\n\\nentwife. \\n\\nWhen Summer warms the hanging fruit and burns the berry brown; \\n\\nWhen straw is gold, and ear is white, and harvest comes to town; \\n\\nWhen honey spills, and apple swells, though wind be in the West, \\n\\nI\\'ll linger here beneath the Sun, because my land is best! \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nent. \\n\\nWhen Winter comes, the winter wild that hill and wood shall slay; \\n\\nWhen trees shall fall and starless night devour the sunless day; \\n\\nWhen wind is in the deadly East, then in the bitter rain \\n\\nI\\'ll look for thee, and call to thee; I\\'ll come to thee again! \\n\\nentwife. \\n\\nWhen Winter comes, and singing ends; when darkness falls at last; \\n\\nWhen broken is the barren bough, and light and labour past; \\n\\nI\\'ll look for thee, and wait for thee, until we meet again: \\n\\nTogether we will take the road beneath the bitter rain! \\n\\nboth. \\n\\nTogether we will take the road that leads into the West, \\n\\nAnd far away will find a land where both our hearts may rest. \\' \\n\\nTreebeard ended his song. \\'That is how it goes,\\' he said. \\'It is \\nElvish, of course: lighthearted, quickworded, and soon over. I daresay it is \\nfair enough. But the Ents could say more on their side, if they had time ! \\n\\nBut now I am going to stand up and take a little sleep. Where will you \\nstand?\\' \\n\\n\\'We usually lie down to sleep,\\' said Merry. \\'We shall be all right \\nwhere we are.\\' \\n\\n\\'Lie down to sleep!\\' said Treebeard. \\'Why of course you do! Hm, hoom: I \\nwas forgetting: singing that song put me in mind of old times; almost \\nthought that I was talking to young Entings, I did. Well, you can lie on the \\nbed. I am going to stand in the rain. Good night!\\' \\n\\nMerry and Pippin climbed on to the bed and curled up in the soft grass \\nand fern. It was fresh, and sweet-scented, and warm. The lights died down, \\nand the glow of the trees faded; but outside under the arch they could see \\nold Treebeard standing, motionless, with his arms raised above his head. The \\nbright stars peered out of the sky, and lit the falling water as it spilled \\non to his fingers and head, and dripped, dripped, in hundreds of silver \\ndrops on to his feet. Listening to the tinkling of the drops the hobbits \\nfell asleep. \\n\\nThey woke to find a cool sun shining into the great court, and on to \\nthe floor of the bay. Shreds of high cloud were overhead, running on a stiff \\n\\n\\n\\n\\neasterly wind. Treebeard was not to be seen; but while Merry and Pippin were \\nbathing in the basin by the arch, they heard him humming and singing, as he \\ncame up the path between the trees. \\n\\n\\'Hoo, ho! Good morning, Merry and Pippin!\\' he boomed, when he saw \\nthem. \\n\\n\\'You sleep long. I have been many a hundred strides already today. Now we \\nwill have a drink, and go to Entmoot.\\' \\n\\nHe poured them out two full bowls from a stone jar; but from a \\ndifferent jar. The taste was not the same as it had been the night before: \\nit was earthier and richer, more sustaining and food-like, so to speak. \\n\\nWhile the hobbits drank, sitting on the edge of the bed, and nibbling small \\npieces of elf-cake (more because they felt that eating was a necessary part \\nof breakfast than because they felt hungry), Treebeard stood, humming in \\nEntish or Elvish or some strange tongue, and looking up at the sky. \\n\\n\\'Where is Entmoot?\\' Pippin ventured to ask. \\n\\n\\'Hoo, eh? Entmoot?\\' said Treebeard, turning round. \\'It is not a place, \\nit is a gathering of Ents -- which does not often happen nowadays. But I \\nhave managed to make a fair number promise to come. We shall meet in the \\nplace where we have always met: Derndingle Men call it. It is away south \\nfrom here. We must be there before noon.\\' \\n\\nBefore long they set off. Treebeard carried the hobbits in his arms as \\non the previous day. At the entrance to the court he turned to the right, \\nstepped over the stream, and strode away southwards along the feet of great \\ntumbled slopes where trees were scanty. Above these the hobbits saw thickets \\nof birch and rowan, and beyond them dark climbing pinewoods. Soon \\nTreebeard \\n\\nturned a little away from the hills and plunged into deep groves, where the \\ntrees were larger, taller, and thicker than any that the hobbits had ever \\nseen before. For a while they felt faintly the sense of stifling which they \\nhad noticed when they first ventured into Fangorn, but it soon passed. \\nTreebeard did not talk to them. He hummed to himself deeply and \\nthoughtfully, but Merry and Pippin caught no proper words: it sounded like \\nboom, boom, rumboom, boorar, boom, boom, dahrar boom boom, dahrar \\nboom, and \\n\\nso on with a constant change of note and rhythm. Now and again they thought \\nthey heard an answer, a hum or a quiver of sound, that seemed to come out of \\nthe earth, or from boughs above their heads, or perhaps from the boles of \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe trees; but Treebeard did not stop or turn his head to either side. \\n\\nThey had been going for a long while -- Pippin had tried to keep count \\nof the \\'ent-strides\\' but had failed, getting lost at about three thousand -- \\nwhen Treebeard began to slacken his pace. Suddenly he stopped, put the \\nhobbits down, and raised his curled hands to his mouth so that they made a \\nhollow tube; then he blew or called through them. A great hoom, hom rang out \\nlike a deep-throated horn in the woods, and seemed to echo from the trees. \\n\\nFar off there came from several directions a similar hoom, hom, hoom that \\nwas not an echo but an answer. \\n\\nTreebeard now perched Merry and Pippin on his shoulders and strode on \\nagain, every now and then sending out another horn-call, and each time the \\nanswers came louder and nearer. In this way they came at last to what looked \\nlike an impenetrable wall of dark evergreen trees, trees of a kind that the \\nhobbits had never seen before: they branched out right from the roots, and \\nwere densely clad in dark glossy leaves like thornless holly, and they bore \\nmany stiff upright flower-spikes with large shining olive-coloured buds. \\n\\nTurning to the left and skirting this huge hedge Treebeard came in a \\nfew strides to a narrow entrance. Through it a worn path passed and dived \\nsuddenly down a long steep slope. The hobbits saw that they were descending \\ninto a great dingle, almost as round as a bowl, very wide and deep, crowned \\nat the rim with the high dark evergreen hedge. It was smooth and grassclad \\ninside, and there were no trees except three very tall and beautiful \\nsilver -birches that stood at the bottom of the bowl. Two other paths led \\ndown into the dingle: from the west and from the east. \\n\\nSeveral Ents had already arrived. More were coming in down the other \\npaths, and some were now following Treebeard. As they drew near the hobbits \\ngazed at them. They had expected to see a number of creatures as much like \\nTreebeard as one hobbit is like another (at any rate to a stranger\\'s eye); \\nand they were very much surprised to see nothing of the kind. The Ents were \\nas different from one another as trees from trees: some as different as one \\ntree is from another of the same name but quite different growth and \\nhistory; and some as different as one tree-kind from another, as birch from \\nbeech; oak from fir. There were a few older Ents, bearded and gnarled like \\nhale but ancient trees (though none looked as ancient as Treebeard); and \\nthere were tall strong Ents, clean-limbed and smooth-skinned like \\nforest-trees in their prime; but there were no young Ents, no saplings. \\nAltogether there were about two dozen standing on the wide grassy floor of \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe dingle, and as many more were marching in. \\n\\nAt first Merry and Pippin were struck chiefly by the variety that they \\nsaw: the many shapes, and colours, the differences in girth; and height, and \\nlength of leg and arm; and in the number of toes and fingers (anything from \\nthree to nine). A few seemed more or less related to Treebeard, and reminded \\nthem of beech-trees or oaks. But there were other kinds. Some recalled the \\nchestnut: brown-skinned Ents with large splayfingered hands, and short thick \\nlegs. Some recalled the ash: tall straight grey Ents with many-fingered \\nhands and long legs; some the fir (the tallest Ents), and others the birch, \\nthe rowan, and the linden. But when the Ents all gathered round Treebeard, \\nbowing their heads slightly, murmuring in their slow musical voices, and \\nlooking long and intently at the strangers, then the hobbits saw that they \\nwere all of the same kindred, and all had the same eyes: not all so old or \\nso deep as Treebeard\\'s, but all with the same slow, steady, thoughtful \\nexpression, and the same green flicker. \\n\\nAs soon as the whole company was assembled, standing in a wide circle \\nround Treebeard, a curious and unintelligible conversation began. The Ents \\nbegan to murmur slowly: first one joined and then another, until they were \\nall chanting together in a long rising and falling rhythm, now louder on one \\nside of the ring, now dying away there and rising to a great boom on the \\nother side. Though he could not catch or understand any of the words -- he \\nsupposed the language was Entish -- Pippin found the sound very pleasant to \\nlisten to at first; but gradually his attention wavered. After a long time \\n(and the chant showed no signs of slackening) he found himself wondering, \\nsince Entish was such an \\'unhasty\\' language, whether they had yet got \\nfurther than Good Morning ; and if Treebeard was to call the roll, how many \\ndays it would take to sing all their names. \\'I wonder what the Entish is for \\nyes or no,\\' he thought. He yawned. \\n\\nTreebeard was immediately aware of him. \\'Hm, ha, hey, my Pippin!\\' he \\nsaid, and the other Ents all stopped their chant. \\'You are a hasty folk, I \\nwas forgetting; and anyway it is wearisome listening to a speech you do not \\nunderstand. You may get down now. I have told your names to the Entmoot, \\nand \\n\\nthey have seen you, and they have agreed that you are not Ores, and that a \\nnew line shall be put in the old lists. We have got no further yet, but that \\nis quick work for an Entmoot. You and Merry can stroll about in the dingle, \\nif you like. There is a well of good water, if you need refreshing, away \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyonder in the north bank. There are still some words to speak before the \\nMoot really begins. I will come and see you again, and tell you how things \\nare going.\\' \\n\\nHe put the hobbits down. Before they walked away, they bowed low. This \\nfeat seemed to amuse the Ents very much, to judge by the tone of their \\nmurmurs, and the flicker of their eyes; but they soon turned back to their \\nown business. Merry and Pippin climbed up the path that came in from the \\nwest, and looked through the opening in the great hedge. Long tree-clad \\nslopes rose from the lip of the dingle, and away beyond them, above the \\nfir-trees of the furthest ridge there rose, sharp and white, the peak of a \\nhigh mountain. Southwards to their left they could see the forest falling \\naway down into the grey distance. There far away there was a pale green \\nglimmer that Merry guessed to be a glimpse of the plains of Rohan. \\n\\n\\'I wonder where Isengard is?\\' said Pippin. \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know quite where we are,\\' said Merry; \\'but that peak is \\nprobably Methedras. and as far as I can remember the ring of Isengard lies \\nin a fork or deep cleft at the end of the mountains. It is probably down \\nbehind this great ridge. There seems to be a smoke or haze over there, left \\nof the peak, don\\'t you think?\\' \\n\\n\\'What is Isengard like?\\' said Pippin. \\'I wonder what Ents can do about \\nit anyway.\\' \\'So do I,\\' said Merry. \\'Isengard is a sort of ring of rocks or \\nhills, I think, with a flat space inside and an island or pillar of rock in \\nthe middle, called Orthanc. Saruman has a tower on it. There is a gate, \\nperhaps more than one, in the encircling wall, and I believe there is a \\nstream running through it; it comes out of the mountains, and flows on \\nacross the Gap of Rohan. It does not seem the sort of place for Ents to \\ntackle. But I have an odd feeling about these Ents: somehow I don\\'t think \\nthey are quite as safe and, well funny as they seem. They seem slow, queer, \\nand patient, almost sad; and yet I believe they could be roused. If that \\nhappened, I would rather not be on the other side.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes!\\' said Pippin. \\'I know what you mean. There might be all the \\ndifference between an old cow sitting and thoughtfully chewing, and a bull \\ncharging; and the change might come suddenly. I wonder if Treebeard will \\nrouse them. I am sure he means to try. But they don\\'t like being roused. \\nTreebeard got roused himself last night, and then bottled it up again.\\' \\n\\nThe hobbits turned back. The voices of the Ents were still rising and \\nfalling in their conclave. The sun had now risen high enough to look over \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe high hedge: it gleamed on the tops of the birches and lit the northward \\nside of the dingle with a cool yellow light. There they saw a little \\nglittering fountain. They walked along the rim of the great bowl at the feet \\nof the evergreens-it was pleasant to feel cool grass about their toes again, \\nand not to be in a hurry-and then they climbed down to the gushing water. \\nThey drank a little, a clean, cold, sharp draught, and sat down on a mossy \\nstone, watching the patches of sun on the grass and the shadows of the \\nsailing clouds passing over the floor of the dingle. The murmur of the Ents \\nwent on. It seemed a very strange and remote place, outside their world, and \\nfar from everything that had ever happened to them. A great longing came \\nover them for the faces and voices of their companions, especially for Frodo \\nand Sam, and for Strider. \\n\\nAt last there came a pause in the Ent -voices; and looking up they saw \\nTreebeard coming towards them, with another Ent at his side. \\n\\n\\'Hm, hoom, here I am again,\\' said Treebeard. \\'Are you getting weary, or \\nfeeling impatient, hmm, eh? Well, I am afraid that you must not get \\nimpatient yet. We have finished the first stage now; but I have still got to \\nexplain things again to those that live a long way off, far from Isengard, \\nand those that I could not get round to before the Moot, and after that we \\nshall have to decide what to do. However, deciding what to do does not take \\nEnts so long as going over all the facts and events that they have to make \\nup their minds about. Still, it is no use denying, we shall be here a long \\ntime yet: a couple of days very likely. So I have brought you a companion. \\n\\nHe has an ent-house nearby. Bregalad is his Elvish name. He says he has \\nalready made up his mind and does not need to remain at the Moot. Hm, hm, he \\nis the nearest thing among us to a hasty Ent. You ought to get on together. \\nGood-bye!\\' Treebeard turned and left them. \\n\\nBregalad stood for some time surveying the hobbits solemnly; and they \\nlooked at him, wondering when he would show any signs of \\'hastiness\\'. He was \\ntall, and seemed to be one of the younger Ents; he had smooth shining skin \\non his arms and legs; his lips were ruddy, and his hair was grey-green. He \\ncould bend and sway like a slender tree in the wind. At last he spoke, and \\nhis voice though resonant was higher and clearer than Treebeard\\'s. \\n\\n\\'Ha, hmm, my friends, let us go for a walk!\\' he said. \\'I am Bregalad, \\nthat is Quickbeam in your language. But it is only a nickname, of course. \\n\\nThey have called me that ever since I said yes to an elder Ent before he had \\nfinished his question. Also I drink quickly, and go out while some are still \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwetting their beards. Come with me!\\' \\n\\nHe reached down two shapely arms and gave a long -fingered hand to each \\nof the hobbits. All that day they walked about in the woods with him, \\nsinging, and laughing; for Quickbeam often laughed. He laughed if the sun \\ncame out from behind a cloud, he laughed if they came upon a stream or \\nspring: then he stooped and splashed his feet and head with water; he \\nlaughed sometimes at some sound or whisper in the trees. Whenever he saw a \\nrowan-tree he halted a while with his arms stretched out, and sang, and \\nswayed as he sang. \\n\\nAt nightfall he brought them to his ent -house: nothing more than a \\nmossy stone set upon turves under a green bank. Rowan-trees grew in a circle \\nabout it, and there was water (as in all ent -houses), a spring bubbling out \\nfrom the bank. They talked for a while as darkness fell on the forest. Not \\nfar away the voices of the Entmoot could be heard still going on; but now \\nthey seemed deeper and less leisurely, and every now and again one great \\nvoice would rise in a high and quickening music, while all the others died \\naway. But beside them Bregalad spoke gently in their own tongue, almost \\nwhispering; and they learned that he belonged to Skinbark\\'s people, and the \\ncountry where they had lived had been ravaged. That seemed to the hobbits \\nquite enough to explain his \\'hastiness\\', at least in the matter of Ores. \\n\\n\\'There were rowan-trees in my home,\\' said Bregalad, softly and sadly, \\n\\'rowan-trees that took root when I was an Enting, many many years ago in the \\nquiet of the world. The oldest were planted by the Ents to try and please \\nthe Entwives; but they looked at them and smiled and said that they knew \\nwhere whiter blossom and richer fruit were growing. Yet there are no trees \\nof all that race, the people of the Rose, that are so beautiful to me. And \\nthese trees grew and grew, till the shadow of each was like a green hall, \\nand their red berries in the autumn were a burden, and a beauty and a \\nwonder. Birds used to flock there. I like birds, even when they chatter; and \\nthe rowan has enough and to spare. But the birds became unfriendly and \\ngreedy and tore at the trees, and threw the fruit down and did not eat it. \\n\\nThen Ores came with axes and cut down my trees. I came and called them by \\ntheir long names, but they did not quiver, they did not hear or answer: they \\nlay dead. \\n\\nO Orofarnl, Lassemista, Carnimnril! \\n\\nO rowan fair, upon your hair how white the blossom lay ! \\n\\nO rowan mine, I saw you shine upon a summer\\'s day, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYour rind so bright, your leaves so light, your voice so cool and soft: \\n\\nUpon your head how golden-red the crown you bore aloft! \\n\\nO rowan dead, upon your head your hair is dry and grey; \\n\\nYour crown is spilled, your voice is stilled for ever and a day. \\n\\nO Orofarnl, Lassemista, Carnimnril! \\n\\nThe hobbits fell asleep to the sound of the soft singing of Bregalad, \\nthat seemed to lament in many tongues the fall of trees that he had loved. \\n\\nThe next day they spent also in his company, but they did not go far \\nfrom his \\'house\\'. Most of the time they sat silent under the shelter of the \\nbank; for the wind was colder, and the clouds closer and greyer; there was \\nlittle sunshine, and in the distance the voices of the Ents at the Moot \\nstill rose and fell, sometimes loud and strong, sometimes low and sad, \\nsometimes quickening, sometimes slow and solemn as a dirge. A second night \\ncame and still the Ents held conclave under hurrying clouds and fitful \\nstars. \\n\\nThe third day broke, bleak and windy. At sunrise the Ents\\' voices rose \\nto a great clamour and then died down again. As the morning wore on the wind \\nfell and the air grew heavy with expectancy. The hobbits could see that \\nBregalad was now listening intently, although to them, down in the dell of \\nhis ent -house, the sound of the Moot was faint. \\n\\nThe afternoon came, and the sun, going west towards the mountains, sent \\nout long yellow beams between the cracks and fissures of the clouds. \\nSuddenly they were aware that everything was very quiet; the whole forest \\nstood in listening silence. Of course, the Ent- voices had stopped. What did \\nthat mean? Bregalad was standing up erect and tense, looking back northwards \\ntowards Derndingle. \\n\\nThen with a crash came a great ringing shout: ra-hoom-rah! The trees \\nquivered and bent as if a gust had struck them. There was another pause, and \\nthen a marching music began like solemn drums, and above the rolling beats \\nand booms there welled voices singing high and strong. \\n\\nWe come, we come with roll of drum: ta-runda runda runda rom! \\n\\nThe Ents were coming: ever nearer and louder rose their song: \\n\\nWe come, we come with horn and drum: ta-ryna ryna ryna rom! \\n\\nBregalad picked up the hobbits and strode from his house. \\n\\nBefore long they saw the marching line approaching: the Ents were \\nswinging along with great strides down the slope towards them. Treebeard was \\nat their head, and some fifty followers were behind him, two abreast, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nkeeping step with their feet and beating time with their hands upon their \\nflanks. As they drew near the flash and flicker of their eyes could be seen. \\n\\n\\'Hoom, hom! Here we come with a boom, here we come at last!\\' called \\nTreebeard when he caught sight of Bregalad and the hobbits. \\'Come, join the \\nMoot! We are off. We are off to Isengard!\\' \\n\\nTo Isengard!\\' the Ents cried in many voices. \\n\\n\\'To Isengard!\\' \\n\\nTo Isengard! Though Isengard be ringed and barred with doors of stone; \\n\\nThough Isengard be strong and hard, as cold as stone and bare as bone, \\n\\nWe go, we go, we go to war, to hew the stone and break the door; \\n\\nFor bole and bough are burning now, the furnace roars -- we go to war! \\n\\nTo land of gloom with tramp of doom, with roll of drum, we come, we \\ncome; \\n\\nTo Isengard with doom we come! \\n\\nWith doom we come, with doom we come! \\n\\nSo they sang as they marched southwards. \\n\\nBregalad, his eyes shining, swung into the line beside Treebeard. The \\nold Ent now took the hobbits back, and set them on his shoulders again, and \\nso they rode proudly at the head of the sin ng company with beating hearts \\nand heads held high. Though they ad expected something to happen eventually, \\nthey were amazed at the change that had come over the Ents. It seemed now as \\nsudden as the bursting of a flood that had long been held back by a dike. \\n\\n\\'The Ents made up their minds rather quickly, after all, didn\\'t they?\\' \\n\\nPippin ventured to say after some time, when for a moment the singing \\npaused, and only the beating of hands and feet was heard. \\n\\n\\'Quickly?\\' said Treebeard. \\'Hoom! Yes, indeed. Quicker than I expected. \\nIndeed I have not seen them roused like this for many an age. We Ents do not \\nlike being roused; and we never are roused unless it is clear to us that our \\ntrees and our lives are in great danger. That has not happened in this \\nForest since the wars of Sauron and the Men of the Sea. It is the ore-work, \\nthe wanton hewing -- rbrum -- without even the bad excuse of feeding the \\nfires, that has so angered us; and the treachery of a neighbour, who should \\nhave helped us. Wizards ought to know better: they do know better. There is \\nno curse in Elvish, Entish, or the tongues of Men bad enough for such \\ntreachery. Down with Saruman!\\' \\n\\n\\'Will you really break the doors of Isengard?\\' asked Merry. \\n\\n\\'Ho, hm, well, we could, you know! You do not know, perhaps, how strong \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwe are. Maybe you have heard of Trolls? They are mighty strong. But Trolls \\nare only counterfeits, made by the Enemy in the Great Darkness, in mockery \\nof Ents, as Ores were of Elves. We are stronger than Trolls. We are made of \\nthe bones of the earth. We can split stone like the roots of trees, only \\nquicker, far quicker, if our minds are roused! If we are not hewn down, or \\ndestroyed by fire or blast of sorcery, we could split Isengard into \\nsplinters and crack its walls into rubble.\\' \\n\\n\\'But Saruman will try to stop you. won\\'t he?\\' \\n\\n\\'Hm, ah, yes, that is so. I have not forgotten it. Indeed I have \\nthought long about it. But. you see, many of the Ents are younger than I am. \\nby many lives of trees. They are all roused now. and their mind is all on \\none thing: breaking Isengard. But they will start thinking again before \\nlong; they will cool down a little, when we take our evening drink. What a \\nthirst we shall have! But let them march now and sing! We have a long way to \\ngo, and there is time ahead for thought. It is something to have started.\\' \\n\\nTreebeard marched on, singing with the others for a while. But after a \\ntime his voice died to a murmur and fell silent again. Pippin could see that \\nhis old brow was wrinkled and knotted. At last he looked up, and Pippin \\ncould see a sad look in his eyes, sad but not unhappy. There was a light in \\nthem, as if the green flame had sunk deeper into the dark wells of his \\nthought. \\n\\n\\'Of course, it is likely enough, my friends,\\' he said slowly, \\'likely \\nenough that we are going to our doom: the last march of the Ents. But if we \\nstayed at home and did nothing, doom would find us anyway, sooner or later. \\nThat thought has long been growing in our hearts; and that is why we are \\nmarching now. It was not a hasty resolve. Now at least the last march of the \\nEnts may be worth a song. Aye,\\' he sighed, \\'we may help the other peoples \\nbefore we pass away. Still, I should have liked to see the songs come true \\nabout the Entwives. I should dearly have liked to see Fimbrethil again. But \\nthere, my friends, songs like trees bear fruit only in their own time and \\ntheir own way: and sometimes they are withered untimely.\\' \\n\\nThe Ents went striding on at a great pace. They had descended into a \\nlong fold of the land that fell away southward; now they began to climb up, \\nand up, on to the high western ridge. The woods fell away and they came to \\nscattered groups of birch, and then to bare slopes where only a few gaunt \\npine-trees grew. The sun sank behind the dark hill-back in front. Grey dusk \\nfell. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPippin looked behind. The number of the Ents had grown -- or what was \\nhappening? Where the dim bare slopes that they had crossed should lie, he \\nthought he saw groves of trees. But they were moving! Could it be that the \\ntrees of Fangorn were awake, and the forest was rising, marching over the \\nhills to war? He rubbed his eyes wondering if sleep and shadow had deceived \\nhim; but the great grey shapes moved steadily onward. There was a noise like \\nwind in many branches. The Ents were drawing near the crest of the ridge \\nnow, and all song had ceased. Night fell, and there was silence: nothing was \\nto be heard save a faint quiver of the earth beneath the feet of the Ents, \\nand a rustle, the shade of a whisper as of many drifting leaves. At last \\nthey stood upon the summit, and looked down into a dark pit: the great cleft \\nat the end of the mountains: Nan Curunnr, the Valley of Saruman. \\n\\n\\'Night lies over Isengard,\\' said Treebeard. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 5 . The White Rider \\n\\n\\n\\n\\'My very bones are chilled,\\' said Gimli, flapping his arms and stamping \\nhis feet. Day had come at last. At dawn the companions had made such \\nbreakfast as they could; now in the growing light they were getting ready to \\nsearch the ground again for signs of the hobbits. \\n\\n\\'And do not forget that old man!\\' said Gimli. \\'I should be happier if I \\ncould see the print of a boot.\\' \\n\\n\\'Why would that make you happy?\\' said Legolas. \\n\\n\\'Because an old man with feet that leave marks might be no more than he \\nseemed,\\' answered the Dwarf. \\n\\n\\'Maybe,\\' said the Elf; \\'but a heavy boot might leave no print here: the \\ngrass is deep and springy.\\' \\n\\n\\'That would not baffle a Ranger,\\' said Gimli. \\'A bent blade is enough \\nfor Aragorn to read. But I do not expect him to find any traces. It was an \\nevil phantom of Saruman that we saw last night. I am sure of it, even under \\nthe light of morning. His eyes are looking out on us from Fangorn even now, \\nmaybe.\\' \\n\\n\\'It is likely enough,\\' said Aragorn; \\'yet I am not sure. I am thinking \\nof the horses. You said last night, Gimli, that they were scared away. But I \\ndid not think so. Did you hear them, Legolas? Did they sound to you like \\nbeasts in terror?\\' \\n\\n\\'No,\\' said Legolas. \\'I heard them clearly. But for the darkness and our \\nown fear I should have guessed that they were beasts wild with some sudden \\ngladness. They spoke as horses will when they meet a friend that they have \\nlong missed.\\' \\n\\n\\'So I thought,\\' said Aragorn; \\'but I cannot read the riddle, unless \\nthey return. Come! The light is growing fast. Let us look first and guess \\nlater! We should begin here, near to our own camping-ground, searching \\ncarefully all about, and working up the slope towards the forest. To find \\nthe hobbits is our errand, whatever we may think of our visitor in the \\nnight. If they escaped by some chance, then they must have hidden in the \\ntrees, or they would have been seen. If we find nothing between here and the \\neaves of the wood, then we will make a last search upon the battle-field and \\namong the ashes. But there is little hope there: the horsemen of Rohan did \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntheir work too well.\\' \\n\\nFor some time the companions crawled and groped upon the ground. The \\ntree stood mournfully above them, its dry leaves now hanging limp, and \\nrattling in the chill easterly wind. Aragorn moved slowly away. He came to \\nthe ashes of the watch-fire near the river -bank, and then began to retrace \\nthe ground back towards the knoll where the battle had been fought. Suddenly \\nhe stooped and bent low with his face almost in the grass. Then he called to \\nthe others. They came running up. \\n\\n\\'Here at last we find news!\\' said Aragorn. He lifted up a broken leaf \\nfor them to see, a large pale leaf of golden hue, now fading and turning \\nbrown. \\'Here is a mallorn-leaf of Lurien, and there are small crumbs on it, \\nand a few more crumbs in the grass. And see! there are some pieces of cut \\ncord lying nearby!\\' \\n\\n\\'And here is the knife that cut them!\\' said Gimli. He stooped and drew \\nout of a tussock, into which some heavy foot had trampled it, a short jagged \\nblade. The haft from which it had been snapped was beside it. \\'It was an \\nore-weapon,\\' he said, holding it gingerly, and looking with disgust at the \\ncarved handle: it had been shaped like a hideous head with squinting eyes \\nand leering mouth. \\n\\n\\'Well, here is the strangest riddle that we have yet found!\\' exclaimed \\nLegolas. \\'A bound prisoner escapes both from the Ores and from the \\nsurrounding horsemen. He then stops, while still in the open, and cuts his \\nbonds with an ore-knife. But how and why? For if his legs were tied, how did \\nhe walk? And if his arms were tied, how did he use the knife? And if neither \\nwere tied, why did he cut the cords at all? Being pleased with his skill, he \\nthen sat down and quietly ate some waybread! That at least is enough to show \\nthat he was a hobbit, without the mallorn-leaf. After that, I suppose, he \\nturned his arms into wings and flew away singing into the trees. It should \\nbe easy to find him: we only need wings ourselves!\\' \\n\\n\\'There was sorcery here right enough,\\' said Gimli. \\'What was that old \\nman doing? What have you to say, Aragorn, to the reading of Legolas. Can you \\nbetter it?\\' \\n\\n\\'Maybe, I could,\\' said Aragorn, smiling. \\'There are some other signs \\nnear at hand that you have not considered. I agree that the prisoner was a \\nhobbit and must have had either legs or hands free, before he came here. I \\nguess that it was hands, because the riddle then becomes easier, and also \\nbecause, as I read the marks, he was carried to this point by an Ore. Blood \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwas spilled there, a few paces away, ore-blood. There are deep prints of \\nhoofs all about this spot, and signs that a heavy thing was dragged away. \\n\\nThe Ore was slain by horsemen, and later his body was hauled to the fire. \\n\\nBut the hobbit was not seen: he was not \"in the open\", for it was night and \\nhe still had his elven-cloak. He was exhausted and hungry, and it is not to \\nbe wondered at that, when he had cut his bonds with the knife of his fallen \\nenemy, he rested and ate a little before he crept away. But it is a comfort \\nto know that he had some lembas in his pocket, even though he ran away \\nwithout gear or pack; that, perhaps, is like a hobbit. I say he, though I \\nhope and guess that both Merry and Pippin were here together. There is, \\nhowever, nothing to show that for certain.\\' \\n\\n\\'And how do you suppose that either of our friends came to have a hand \\nfree?\\' asked Gimli. \\n\\n\\'I do not know how it happened,\\' answered Aragorn. \\'Nor do I know why \\nan Ore was carrying them away. Not to help them to escape, we may be sure. \\nNay, rather I think that I now begin to understand a matter that has puzzled \\nme from the beginning: why when Boromir had fallen were the Ores content \\nwith the capture of Merry and Pippin? They did not seek out the rest of us, \\nnor attack our camp; but instead they went with all speed towards Isengard. \\n\\nDid they suppose they had captured the Ring -bearer and his faithful comrade? \\n\\nI think not. Their masters would not dare to give such plain orders to Ores, \\neven if they knew so much themselves; they would not speak openly to them of \\nthe Ring: they are not trusty servants. But I think the Ores had been \\ncommanded to capture hobbits, alive, at all costs. An attempt was made to \\nslip out with the precious prisoners before the battle. Treachery perhaps, \\nlikely enough with such folk; some large and bold Ore may have been trying \\nto escape with the prize alone, for his own ends. There, that is my tale. \\n\\nOthers might be devised. But on this we may count in any case: one at least \\nof our friends escaped. It is our task to find him and help him before we \\nreturn to Rohan. We must not be daunted by Fangorn, since need drove him \\ninto that dark place.\\' \\n\\n\\'I do not know which daunts me more: Fangorn, or the thought of the \\nlong road through Rohan on foot,\\' said Gimli. \\n\\n\\'Then let us go to the forest,\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\nIt was not long before Aragorn found fresh signs. At one point, near \\nthe bank of the Entwash, he came upon footprints: hobbit-prints, but too \\nlight for much to be made of them. Then again beneath the bole of a great \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntree on the very edge of the wood more prints were discovered. The earth was \\nbare and dry, and did not reveal much. \\n\\n\\'One hobbit at least stood here for a while and looked back; and then \\nhe turned away into the forest,\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\n\\'Then we must go in, too,\\' said Gimli. \\'But I do not like the look of \\nthis Fangorn: and we were warned against it. I wish the chase had led \\nanywhere else!\\' \\n\\n\\'I do not think the wood feels evil, whatever tales may say,\\' said \\nLegolas. He stood under the eaves of the forest, stooping forward, as if he \\nwere listening, and peering with wide eyes into the shadows. \\'No, it is not \\nevil; or what evil is in it is far away. I catch only the faintest echoes of \\ndark places where the hearts of the trees are black. There is no malice near \\nus; but there is watchfulness, and anger.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, it has no cause to be angry with me,\\' said Gimli. \\'I have done \\nit no harm. \\' \\n\\n\\'That is just as well,\\' said Legolas. \\'But nonetheless it has suffered \\nharm. There is something happening inside, or going to happen. Do you not \\nfeel the tenseness? It takes my breath.\\' \\n\\n\\'I feel the air is stuffy,\\' said the Dwarf. \\'This wood is lighter than \\nMirkwood, but it is musty and shabby.\\' \\n\\n\\'It is old, very old,\\' said the Elf. \\'So old that almost I feel young \\nagain, as I have not felt since I journeyed with you children. It is old and \\nfull of memory. I could have been happy here, if I had come in days of \\npeace.\\' \\n\\n\\'I dare say you could,\\' snorted Gimli. \\'You are a Wood-elf, anyway, \\nthough Elves of any kind are strange folk. Yet you comfort me. Where you go, \\nI will go. But keep your bow ready to hand, and I will keep my axe loose in \\nmy belt. Not for use on trees,\\' he added hastily, looking up at the tree \\nunder which they stood. \\'I do not wish to meet that old man at unawares \\nwithout an argument ready to hand, that is all. Let us go!\\' \\n\\nWith that the three hunters plunged into the forest of Fangorn. Legolas \\nand Gimli left the tracking to Aragorn. There was little for him to see. The \\nfloor of the forest was dry and covered with a drift of leaves; but guessing \\nthat the fugitives would stay near the water, he returned often to the banks \\nof the stream. So it was that he came upon the place where Merry and Pippin \\nhad drunk and bathed their feet. There plain for all to see were the \\nfootprints of two hobbits, one somewhat smaller than the other. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is good tidings,\\' said Aragorn. \\'Yet the marks are two days old \\nAnd it seems that at this point the hobbits left the water -side.\\' \\n\\nThen what shall we do now?\\' said Gimli. \\'We cannot pursue them through \\nthe whole fastness of Fangorn. We have come ill supplied. If we do not find \\nthem soon, we shall be of no use to them, except to sit down beside them and \\nshow our friendship by starving together.\\' \\n\\n\\'If that is indeed all we can do, then we must do that,\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\n\\'Let us go on.\\' \\n\\nThey came at length to the steep abrupt end of Treebeard\\'s Hill and \\nlooked up at the rock -wall with its rough steps leading to the high shelf. \\nGleams of sun were striking through the hurrying clouds, and the forest now \\nlooked less grey and drear. \\n\\n\\'Let us go up and look about us!\\' said Legolas. \\'I will feel my breath \\nshort. I should like to taste a freer air for a while.\\' \\n\\nThe companions climbed up. Aragorn came last, moving slowly: he was \\nscanning the steps and ledges closely. \\n\\n\\'I am almost sure that the hobbits have been up here,\\' he said. \\'But \\nthere are other marks, very strange marks, which I do not understand. I \\nwonder if we can see anything from this ledge which will help us to guess \\nwhich way they went next?\\' \\n\\nHe stood up and looked about, but he saw nothing that was of any use. \\nThe shelf faced southward and eastward; but only on the east was the view \\nopen. There he could see the heads of the trees descending in ranks towards \\nthe plain from which they had come. \\n\\n\\'We have journeyed a long way round,\\' said Legolas. \\'We could have all \\ncome here safe together, if we had left the Great River on the second or \\nthird day and struck west. Few can foresee whither their road will lead \\nthem, till they come to its end.\\' \\n\\n\\'But we did not wish to come to Fangorn,\\' said Gimli. \\n\\n\\'Yet here we are-and nicely caught in the net,\\' said Legolas. \\'Look!\\' \\n\\n\\'Look at what?\\' said Gimli. \\n\\n\\'There in the trees.\\' \\n\\n\\'Where? I have not elf-eyes.\\' \\n\\n\\'Hush! Speak more softly! Look!\\' said Legolas pointing. \\'Down in the \\nwood, back in the Way that we have just come. It is he. Cannot you see him, \\npassing from tree to tree?\\' \\n\\n\\'I see, I see now!\\' hissed Gimli. \\'Look, Aragorn! Did I not warn you? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is the old man. All in dirty grey rags: that is why I could not see \\nhim at first.\\' \\n\\nAragorn looked and beheld a bent figure moving slowly. It was not far \\naway. It looked like an old beggar-man, walking wearily, leaning on a rough \\nstaff. His head was bowed, and he did not look towards them. In other lands \\nthey would have greeted him with kind words; but now they stood silent, each \\nfeeling a strange expectancy: something was approaching that held a hidden \\npower-or menace. \\n\\nGimli gazed with wide eyes for a while, as step by step the figure drew \\nnearer. Then suddenly, unable to contain himself longer, he burst out: \\'Your \\nbow, Legolas! Bend it! Get ready! It is Saruman. Do not let him speak, or \\nput a spell upon us! Shoot first!\\' \\n\\nLegolas took his bow and bent it, slowly and as if some other will \\nresisted him. He held an arrow loosely in his hand but did not fit it to the \\nstring. Aragorn stood silent, his face was watchful and intent. \\n\\n\\'Why are you waiting? What is the matter with you?\\' said Gimli in a \\nhissing whisper. \\n\\n\\'Legolas is right,\\' said Aragorn quietly. \\'We may not shoot an old man \\nso, at unawares and unchallenged, whatever fear or doubt be on us. Watch and \\nwait!\\' \\n\\nAt that moment the old man quickened his pace and came with surprising \\nspeed to the foot of the rock-wall. Then suddenly he looked up, while they \\nstood motionless looking down. There was no sound. \\n\\nThey could not see his face: he was hooded, and above the hood he wore \\na wide-brimmed hat, so that all his features were over-shadowed, except for \\nthe end of his nose and his grey beard. Yet it seemed to Aragorn that he \\ncaught the gleam of eyes keen and bright from within the shadow of the \\nhooded brows. \\n\\nAt last the old man broke the silence. \\'Well met indeed, my friends,\\' \\nhe said in a soft voice. \\'I wish to speak to you. Will you come down or \\nshall I come up?\\' Without waiting for an answer he began to climb. \\n\\n\\'Now!\\' said Gimli. \\'Stop him, Legolas!\\' \\n\\n\\'Did I not say that I wished to speak to you?\\' said the old man. \\'Put \\naway that bow, Master Elf!\\' \\n\\nThe bow and arrow fell from Legolas\\' hands, and his arms hung loose at \\nhis sides. \\n\\n\\'And you, Master Dwarf, pray take your hand from your axe-haft, till I \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nam up! You will not need such arguments.\\' \\n\\nGimli started and then stood still as stone, staring, while the old man \\nsprang up the rough steps as nimbly as a goat. All weariness seemed to have \\nleft him. As he stepped up on to the shelf there was a gleam, too brief for \\ncertainty, a quick glint of white, as if some garment shrouded by the grey \\nrags had been for an instant revealed The intake of Gimli\\'s breath could be \\nheard as a loud hiss in the silence. \\n\\n\\'Well met, I say again!\\' said the old man, coming towards them. When he \\nwas a few feet away, he stood, stooping over his staff, with his head thrust \\nforward, peering at them from under his hood. \\'And what may you be doing in \\nthese parts? An Elf, a Man, and a Dwarf, all clad in elvish fashion. No \\ndoubt there is a tale worth hearing behind it all. Such things are not often \\nseen here.\\' \\n\\n\\'You speak as one that knows Fangorn well,\\' said Aragorn. \\'Is that so?\\' \\n\\n\\'Not well,\\' said the old man: \\'that would be the study of many lives. \\n\\nBut I come here now and again.\\' \\n\\n\\'Might we know your name, and then hear what it is that you have to say \\nto us?\\' said Aragorn. \\'The morning passes, and we have an errand that will \\nnot wait.\\' \\n\\n\\'As for what I wished to say, I have said it: What may you be doing, \\nand what tale can you tell of yourselves? As for my name!\\' He broke off, \\nlaughing long and softly. Aragorn felt a shudder run through him at the \\nsound, a strange cold thrill; and yet it was not fear or terror that he \\nfelt: rather it was like the sudden bite of a keen air, or the slap of a \\ncold rain that wakes an uneasy sleeper. \\n\\n\\'My name!\\' said the old man again. \\'Have you not guessed it already? \\n\\nYou have heard it before, I think. Yes, you have heard it before. But come \\nnow, what of your tale?\\' \\n\\nThe three companions stood silent and made no answer. \\n\\n\\'There are some who would begin to doubt whether your errand is fit to \\ntell,\\' said the old man. \\'Happily I know something of it. You are tracking \\nthe footsteps of two young hobbits, I believe. Yes, hobbits. Don\\'t stare, as \\nif you had never heard the strange name before. You have, and so have I. \\nWell, they climbed up here the day before yesterday; and they met someone \\nthat they did not expect. Does that comfort you? And now you would like to \\nknow where they were taken? Well, well, maybe I can give you some news \\nabout \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthat. But why are we standing? Your errand, you see, is no longer as urgent \\nas you thought. Let us sit down and be more at ease.\\' \\n\\nThe old man turned away and went towards a heap of fallen stones and \\nrock at the foot of the cliff behind. Immediately, as if a spell had been \\nremoved, the others relaxed and stirred. Gimli\\'s hand went at once to his \\naxe-haft. Aragorn drew his sword. Legolas picked up his bow. \\n\\nThe old man took no notice, but stooped and sat himself on a low flat \\nstone. Then his grey cloak drew apart, and they saw, beyond doubt, that he \\nwas clothed beneath all in white. \\n\\n\\'Saruman!\\' cried Gimli, springing towards him with axe in hand, \\'speak! \\nTell us where you have hidden our friends ! What have you done with them? \\nSpeak, or I will make a dint in your hat that even a wizard will find it \\nhard to deal with!\\' \\n\\nThe old man was too quick for him. He sprang to his feet and leaped to \\nthe top of a large rock. There he stood, grown suddenly tall, towering above \\nthem. His hood and his grey rags were flung away. His white garments shone. \\nHe lifted up his staff, and Gimli\\'s axe leaped from his grasp and fell \\nringing on the ground. The sword of Aragorn, stiff in his motionless hand, \\nblazed with a sudden fire. Legolas gave a great shout and shot an arrow high \\ninto the air: it vanished in a flash of flame. \\n\\n\\'Mithrandir!\\' he cried. \\'Mithrandir!\\' \\n\\n\\'Well met, I say to you again. Legolas!\\' said the old man. \\n\\nThey all gazed at him. His hair was white as snow in the sunshine; and \\ngleaming white was his robe; the eyes under his deep brows were bright, \\npiercing as the rays of the sun; power was in his hand. Between wonder, joy, \\nand fear they stood and found no words to say. \\n\\nAt last Aragorn stirred. \\'Gandalf!\\' he said. \\'Beyond all hope you \\nreturn to us in our need! What veil was over my sight? Gandalf!\\' Gimli said \\nnothing, hut sank to his knees, shading his eyes. \\n\\n\\'Gandalf,\\' the old man repeated, as if recalling from old memory a long \\ndisused word. \\'Yes, that was the name. I was Gandalf.\\' \\n\\nHe stepped down from the rock, and picking up his grey cloak wrapped it \\nabout him: it seemed as if the sun had been shining, but now was hid in \\ncloud again. \\'Yes, you may still call me Gandalf,\\' he said, and the voice \\nwas the voice of their old friend and guide. \\'Get up, my good Gimli! No \\nblame to you, and no harm done to me. Indeed my friends, none of you have \\nany weapon that could hurt me. Be merry! We meet again. At the turn of the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntide. The great storm is coming, but the tide has turned.\\' \\n\\nHe laid his hand on Gimli\\'s head, and the Dwarf looked up and laughed \\nsuddenly. \\'Gandalf!\\' he said. \\'But you are all in white!\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, I am white now,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Indeed I am Saruman, one might \\nalmost say, Saruman as he should have been. But come now, tell me of \\nyourselves! I have passed through fire and deepwater, since we parted. I \\nhave forgotten much that I thought I knew, and learned again much that I had \\nforgotten. I can see many things far off, but many things that are close at \\nhand I cannot see. Tell me of yourselves!\\' \\n\\n\\'What do you wish to know?\\' said Aragorn. \\'All that has happened since \\nwe parted on the bridge would be a long tale. Will you not first give us \\nnews of the hobbits? Did you find them, and are they safe?\\' \\n\\n\\'No, I did not find them,\\' said Gandalf. \\'There was a darkness over the \\nvalleys of the Emyn Muil, and I did not know of their captivity, until the \\neagle told me.\\' \\n\\n\\'The eagle!\\' said Legolas. \\'I have seen an eagle high and far off: the \\nlast time was three days ago, above the Emyn Muil.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Gandalf, \\'that was Gwaihir the Windlord, who rescued me \\nfrom Orthanc. I sent him before me to watch the River and gather tidings. \\n\\nHis sight is keen, but he cannot see all that passes under hill and tree. \\n\\nSome things he has seen, and others I have seen myself. The Ring now has \\npassed beyond my help, or the help of any of the Company that set out from \\nRivendell. Very nearly it was revealed to the Enemy, but it escaped. I had \\nsome part in that: for I sat in a high place, and I strove with the Dark \\nTower; and the Shadow passed. Then I was weary, very weary; and I walked \\nlong in dark thought.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then you know about Frodo!\\' said Gimli. \\'How do things go with him?\\' \\n\\n\\'I cannot say. He was saved from a great peril, but many lie before him \\nstill. He resolved to go alone to Mordor, and he set out: that is all that I \\ncan say.\\' \\n\\n\\'Not alone,\\' said Legolas. \\'We think that Sam went with him.\\' \\n\\n\\'Did he!\\' said Gandalf, and there was a gleam in his eye and a smile on \\nhis face. \\'Did he indeed? It is news to me, yet it does not surprise me. \\n\\nGood! Very good! You lighten my heart. You must tell me more. Now sit by \\nme \\n\\nand tell me the tale of your journey.\\' \\n\\nThe companions sat on the ground at his feet, and Aragorn took up the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntale. For a long while Gandalf said nothing, and he asked no questions. His \\nhands were spread upon his knees, and his eyes were closed. At last when \\nAragorn spoke of the death of Boromir and of his last journey upon the Great \\nRiver, the old man sighed. \\n\\n\\'You have not said all that you know or guess, Aragorn my friend,\\' he \\nsaid quietly. \\'Poor Boromir! I could not see what happened to him. It was a \\nsore trial for such a man: a warrior, and a lord of men. Galadriel told me \\nthat he was in peril. But he escaped in the end. I am glad. It was not in \\nvain that the young hobbits came with us, if only for Boromir\\'s sake. But \\nthat is not the only part they have to play. They were brought to Fangorn, \\nand their coming was like the falling of small stones that starts an \\navalanche in the mountains. Even as we talk here, I hear the first \\nrumblings. Saruman had best not be caught away from home when the dam \\nbursts!\\' \\n\\n\\'In one thing you have not changed, dear friend,\\' said Aragorn: \\'you \\nstill speak in riddles.\\' \\n\\n\\'What? In riddles?\\' said Gandalf. \\'No! For I was talking aloud to \\nmyself. A habit of the old: they choose the wisest person present to speak \\nto; the long explanations needed by the young are wearying.\\' He laughed, but \\nthe sound now seemed warm and kindly as a gleam of sunshine. \\n\\n\\'I am no longer young even in the reckoning of Men of the Ancient \\nHouses,\\' said Aragorn. \\'Will you not open your mind more clearly to me?\\' \\n\\n\\'What then shall I say?\\' said Gandalf, and paused for a while in \\nthought. \\'This in brief is how I see things at the moment, if you wish to \\nhave a piece of my mind as plain as possible. The Enemy, of course, has long \\nknown that the Ring is abroad, and that it is borne by a hobbit. He knows \\nnow the number of our Company that set out from Rivendell, and the kind of \\neach of us. But he does not yet perceive our purpose clearly. He supposes \\nthat we were all going to Minas Tirith; for that is what he would himself \\nhave done in our place. And according to his wisdom it would have been a \\nheavy stroke against his power. Indeed he is in great fear, not knowing what \\nmighty one may suddenly appear, wielding the Ring, and assailing him with \\nwar, seeking to cast him down and take his place. That we should wish to \\ncast him down and have no one in his place is not a thought that occurs to \\nhis mind. That we should try to destroy the Ring itself has not yet entered \\ninto his darkest dream. In which no doubt you will see our good fortune and \\nour hope. For imagining war he has let loose war, believing that he has no \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntime to waste; for he that strikes the first blow, if he strikes it hard \\nenough, may need to strike no more. So the forces that he has long been \\npreparing he is now setting in motion, sooner than he intended. Wise fool. \\n\\nFor if he had used all his power to guard Mordor, so that none could enter, \\nand bent all his guild to the hunting of the Ring, then indeed hope would \\nhave faded: neither Ring nor Bearer could long have eluded him. But now his \\neye gazes abroad rather than near at home; and mostly he looks towards Minas \\nTirith. Very soon now his strength will fall upon it like a storm. \\n\\n\\'For already he knows that the messengers that he sent to waylay the \\nCompany have failed again. They have not found the Ring. Neither have they \\nbrought away any hobbits as hostages. Flad they done even so much as that, it \\nwould have been a heavy blow to us, and it might have been fatal. But let us \\nnot darken our hearts by imagining the trial of their gentle loyalty in the \\nDark Tower. For the Enemy has failed-so far. Thanks to Saruman:\\' \\n\\n\\'Then is not Saruman a traitor?\\' said Gimli. \\n\\n\\'Indeed yes,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Doubly. And is not that strange? Nothing \\nthat we have endured of late has seemed so grievous as the treason of \\nIsengard. Even reckoned as a lord and captain Saruman has grown very strong. \\nHe threatens the Men of Rohan and draws off their help from Minas Tirith, \\neven as the main blow is approaching from the East. Yet a treacherous weapon \\nis ever a danger to the hand. Saruman also had a mind to capture the Ring, \\nfor himself, or at least to snare some hobbits for his evil purposes. So \\nbetween them our enemies have contrived only to bring Merry and Pippin with \\nmarvellous speed, and in the nick of time, to Fangorn, where otherwise they \\nwould never have come at all! \\n\\n\\'Also they have filled themselves with new doubts that disturb their \\nplans. No tidings of the battle will come to Mordor, thanks to the horsemen \\nof Rohan; but the Dark Lord knows that two hobbits were taken in the Emyn \\nMuil and borne away towards Isengard against the will of his own servants. \\n\\nHe now has Isengard to fear as well as Minas Tirith. If Minas Tirith falls, \\nit will go ill with Saruman.\\' \\n\\n\\'It is a pity that our friends lie in between,\\' said Gimli. \\'If no land \\ndivided Isengard and Mordor, then they could fight while we watched and \\nwaited.\\' \\n\\n\\'The victor would emerge stronger than either, and free from doubt,\\' \\nsaid Gandalf. \\'But Isengard cannot fight Mordor, unless Saruman first \\nobtains the Ring. That he will never do now. He does not yet know his peril. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is much that he does not know. He was so eager to lay his hands on his \\nprey that he could not wait at home, and he came forth to meet and to spy on \\nhis messengers. But he came too late, for once, and the battle was over and \\nbeyond his help before he reached these parts. He did not remain here long. \\n\\nI look into his mind and I see his doubt. He has no woodcraft. He believes \\nthat the horsemen slew and burned all upon the field of battle; but he does \\nnot know whether the Ores were bringing any prisoners or not. And he does \\nnot know of the quarrel between his servants and the Ores of Mordor; nor \\ndoes he know of the Winged Messenger.\\' \\n\\n\\'The Winged Messenger!\\' cried Legolas. \\'I shot at him with the bow of \\nGaladriel above Sarn Gebir, and I felled him from the sky. He filled us all \\nwith fear. What new terror is this?\\' \\n\\n\\'One that you cannot slay with arrows,\\' said Gandalf. \\'You only slew \\nhis steed. It was a good deed; but the Rider was soon horsed again. For he \\nwas a Nazgyl, one of the Nine, who ride now upon winged steeds. Soon their \\nterror will overshadow the last armies of our friends, cutting off the sun. \\n\\nBut they have not yet been allowed to cross the River, and Saruman does not \\nknow of this new shape in which the Ringwraiths have been clad. His thought \\nis ever on the Ring. Was it present in the battle? Was it found? What if \\nThjoden, Lord of the Mark, should come by it and learn of its power? That is \\nthe danger that he sees, and he has fled back to Isengard to double and \\ntreble his assault on Rohan. And all the time there is another danger, close \\nat hand, which he does not see, busy with his fiery thoughts. He has \\nforgotten Treebeard.\\' \\n\\n\\'Now you speak to yourself again,\\' said Aragorn with a smile. \\n\\'Treebeard is not known to me. And I have guessed part of Saruman\\'s double \\ntreachery; yet I do not see in what way the coming of two hobbits to Fangorn \\nhas served, save to give us a long and fruitless chase.\\' \\n\\n\\'Wait a minute!\\' cried Gimli. \\'There is another thing that I should \\nlike to know first. Was it you, Gandalf, or Saruman that we saw last night?\\' \\n\\n\\'You certainly did not see me,\\' answered Gandalf, \\'therefore I must \\nguess that you saw Saruman. Evidently we look so much alike that your desire \\nto make an incurable dent in my hat must be excused.\\' \\n\\n\\'Good, good!\\' said Gimli. \\'I am glad that it was not you.\\' \\n\\nGandalf laughed again. \\'Yes, my good Dwarf,\\' he said, \\'it is a comfort \\nnot to be mistaken at all points. Do I not know it only too well! But, of \\ncourse, I never blamed you for your welcome of me. How could I do so, who \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhave so often counselled my friends to suspect even their own hands when \\ndealing with the Enemy. Bless you, Gimli, son of Gluin! Maybe you will see \\nus both together one day and judge between us!\\' \\n\\n\\'But the hobbits!\\' Legolas broke in. \\'We have come far to seek them, \\nand you seem to know where they are. Where are they now?\\' \\n\\n\\'With Treebeard and the Ents,\\' said Gandalf. \\n\\n\\'The Ents!\\' exclaimed Aragorn. \\'Then there is truth in the old legends \\nabout the dwellers in the deep forests and the giant shepherds of the trees? \\n\\nAre there still Ents in the world? I thought they were only a memory of \\nancient days, if indeed they were ever more than a legend of Rohan.\\' \\n\\n\\'A legend of Rohan!\\' cried Legolas. \\'Nay, every Elf in Wilderland has \\nsung songs of the old Onodrim and their long sorrow. Yet even among us they \\nare only a memory. If I were to meet one still walking in this world, then \\nindeed I should feel young again! But Treebeard: that is only a rendering of \\nFangorn into the Common Speech; yet you seem to speak of a person. Who is \\nthis Treebeard?\\' \\n\\n\\'Ah! now you are asking much,\\' said Gandalf. \\'The little that I know of \\nhis long slow story would make a tale for which we have no time now. \\nTreebeard is Fangorn, the guardian of the forest; he is the oldest of the \\nEnts, the oldest living thing that still walks beneath the Sun upon this \\nMiddle-earth. I hope indeed, Legolas, that you may yet meet him. Merry and \\nPippin have been fortunate: they met him here, even where we sit. For he \\ncame here two days ago and bore them away to his dwelling far off by the \\nroots of the mountains. He often comes here, especially when his mind is \\nuneasy, and rumours of the world outside trouble him. I saw him four days \\nago striding among the trees, and I think he saw me, for he paused; but I \\ndid not speak, for I was heavy with thought, and weary after my struggle \\nwith the Eye of Mordor; and he did not speak either, nor call my name.\\' \\n\\n\\'Perhaps he also thought that you were Saruman,\\' said Gimli. \\'But you \\nspeak of him as if he was a friend. I thought Fangorn was dangerous.\\' \\n\\n\\'Dangerous!\\' cried Gandalf. \\'And so am I, very dangerous: more \\ndangerous than anything you will ever meet, unless you are brought alive \\nbefore the seat of the Dark Lord. And Aragorn is dangerous, and Legolas is \\ndangerous. You are beset with dangers, Gimli son of Gluin; for you are \\ndangerous yourself, in your own fashion. Certainly the forest of Fangorn is \\nperilous-not least to those that are too ready with their axes; and Fangorn \\nhimself, he is perilous too; yet he is wise and kindly nonetheless. But now \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhis long slow wrath is brimming over, and all the forest is filled with it. \\n\\nThe coming of the hobbits and the tidings that they brought have spilled it: \\nit will soon be running like a flood; but its tide is turned against Saruman \\nand the axes of Isengard. A thing is about to happen which has not happened \\nsince the Elder Days: the Ents are going to wake up and find that they are \\nstrong.\\' \\n\\n\\'What will they do?\\' asked Legolas in astonishment. \\n\\n\\'I do not know,\\' said Gandalf. \\'I do not think they know themselves. I \\nwonder.\\' He fell silent, his head bowed in thought. \\n\\nThe others looked at him. A gleam of sun through fleeting clouds fell \\non his hands, which lay now upturned on his lap: they seemed to be filled \\nwith light as a cup is with water. At last he looked up and gazed straight \\nat the sun. \\n\\n\\'The morning is wearing away,\\' he said. \\'Soon we must go.\\' \\n\\n\\'Do we go to find our friends and to see Treebeard?\\' asked Aragorn. \\n\\n\\'No,\\' said Gandalf. \\'That is not the road that you must take. I have \\nspoken words of hope. But only of hope. Hope is not victory. War is \\n\\nupon us and all our friends, a war in which only the use of the Ring \\ncould give us surety of victory. It fills me with great sorrow and great \\n\\nfear: for much shall be destroyed and all may be lost. I am Gandalf, \\n\\nGandalf the White, but Black is mightier still.\\' \\n\\nHe rose and gazed out eastward, shading his eyes, as if he saw things \\nfar away that none of them could see. Then he shook his head. \\'No,\\' he said \\nin a soft voice, \\'it has gone beyond our reach. Of that at least let us be \\nglad. We can no longer be tempted to use the Ring. We must go down to face a \\nperil near despair, yet that deadly peril is removed.\\' \\n\\nHe turned. \\'Come, Aragorn son of Arathorn!\\' he said. \\'Do not regret \\nyour choice in the valley of the Emyn Muil, nor call it a vain pursuit. You \\nchose amid doubts the path that seemed right: the choice was just, and it \\nhas been rewarded. For so we have met in time, who otherwise might have met \\ntoo late. But the quest of your companions is over. Your next journey is \\nmarked by your given word. You must go to Edoras and seek out Thjoden in \\nhis \\n\\nhall. For you are needed. The light of And(r)ril must now be uncovered in the \\nbattle for which it has so long waited. There is war in Rohan, and worse \\nevil: it goes ill with Thjoden.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then are we not to see the merry young hobbits again?\\' said Legolas. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'I did not say so,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Who knows? Have patience. Go where \\nyou must go, and hope! To Edoras! I go thither also.\\' \\n\\n\\'It is a long way for a man to walk, young or old,\\' said Aragorn. \\'I \\nfear the battle will be over long ere I come there.\\' \\n\\n\\'We shall see, we shall see,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Will you come now with \\nme?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, we will set out together,\\' said Aragorn. \\'But I do not doubt that \\nyou will come there before me, if you wish.\\' He rose and looked long at \\nGandalf. The others gazed at them in silence as they stood there facing one \\nanother. The grey figure of the Man, Aragorn son of Arathorn, was tall, and \\nstern as stone, his hand upon the hilt of his sword; he looked as if some \\nking out of the mists of the sea had stepped upon the shores of lesser men. \\nBefore him stooped the old figure, white; shining now as if with some light \\nkindled within, bent, laden with years, but holding a power beyond the \\nstrength of kings. \\n\\n\\'Do I not say truly, Gandalf,\\' said Aragorn at last, \\'that you could go \\nwhithersoever you wished quicker than I? And this I also say: you are our \\ncaptain and our banner. The Dark Lord has Nine. But we have One, mightier \\nthan they: the White Rider. He has passed through the fire and the abyss, \\nand they shall fear him. We will go where he leads.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, together we will follow you,\\' said Legolas. \\'But first, it would \\nease my heart, Gandalf, to hear what befell you in Moria. Will you not tell \\nus? Can you not stay even to tell your friends how you were delivered?\\' \\n\\n\\'I have stayed already too long,\\' answered Gandalf. \\'Time is short. But \\nif there were a year to spend, I would not tell you all.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then tell us what you will, and time allows!\\' said Gimli. \\'Come, \\nGandalf, tell us how you fared with the Balrog!\\' \\n\\n\\'Name him not!\\' said Gandalf, and for a moment it seemed that a cloud \\nof pain passed over his face, and he sat silent, looking old as death. \\'Long \\ntime I fell,\\' he said at last, slowly, as if thinking back with difficulty. \\n\\n\\'Long I fell, and he fell with me. His fire was about me. I was burned. Then \\nwe plunged into the deep water and all was dark. Cold it was as the tide of \\ndeath: almost it froze my heart.\\' \\n\\n\\'Deep is the abyss that is spanned by Durin\\'s Bridge, and none has \\nmeasured it,\\' said Gimli. \\n\\n\\'Yet it has a bottom, beyond light and knowledge,\\' said Gandalf. \\n\\'Thither I came at last, to the uttermost foundations of stone. He was with \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nme still. His fire was quenched, but now he was a thing of slime, stronger \\nthan a strangling snake. \\n\\n\\'We fought far under the living earth, where time is not counted. Ever \\nhe clutched me, and ever I hewed him, till at last he fled into dark \\ntunnels. They were not made by Durin\\'s folk, Gimli son of Gluin. Far, far \\nbelow the deepest delving of the Dwarves, the world is gnawed by nameless \\nthings. Even Sauron knows them not. They are older than he. Now I have \\nwalked there, but I will bring no report to darken the light of day. In that \\ndespair my enemy was my only hope, and I pursued him, clutching at his heel. \\nThus he brought me back at last to the secret ways of Khazad-dym: too well \\nhe knew them all. Ever up now we went, until we came to the Endless Stair.\\' \\n\\n\\'Long has that been lost,\\' said Gimli. \\'Many have said that it was \\nnever made save in legend, but others say that it was destroyed.\\' \\n\\n\\'It was made, and it had not been destroyed,\\' said Gandalf. \\'From the \\nlowest dungeon to the highest peak it climbed, ascending in unbroken spiral \\nin many thousand steps, until it issued at last in Durin\\'s Tower carved in \\nthe living rock of Zirak-zigil, the pinnacle of the Silvertine. \\n\\n\\'There upon Celebdil was a lonely window in the snow, and before it lay \\na narrow space, a dizzy eyrie above the mists of the world. The sun shone \\nfiercely there, but all below was wrapped in cloud. Out he sprang, and even \\nas I came behind, he burst into new flame. There was none to see, or perhaps \\nin after ages songs would still be sung of the Battle of the Peak.\\' Suddenly \\nGandalf laughed. \\'But what would they say in song? Those that looked up from \\nafar thought that the mountain was crowned with storm. Thunder they heard, \\nand lightning, they said, smote upon Celebdil, and leaped back broken into \\ntongues of fire. Is not that enough? A great smoke rose about us, vapour and \\nsteam. Ice fell like rain. I threw down my enemy, and he fell from the high \\nplace and broke the mountain-side where he smote it in his ruin. Then \\ndarkness took me; and I strayed out of thought and time, and I wandered far \\non roads that I will not tell. \\n\\n\\'Naked I was sent back -- for a brief time, until my task is done. And \\nnaked I lay upon the mountain-top. The tower behind was crumbled into dust, \\nthe window gone; the ruined stair was choked with burned and broken stone. I \\nwas alone, forgotten, without escape upon the hard horn of the world. There \\nI lay staring upward, while the stars wheeled over, and each day was as long \\nas a life-age of the earth. Faint to my ears came the gathered rumour of all \\nlands: the springing and the dying, the song and the weeping, and the slow \\n\\n\\n\\n\\neverlasting groan of overburdened stone. And so at the last Gwaihir the \\nWindlord found me again, and he took me up and bore me away. \\n\\n\\' \\'Ever am I fated to be your burden, friend at need,\\' I said. \\n\\n1 \\'A burden you have been,\\' he answered, \\'but not so now. Light as a \\nswan\\'s feather in my claw you are. The Sun shines through you. Indeed I do \\nnot think you need me any more: were I to let you fall you would float upon \\nthe wind.\\' \\n\\n\\' \\'Do not let me fall!\\' I gasped, for I felt life in me again. \\'Bear me \\nto Lothlurien!\\' \\n\\n\\' \\'That indeed is the command of the Lady Galadriel who sent me to look \\nfor you,\\' he answered. \\n\\n\\'Thus it was that I came to Caras Galadhon and found you but lately \\ngone. I tarried there in the ageless time of that land where days bring \\nhealing not decay. Healing I found, and I was clothed in white. Counsel I \\ngave and counsel took. Thence by strange roads I came, and messages I bring \\nto some of you. To Aragorn I was bidden to say this: \\n\\nWhere now are the D(r)nedain, Elessar, Elessar? \\n\\nWhy do thy kinsfolk wander afar? \\n\\nNear is the hour when the Lost should come forth, \\n\\nAnd the Grey Company ride from the North. \\n\\nBut dark is the path appointed for thee: \\n\\nThe Dead watch the road that leads to the Sea. \\n\\nTo Legolas she sent this word: \\n\\nLegolas Greenleaf long under tree \\n\\nIn joy thou hast lived. Beware of the Seal \\n\\nIf thou hearest the cry of the gull on the shore, \\n\\nThy heart shall then rest in the forest no more. \\' \\n\\nGandalf fell silent and shut his eyes. \\n\\n\\'Then she sent me no message?\\' said Gimli and bent his head. \\n\\n\\'Dark are her words,\\' said Legolas, \\'and little do they mean to those \\nthat receive them.\\' \\n\\n\\'That is no comfort,\\' said Gimli. \\n\\n\\'What then?\\' said Legolas. \\'Would you have her speak openly to you of \\nyour death?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes. if she had nought else to say.\\' \\n\\n\\'What is that?\\' said Gandalf, opening his eyes. \\'Yes, I think I can \\nguess what her words may mean. Your pardon, Gimli ! I was pondering the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmessages once again. But indeed she sent words to you, and neither dark nor \\nsad. \\n\\n\\' \"To Gimli son of Gluin,\" she said, \"give his Lady\\'s greeting. \\n\\nLock -bearer, wherever thou goest my thought goes with thee. But have a care \\nto lay thine axe to the right tree ! \" \\' \\n\\n\\'In happy hour you have returned to us, Gandalf,\\' cried the Dwarf, \\ncapering as he sang loudly in the strange dwarf-tongue. \\'Come, come!\\' he \\nshouted, swinging his axe. \\'Since Gandalf s head is now sacred, let us find \\none that it is right to cleave!\\' \\n\\n\\'That will not be far to seek,\\' said Gandalf, rising from his seat. \\n\\n\\'Come! We have spent all the time that is allowed to a meeting of parted \\nfriends. Now there is need of haste.\\' \\n\\nHe wrapped himself again in his old tattered cloak, and led the way. \\nFollowing him they descended quickly from the high shelf and made their way \\nback through the forest, down the bank of the Entwash. They spoke no more \\nwords, until they stood again upon the grass beyond the eaves of Fangorn. \\nThere was no sign of their horses to be seen. \\n\\n\\'They have not returned,\\' said Legolas. \\'It will be a weary walk!\\' \\n\\n\\'I shall not walk. Time presses,\\' said Gandalf. Then lifting up his \\nhead he gave a long whistle. So clear and piercing was the note that the \\nothers stood amazed to hear such a sound come from those old bearded lips. \\nThree times he whistled; and then faint and far off it seemed to them that \\nthey heard the whinny of a horse borne up from the plains upon the eastern \\nwind. They waited wondering. Before long there came the sound of hoofs, at \\nfirst hardly more than a tremor of the ground perceptible only to Aragorn as \\nhe lay upon the grass, then growing steadily louder and clearer to a quick \\nbeat. \\n\\n\\'There is more than one horse coming,\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\n\\'Certainly,\\' said Gandalf. \\'We are too great a burden for one.\\' \\n\\n\\'There are three,\\' said Legolas, gazing out over the plain. \\'See how \\nthey run! There is Hasufel, and there is my friend Arod beside him! But \\nthere is another that strides ahead: a very great horse. I have not seen his \\nlike before.\\' \\n\\n\\'Nor will you again,\\' said Gandalf. \\'That is Shadowfax. He is the chief \\nof the Mearas, lords of horses, and not even Thjoden, King of Rohan, has \\never looked on a better. Does he not shine like silver, and run as smoothly \\nas a swift stream? He has come for me: the horse of the White Rider. We are \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngoing to battle together.\\' \\n\\nEven as the old wizard spoke, the great horse came striding up the \\nslope towards them; his coat was glistening and his mane flowing in the wind \\nof his speed. The two others followed, now far behind. As soon as Shadowfax \\nsaw Gandalf, he checked his pace and whinnied loudly; then trotting gently \\nforward he stooped his proud head and nuzzled his great nostrils against the \\nold man\\'s neck. \\n\\nGandalf caressed him. \\'It is a long way from Rivendell, my friend,\\' he \\nsaid; \\'but you are wise and swift and come at need. Far let us ride now \\ntogether, and part not in this world again!\\' \\n\\nSoon the other horses came up and stood quietly by, as if awaiting \\norders. \\'We go at once to Meduseld, the hall of your master, Thjoden,\\' said \\nGandalf, addressing them gravely. They bowed their heads. \\'Time presses, so \\nwith your leave, my friends, we will ride. We beg you to use all the speed \\nthat you can. Hasufel shall bear Aragorn and Arod Legolas. I will set Gimli \\nbefore me, and by his leave Shadowfax shall bear us both. We will wait now \\nonly to drink a little.\\' \\n\\n\\'Now I understand a part of last night\\'s riddle,\\' said Legolas as he \\nsprang lightly upon Arod\\'s back. \\'Whether they fled at first in fear, or \\nnot, our horses met Shadowfax, their chieftain, and greeted him with joy. \\n\\nDid you know that he was at hand, Gandalf?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, I knew,\\' said the wizard. \\'I bent my thought upon him, bidding \\nhim to make haste; for yesterday he was far away in the south of this land. \\nSwiftly may he bear me back again!\\' \\n\\nGandalf spoke now to Shadowfax, and the horse set off at a good pace, \\nyet not beyond the measure of the others. After a little while he turned \\nsuddenly, and choosing a place where the banks were lower, he waded the \\nriver, and then led them away due south into a flat land, treeless and wide. \\n\\nThe wind went like grey waves through the endless miles of grass. There was \\nno sign of road or track, but Shadowfax did not stay or falter. \\n\\n\\'He is steering a straight course now for the halls of Thjoden under \\nthe slopes of the White Mountains,\\' said Gandalf. \\'It will be quicker so. \\n\\nThe ground is firmer in the Eastemnet, where the chief northward track lies, \\nacross the river, but Shadowfax knows the way through every fen and hollow.\\' \\n\\nFor many hours they rode on through the meads and riverlands. Often the \\ngrass was so high that it reached above the knees of the riders, and their \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsteeds seemed to be swimming in a grey-green sea. They came upon many \\nhidden \\n\\npools, and broad acres of sedge waving above wet and treacherous bogs; but \\nShadowfax found the way, and the other horses followed in his swath. Slowly \\nthe sun fell from the sky down into the West. Looking out over the great \\nplain, far away the riders saw it for a moment like a red fire sinking into \\nthe grass. Low upon the edge of sight shoulders of the mountains glinted red \\nupon either side. A smoke seemed to rise up and darken the sun\\'s disc to the \\nhue of blood, as if it had kindled the grass as it passed down under the rim \\nof earth. \\n\\n\\'There lies the Gap of Rohan,\\' said Gandalf. \\'It is now almost due west \\nof us. That way lies Isengard.\\' \\n\\n\\'I see a great smoke,\\' said Legolas. \\'What may that be?\\' \\n\\n\\'Battle and war!\\' said Gandalf. \\'Ride on!\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 6 . The King of the Golden Hall \\n\\n\\n\\nThey rode on through sunset, and slow dusk, and gathering night. When \\nat last they halted and dismounted, even Aragorn was stiff and weary. \\nGandalf only allowed them a few hours\\' rest. Legolas and Gimli slept and \\nAragorn lay flat, stretched upon his back; but Gandalf stood, leaning on his \\nstaff, gazing into the darkness, east and west. All was silent, and there \\nwas no sign or sound of living thing. The night was barred with long clouds, \\nfleeting on a chill wind, when they arose again. Under the cold moon they \\nwent on once more, as swift as by the light of day. \\n\\nHours passed and still they rode on. Gimli nodded and would have fallen \\nfrom his seat, if Gandalf had not clutched and shaken him. Hasufel and Arod, \\nweary but proud, followed their tireless leader, a grey shadow before them \\nhardly to he seen. The miles went by. The waxing moon sank into the cloudy \\nWest. \\n\\nA bitter chill came into the air. Slowly in the East the dark faded to \\na cold grey. Red shafts of light leapt above the black walls of the Emyn \\nMuil far away upon their left. Dawn came clear and bright; a wind swept \\nacross their path, rushing through the bent grasses. Suddenly Shadowfax \\nstood still and neighed. Gandalf pointed ahead. \\n\\n\\'Look!\\' he cried, and they lifted their tired eyes. Before them stood \\nthe mountains of the South: white-tipped and streaked with black. The \\ngrass-lands rolled against the hills that clustered at their feet, and \\nflowed up into many valleys still dim and dark, untouched by the light of \\ndawn, winding their way into the heart of the great mountains. Immediately \\nbefore the travellers the widest of these glens opened like a long gulf \\namong the hills. Far inward they glimpsed a tumbled mountain-mass with one \\ntall peak; at the mouth of the vale there stood like sentinel a lonely \\nheight. About its feet there flowed, as a thread of silver, the stream that \\nissued from the dale; upon its brow they caught, still far away, a glint in \\nthe rising sun, a glimmer of gold. \\'Speak, Legolas!\\' said Gandalf. \\'Tell us \\nwhat you see there before us!\\' \\n\\nLegolas gazed ahead, shading his eyes from the level shafts of the \\nnew-risen sun. \\'I see a white stream that comes down from the snows,\\' he \\nsaid. \\'Where it issues from the shadow of the vale a green hill rises upon \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe east. A dike and mighty wall and thorny fence encircle it. Within there \\nrise the roofs of houses; and in the midst, set upon a green terrace, there \\nstands aloft a great hall of Men. And it seems to my eyes that it is \\nthatched with gold. The light of it shines far over the land. Golden, too, \\nare the posts of its doors. There men in bright mail stand; but all else \\nwithin the courts are yet asleep.\\' \\n\\n\\'Edoras those courts are called,\\' said Gandalf, \\'and Meduseld is that \\ngolden hall. There dwells Thjoden son of Thengel, King of the Mark of Rohan. \\nWe are come with the rising of the day. Now the road lies plain to see \\nbefore us. But we must ride more warily; for war is abroad, and the \\nRohirrim, the Horse-lords, do not sleep, even if it seem so from afar. Draw \\nno weapon, speak no haughty word, I counsel you all, until we are come \\nbefore Thjoden\\'s seat.\\' \\n\\nThe morning was bright and clear about them, and birds were singing, \\nwhen the travellers came to the stream. It ran down swiftly into the plain, \\nand beyond the feet of the hills turned across their path in a wide bend, \\nflowing away east to feed the Entwash far off in its reed-choked beds. The \\nland was green: in the wet meads and along the grassy borders of the stream \\ngrew many willow-trees. Already in this southern land they were blushing red \\nat their fingertips. Feeling the approach of spring. Over the stream there \\nwas a ford between low banks much trampled by the passage of horses. The \\ntravellers passed over and came upon a wide rutted track leading towards the \\nuplands. \\n\\nAt the foot of the walled hill the way ran under the shadow of many \\nmounds, high and green. Upon their western sides the grass was white as with \\na drifted snow: small flowers sprang there like countless stars amid the \\nturf. \\n\\n\\'Look!\\' said Gandalf. \\'How fair are the bright eyes in the grass! \\nEvermind they are called, simbelmynl in this land of Men, for they blossom \\nin all the seasons of the year, and grow where dead men rest. Behold! we are \\ncome to the great barrows where the sires of Thjoden sleep.\\' \\'Seven mounds \\nupon the left, and nine upon the right,\\' said Aragorn. \\'Many long lives of \\nmen it is since the golden hall was built.\\' \\n\\n\\'Five hundred times have the red leaves fallen in Mirkwood in my home \\nsince then,\\' said Legolas, \\'and but a little while does that seem to us.\\' \\n\\n\\'But to the Riders of the Mark it seems so long ago,\\' said Aragorn, \\n\\n\\'that the raising of this house is but a memory of song, and the years \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbefore are lost in the mist of time. Now they call this land their home, \\ntheir own, and their speech is sundered from their northern kin.\\' Then he \\nbegan to chant softly in a slow tongue unknown to the Elf and Dwarf; yet \\nthey listened, for there was a strong music in it. \\n\\nThat, I guess, is the language of the Rohirrim,\\' said Legolas; \\'for it \\nis like to this land itself; rich and rolling in part, and else hard and \\nstern as the mountains. But I cannot guess what it means, save that it is \\nladen with the sadness of Mortal Men.\\' \\n\\n\\'It runs thus in the Common Speech,\\' said Aragorn, \\'as near as I can \\nmake it. \\n\\nWhere now the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing? \\n\\nWhere is the helm and the hauberk, and the bright hair flowing? \\n\\nWhere is the hand on the harpstring, and the red fire glowing? \\n\\nWhere is the spring and the harvest and the tall corn growing? \\n\\nThey have passed like rain on the mountain, like a wind in the meadow; \\n\\nThe days have gone down in the West behind the hills into shadow. \\n\\nWho shall gather the smoke of the dead wood burning, \\n\\nOr behold the flowing years from the Sea returning? \\n\\nThus spoke a forgotten poet long ago in Rohan, recalling how tall and \\nfair was Eorl the Young, who rode down out of the North; and there were \\nwings upon the feet of his steed, Felaruf, father of horses. So men still \\nsing in the evening.\\' \\n\\nWith these words the travellers passed the silent mounds. Following the \\nwinding way up the green shoulders of the hills, they came at last to the \\nwide wind-swept walls and the gates of Edoras. \\n\\nThere sat many men in bright mail, who sprang at once to their feet and \\nbarred the way with spears. \\'Stay, strangers here unknown!\\' they cried in \\nthe tongue of the Riddermark, demanding the names and errand of the \\nstrangers. Wonder was in their eyes but little friendliness; and they looked \\ndarkly upon Gandalf. \\n\\n\\'Well do I understand your speech,\\' he answered in the same language; \\n\\'yet few strangers do so. Why then do you not speak in the Common Tongue, \\nas \\n\\nis the custom in the West, if you wish to be answered?\\' \\n\\n\\'It is the will of Thjoden King that none should enter his gates, save \\nthose who know our tongue and are our friends,\\' replied one of the guards. \\n\\'None are welcome here in days of war but our own folk, and those that come \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfrom Mundburg in the land of Gondor. Who are you that come heedless over \\nthe \\n\\nplain thus strangely clad, riding horses like to our own horses? Long have \\nwe kept guard here, and we have watched you from afar. Never have we seen \\nother riders so strange, nor any horse more proud than is one of these that \\nbear you. He is One of the Mearas, unless our eyes are cheated by some \\nspell. Say, are you not a wizard, some spy from Saruman, or phantoms of his \\ncraft? Speak now and be swift!\\' \\n\\n\\'We are no phantoms,\\' said Aragorn, \\'nor do your eyes cheat you. For \\nindeed these are your own horses that we ride, as you knew well are you \\nasked, I guess. But seldom does thief ride home to the stable. Here are \\nHasufel and Arod, that Jomer, the Third Marshal of the Mark, lent to us, \\nonly two days ago. We bring them back now, even as we promised him. Has \\nnot \\n\\nJomer then returned and given warning of our coming?\\' \\n\\nA troubled look came into the guard\\'s eyes. \\'Of Jomer I have naught to \\nsay,\\' he answered. \\'If what you tell me is truth, then doubtless Thjoden \\nwill have heard of it. Maybe your coming was not wholly unlooked-for. It is \\nbut two nights ago that Wormtongue came to us and said that by the will of \\nThjoden no stranger should pass these gates.\\' \\n\\n\\'Wormtongue?\\' said Gandalf, looking sharply at the guard. \\'Say no more! \\n\\nMy errand is not to Wormtongue, but to the Lord of the Mark himself. I am in \\nhaste. Will you not go or send to say that we are come?\\' His eyes glinted \\nunder his deep brows as he bent his gaze upon the man. \\n\\n\\'Yes, I will go,\\' he answered slowly. \\'But what names shall I report? \\n\\nAnd what shall I say of you? Old and weary you seem now, and yet you are \\nfell and grim beneath, I deem\\' \\n\\n\\'Well do you see and speak,\\' said the wizard. \\'For I am Gandalf. I have \\nreturned. And behold! I too bring back a horse. Here is Shadowfax the Great, \\nwhom no other hand can tame. And here beside me is Aragorn son of \\nArathorn, \\n\\nthe heir of Kings, and it is to Mundburg that he goes. Here also are Legolas \\nthe Elf and Gimli the Dwarf, our comrades. Go now and say to your master \\nthat we are at his gates and would have speech with him, if he will permit \\nus to come into his hall.\\' \\'Strange names you give indeed! But I will report \\nthem as you bid and learn my master\\'s will,\\' said the guard. \\'Wait here a \\nlittle while, and f will bring you such answer as seems good to him. Do not \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhope too much! These are dark days.\\' He went swiftly away, leaving the \\nstrangers in the watchful keeping of his comrades. After some time he \\nreturned. \\'Follow me!\\' he said. \\'Thjoden gives you leave to enter; but any \\nweapon that you bear; be it only a staff, you must leave on the threshold. \\n\\nThe doorwardens will keep them.\\' \\n\\nThe dark gates were swung open. The travellers entered, walking in file \\nbehind their guide. They found a broad path, paved with hewn stones, now \\nwinding upward, now climbing in short flights of well-laid steps. Many \\nhouses built of wood and many dark doors they passed. Beside the way in a \\nstone channel a stream of clear water flowed, sparkling and chattering. At \\nlength they came to the crown of the hill. There stood a high platform above \\na green terrace, at the foot of which a bright spring gushed from a stone \\ncarved in the likeness of a horse\\'s head; beneath was a wide basin from \\nwhich the water, spilled and fed the falling stream. Up the green terrace \\nwent a stair of stone, high and broad, and on either side of the topmost \\nstep were stone-hewn sea, There sat other guards, with drawn swords laid \\nupon their knees. Their golden hair was braided on their shoulders the sun \\nwas blazoned upon their green shields, their long corslets were burnished \\nbright, and when they rose taller they seemed than mortal men. \\n\\n\\'There are the doors before you,\\' said the guide. \\'I must return now to \\nmy duty at the gate. Farewell! And may the Lord of the Mark be gracious to \\nyou!\\' \\n\\nHe turned and went swiftly back down the road. The others climbed the \\nlong stair under the eyes of the tall watchmen. Silent they stood now above \\nand spoke no word, until Gandalf stepped out upon the paved terrace at the \\nstairs head. Then suddenly with clear voices they spoke a courteous greeting \\nin their own tongue. \\n\\nHail, corners from afar!\\' they said, and they turned the hilts of their \\nswords towards the travellers in token of peace. Green gems flashed in the \\nsunlight. Then one of the guards stepped forward and spoke in the Common \\nSpeech. \\n\\n\\'I am the Doorward of Thjoden,\\' he said. \\'Hbma is my name. Here I must \\nbid you lay aside your weapons before you enter.\\' \\n\\nThen Legolas gave into his hand his silver -hafted knife, his quiver and \\nhis bow. \\'Keep these well,\\' he said, \\'for they come from the Golden Wood and \\nthe Lady of Lothlurien gave them to me.\\' \\n\\nWonder came into the man\\'s eyes, and he laid the weapons hastily by the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwall, as if he feared to handle them. \\'No man will touch them I promise \\nyou,\\' he said. \\n\\nAragorn stood a while hesitating. \\'It is not my will,\\' he said, \\'to put \\naside my sword or to deliver And(r)ril to the hand of any other man.\\' \\n\\n\\'It is the will of Thjoden,\\' said Hbma. \\n\\n\\'It is not clear to me that the will of Thjoden son of Thengel even \\nthough he be lord of the Mark, should prevail over the will of Aragorn son \\nof Arathorn, Elendil\\'s heir of Gondor.\\' \\n\\n\\'This is the house of Thjoden, not of Aragorn, even were he King of \\nGondor in the seat of Denethor,\\' said Hbma, stepping swiftly before the \\ndoors and barring the way. His sword was now in his hand and the point \\ntowards the strangers. \\n\\n\\'This is idle talk,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Needless is Thjoden\\'s demand, but \\nit is useless to refuse. A king will have his way in his own hall, be it \\nfolly or wisdom.\\' \\n\\n\\'Truly,\\' said Aragorn. \\'And I would do as the master of the house bade \\nme, were this only a woodman\\'s cot, if I bore now any sword but And(r)ril.\\' \\n\\n\\'Whatever its name may be,\\' said Hbma, \\'here you shall lay it, if you \\nwould not fight alone against all the men in Edoras.\\' \\n\\n\\'Not alone!\\' said Gimli, fingering the blade of his axe, and looking \\ndarkly up at the guard, as if he were a young tree that Gimli had a mind to \\nfell. \\'Not alone!\\' \\n\\n\\'Come, come!\\' said Gandalf. \\'We are all friends here. Or should be; for \\nthe laughter of Mordor will be our only reward, if we quarrel. My errand is \\npressing. Here at least is my sword, goodman Hbma. Keep it well. Glamdring \\nit is called, for the Elves made it long ago. Now let me pass. Come, \\nAragorn!\\' \\n\\nSlowly Aragorn unbuckled his belt and himself set his sword upright \\nagainst the wall. \\'Here I set it,\\' he said; \\'but I command you not to touch \\nit, nor to permit any other to lay hand on it. In this elvish heath dwells \\nthe Blade that was Broken and has been made again. Telchar first wrought it \\nin the deeps of time. Death shall come to any man that draws Elendil\\'s sword \\nsave Elendil\\'s heir.\\' \\n\\nThe guard stepped back and looked with amazement on Aragorn. \\'It seems \\nthat you are come on the wings of song out of the forgotten days he said. It \\nshall be, lord, as you command. \\n\\n\\'Well,\\' said Gimli, \\'if it has And(r)ril to keep it company, my axe may \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstay here, too, without shame\\'; and he laid it on the floor. \\'Now then, if \\nall is as you wish, let us go and speak with your master.\\' \\n\\nThe guard still hesitated. \\'Your staff,\\' he said to Gandalf. \\'Forgive \\nme, but that too must be left at the doors.\\' \\n\\n\\'Foolishness!\\' said Gandalf. \\'Prudence is one thing, but discourtesy is \\nanother. I am old. If I may not lean on my stick as I go, then I will sit \\nout here, until it pleases Thjoden to hobble out himself to speak with me.\\' \\n\\nAragorn laughed. \\'Every man has something too dear to trust to another. \\nBut would you part an old man from his support? Come, will you not let us \\nenter?\\' \\n\\n\\'The staff in the hand of a wizard may be more than a prop for age\\' \\nsaid Hbma. He looked hard at the ash-staff on which Gandalf leaned. \\'Yet in \\ndoubt a man of worth will trust to his own wisdom. I believe you are friends \\nand folk worthy of honour, who have no evil purpose. You may go in.\\' \\n\\nThe guards now lifted the heavy bars of the doors and swung them slowly \\ninwards grumbling on their great hinges. The travellers entered. Inside it \\nseemed dark and warm after the clear air upon the hill. The hall was long \\nand wide and filled with shadows and half lights; mighty pillars upheld its \\nlofty roof. But here and there bright sunbeams fell in glimmering shafts \\nfrom the eastern windows, high under the deep eaves. Through the louver in \\nthe roof, above the thin wisps of issuing smoke, the sky showed pale and \\nblue. As their eyes changed, the travellers perceived that the floor was \\npaved with stones of many hues; branching runes and strange devices \\nintertwined beneath their feet. They saw now that the pillars were richly \\ncarved, gleaming dully with gold and half-seen colours. Many woven cloths \\nwere hung upon the walls, and over their wide spaces marched figures of \\nancient legend, some dim with years, some darkling in the shade. But upon \\none form the sunlight fell: a young man upon a white horse. He was blowing a \\ngreat horn, and his yellow hair was flying in the wind. The horse\\'s head was \\nlifted, and its nostrils were wide and red as it neighed, smelling battle \\nafar. Foaming water, green and white, rushed and curled about its knees. \\n\\n\\'Behold Eorl the Young!\\' said Aragorn. \\'Thus he rode out of the North \\nto the Battle of the Field of Celebrant.\\' \\n\\nNow the four companions went forward, past the clear wood-fire burning \\nupon the long hearth in the midst of the hall. Then they halted. At the far \\nend of the house, beyond the hearth and facing north towards the doors, was \\na dais with three steps; and in the middle of the dais was a great gilded \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchair. Upon it sat a man so bent with age that he seemed almost a dwarf; but \\nhis white hair was long and thick and fell in great braids from beneath a \\nthin golden circle set upon his brow. In the centre upon his forehead shone \\na single white diamond. His beard was laid like snow upon his knees; but his \\neyes still burned with a bright light, glinting as he gazed at the \\nstrangers. Behind his chair stood a woman clad in white. At his feet upon \\nthe steps sat a wizened figure of a man, with a pale wise face and \\nheavy -lidded eyes. \\n\\nThere was a silence. The old man did not move in his chair. At length \\nGandalf spoke. \\'Hail, Thjoden son of Thengel! I have returned. For behold! \\nthe storm comes, and now all friends should gather together, lest each \\nsingly be destroyed.\\' \\n\\nSlowly the old man rose to his feet, leaning heavily upon a short black \\nstaff with a handle of white bone; and now the strangers saw that, bent \\nthough he was, he was still tall and must in youth have been high and proud \\nindeed. \\n\\n\\'I greet you,\\' he said, \\'and maybe you look for welcome. But truth to \\ntell your welcome is doubtful here, Master Gandalf. You have ever been a \\nherald of woe. Troubles follow you like crows, and ever the oftener the \\nworse. I will not deceive you: when I heard that Shadowfax had come back \\nriderless, I rejoiced at the return of the horse, but still more at the lack \\nof the rider; and when Jomer brought the tidings that you had gone at last \\nto your long home, I did not mourn. But news from afar is seldom sooth. Here \\nyou come again! And with you come evils worse than before, as might be \\nexpected. Why should I welcome you, Gandalf Stormcrow? Tell me that.\\' \\nSlowly \\n\\nhe sat down again in his chair. \\n\\n\\'You speak justly, lord,\\' said the pale man sitting upon the steps of \\nthe dais. \\'It is not yet five days since the bitter tidings came that \\nThjodred your son was slain upon the West Marches: your right hand, Second \\nMarshal Of the Mark. In Jomer there is little trust. Few men would be left \\nto guard your walls, if he had been allowed to rule. And even now we learn \\nfrom Gondor that the Dark Lord is stirring in the East. Such is the hour in \\nwhich this wanderer chooses to return. Why indeed should we welcome you, \\nMaster Stormcrow? Lbthspell I name you, Ill-news; and ill news is an ill \\nguest they say.\\' He laughed grimly, as he lifted his heavy lids for a moment \\nand gazed on the strangers with dark eyes. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'You are held wise, my friend Wormtongue, and are doubtless a great \\nsupport to your master,\\' answered Gandalf in a soft voice. \\'Yet in two ways \\nmay a man come with evil tidings, lie may be a worker of evil; or he may be \\nsuch as leaves well alone, and comes only to bring aid in time of need.\\' \\n\\n\\'That is so,\\' said Wormtongue; \\'but there is a third kind: pickers of \\nbones, meddlers in other men\\'s sorrows, carrion-fowl that grow fat on war. \\nWhat aid have you ever brought, Stormcrow? And what aid do you bring now? \\nIt \\n\\nwas aid from us that you sought last time that you were here. Then my lord \\nbade you Choose any horse that you would and be gone; and to the wonder of \\nall you took Shadowfax in your insolence. My lord was sorely grieved; yet to \\nsome it seemed that to speed you from the land the price was not too great. \\n\\nI guess that it is likely to turn out the same once more: you will seek aid \\nrather than render it. Do you bring men? Do you bring horses, swords, \\nspears? That I would call aid; that is our present need. But who are these \\nthat follow at your tail? Three ragged wanderers in grey, and you yourself \\nthe most beggar-like of the four!\\' \\n\\n\\'The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late, Thjoden son of \\nThengel,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Has not the messenger from your gate reported the \\nnames of my companions? Seldom has any lord of Rohan received three \\nsuch \\n\\nguests. Weapons they have laid at your doors that are worth many a mortal \\nman, even the mightiest. Grey is their raiment, for the Elves clad them, and \\nthus they have passed through the shadow of great perils to your hall.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then it is true, as Jomer reported, that you are in league with the \\nSorceress of the Golden Wood?\\' said Wormtongue. \\'It is not to be wondered \\nat: webs of deceit were ever woven in Dwimordene.\\' \\n\\nGimli strode a pace forward, but felt suddenly the hand of Gandalf \\nclutch him by the shoulder, and he halted, standing stiff as stone. \\n\\nIn Dwimordene, in Lurien \\nSeldom have walked the feet of Men, \\n\\nFew mortal eyes have seen the light \\nThat lies there ever, long and bright. \\n\\nGaladriel! Galadriel! \\n\\nClear is the water of your well; \\n\\nWhite is the star in your white hand; \\n\\nUnmarred, unstained is leaf and land \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn Dwimordene, in Lurien \\n\\nMore fair than thoughts of Mortal Men. \\n\\nThus Gandalf softly sang, and then suddenly he changed. Casting his \\ntattered cloak aside, he stood up and leaned no longer on his staff; and he \\nspoke in a clear cold voice. The wise speak only of what they know, Grnma \\nson of Gblmud. A witless worm have you become. Therefore be silent, and \\nkeep \\n\\nyour forked tongue behind your teeth. I have not passed through fire and \\ndeath to bandy crooked words with a serving -man till the lightning falls.\\' \\n\\nHe raised his staff. There was a roll of thunder. The sunlight was blotted \\nout from the eastern windows; the whole hall became suddenly dark as night. \\nThe fire faded to sullen embers. Only Gandalf could be seen, standing white \\nand tall before the blackened hearth. \\n\\nIn the gloom they heard the hiss of Wormtongue\\'s voice: \\'Did I not \\ncounsel you, lord, to forbid his staff? That fool, Hbma, has betrayed us!\\' \\nThere was a flash as if lightning had cloven the roof. Then all was silent. \\nWormtongue sprawled on his face. \\n\\n\\'Now Thjoden son of Thengel, will you hearken to me?\\' said Gandalf. \\'Do \\nyou ask for help?\\' He lifted his staff and pointed to a high window. There \\nthe darkness seemed to clear, and through the opening could be seen, high \\nand far, a patch of shining sky. \\'Not all is dark. Take courage, Lord of the \\nMark; for better help you will not find. No counsel have I to give to those \\nthat despair. Yet counsel I could give, and words I could speak to you. Will \\nyou hear them? They are not for all ears. I bid you come out before your \\ndoors and look abroad. Too long have you sat in shadows and trusted to \\ntwisted tales and crooked promptings.\\' \\n\\nSlowly Thjoden left his chair. A faint light grew in the hall again. \\n\\nThe woman hastened to the king\\'s side, taking his arm, and with faltering \\nsteps the old man came down from the dais and paced softly through the hall. \\nWormtongue remained lying on the floor. They came to the doors and \\nGandalf \\nknocked. \\n\\n\\'Open!\\' he cried. \\'The Lord of the Mark comes forth!\\' \\n\\nThe doors rolled back and a keen air came whistling in. A wind was \\nblowing on the hill. \\'Send your guards down to the stairs foot,\\' said \\nGandalf. \\'And you, lady, leave him a while with me. I will care for him.\\' \\n\\n\\'Go, Jowyn sister-daughter!\\' said the old king. \\'The time for fear is \\n\\n\\n\\n\\npast.\\' \\n\\nThe woman turned and went slowly into the house. As she passed the \\ndoors she turned and looked back. Grave and thoughtful was her glance, as \\nshe looked on the king with cool pity in her eyes. Very fair was her face, \\nand her long hair was like a river of gold. Slender and tall she was in her \\nwhite robe girt with silver; but strong she seemed and stern as steel, a \\ndaughter of kings. Thus Aragorn for the first time in the full light of day \\nbeheld Jowyn, Lady of Rohan, and thought her fair, fair and cold, like a \\nmorning of pale spring that is not yet come to womanhood. And she now was \\nsuddenly aware of him: tall heir of kings, wise with many winters, \\ngreycloaked. Hiding a power that yet she felt. For a moment still as stone \\nshe stood, then turning swiftly she was gone. \\n\\n\\'Now, lord,\\' said Gandalf, \\'look out upon your land! Breathe the free \\nair again!\\' \\n\\nFrom the porch upon the top of the high terrace they could see beyond \\nthe stream the green fields of Rohan fading into distant grey. Curtains of \\nwind-blown rain were slanting down. The sky above and to the west was still \\ndark with thunder, and lightning far away flickered among the tops of hidden \\nhills. But the wind had shifted to the north, and already the storm that had \\ncome out of the East was receding, rolling away southward to the sea. \\nSuddenly through a rent in the clouds behind them a shaft of sun stabbed \\ndown. The falling showers gleamed like silver, and far away the river \\nglittered like a shimmering glass. \\n\\n\\'It is not so dark here,\\' said Thjoden. \\n\\n\\'No,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Nor does age lie so heavily on your shoulders as \\nsome would have you think. Cast aside your prop!\\' \\n\\nFrom the king\\'s hand the black staff fell clattering on the stones. He \\ndrew himself up, slowly, as a man that is stiff from long bending over some \\ndull toil. Now tall and straight he stood, and his eyes were blue as he \\nlooked into the opening sky. \\n\\n\\'Dark have been my dreams of late,\\' he said, \\'but I feel as one \\nnew-awakened. I would now that you had come before, Gandalf. For I fear that \\nalready you have come too late, only to see the last days of my house. Not \\nlong now shall stand the high hall which Brego son of Eorl built. Fire shall \\ndevour the high seat. What is to be done?\\' \\n\\n\\'Much,\\' said Gandalf. \\'But first send for Jomer. Do I not guess rightly \\nthat you hold him prisoner, by the counsel of Grnma, of him that all save \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyou name the Wormtongue?\\' \\n\\n\\'It is true,\\' said Thjoden. \\'He had rebelled against my commands, and \\nthreatened death to Grnma in my hall.\\' \\n\\n\\'A man may love you and yet not love Wormtongue or his counsels\\' said \\nGandalf. \\n\\n\\'That may be. I will do as you ask. Call Hbma to me. Since he proved \\nuntrusty as a doorward, let him become an errand -runner. The guilty shall \\nbring the guilty to judgement,\\' said Thjoden, and his voice was grim, yet he \\nlooked at Gandalf and smiled and as he did so many lines of care were \\nsmoothed away and did not return. \\n\\nWhen Hbma had been summoned and had gone, Gandalf led Thjoden to \\na \\n\\nstone seat, and then sat himself before the king upon the topmost stair. \\nAragorn and his companions stood nearby. \\n\\n\\'There is no time to tell all that you should hear,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Yet \\nif my hope is not cheated, a time will come ere long when I can speak more \\nfully. Behold! you are come into a peril greater even than the wit of \\nWormtongue could weave into your dreams. But see! you dream no longer. \\nYou \\n\\nlive. Gondor and Rohan do not stand alone. The enemy is strong beyond our \\nreckoning, yet we have a hope at which he has not guessed.\\' \\n\\nQuickly now Gandalf spoke. His voice was low and secret, and none save \\nthe king heard what he said. But ever as he spoke the light shone brighter \\nin Thjoden\\'s eye, and at the last he rose from his seat to his full height, \\nand Gandalf beside him, and together they looked out from the high place \\ntowards the East. \\n\\n\\'Verily,\\' said Gandalf, now in a loud voice, keen and clear, \\'that way \\nlies our hope, where sits our greatest fear. Doom hangs still on a thread. \\n\\nYet hope there is still, if we can but stand unconquered for a little \\nwhile.\\' \\n\\nThe others too now turned their eyes eastward. Over the sundering \\nleagues of land, far away they gazed to the edge of sight, and hope and fear \\nbore their thoughts still on, beyond dark mountains to the Land of Shadow. \\nWhere now was the Ring -bearer? How thin indeed was the thread upon \\nwhich \\n\\ndoom still hung! It seemed to Legolas, as he strained his farseeing eyes, \\nthat he caught a glint of white: far away perchance the sun twinkled on a \\n\\n\\n\\n\\npinnacle of the Tower of Guard. And further still, endlessly remote and yet \\na present threat, there was a tiny tongue of flame. \\n\\nSlowly Thjoden sat down again, as if weariness still struggled to \\nmaster him against the will of Gandalf. He turned and looked at his great \\nhouse. \\'Alas!\\' he said, \\'that these evil days should be mine, and should \\ncome in my old age instead of that peace which I have earned. Alas for \\nBoromir the brave! The young perish and the old linger, withering.\\' He \\nclutched his knees with his wrinkled hands. \\n\\n\\'Your fingers would remember their old strength better, if they grasped \\na sword-hilt,\\' said Gandalf. \\n\\nThjoden rose and put his hand to his side; but no sword hung at his \\nbelt. \\'Where has Grnma stowed it?\\' he muttered under his breath. \\n\\n\\'Take this, dear lord!\\' said a clear voice. \\'It was ever at your \\nservice.\\' Two men had come softly up the stair and stood now a few steps \\nfrom the top. Jomer was there. No helm was on his head, no mail was on his \\nbreast, but in his hand he held a drawn sword; and as he knelt he offered \\nthe hilt to his master. \\n\\n\\'How comes this?\\' said Thjoden sternly. He turned towards Jomer and the \\nmen looked in wonder at him, standing now proud and erect. Where was the \\nold \\n\\nman whom they had left crouching in his chair or leaning on his stick? \\n\\n\\'It is my doing, lord,\\' said Hbma, trembling. I understood that Jomer \\nwas to be set free. Such joy was in my heart that maybe I have erred. Yet, \\nsince he was free again, and he a Marshal of the Mark, ! brought him his \\nsword as he bade me.\\' \\n\\n\\'To lay at your feet, my lord,\\' said Jomer. \\n\\nFor a moment of silence Thjoden stood looking down at Jomer as he knelt \\nstill before him. Neither moved. \\n\\n\\'Will you not take the sword?\\' said Gandalf. \\n\\nSlowly Thjoden stretched forth his hand. As his fingers took the hilt, \\nit seemed to the watchers that firmness and strength returned to his thin \\narm. Suddenly he lifted the blade and swung it shimmering and whistling in \\nthe air. Then he gave a great cry. His voice rang clear as he chanted in the \\ntongue of Rohan a call to arms. \\n\\nArise now, arise, Riders of Thjoden! \\n\\nDire deeds awake, dark is it eastward. \\n\\nLet horse be bridled, horn be sounded! \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nForth Eorlingas! \\n\\nThe guards, thinking that they were summoned, sprang up the stair. They \\nlooked at their lord in amazement, and then as one man they drew their \\nswords and laid them at his feet. \\'Command us!\\' they said. \\n\\n\\'Westu Thjoden hbl!\\' cried Jomer. \\'It is a joy to us to see you return \\ninto your own. Never again shall it be said, Gandalf, that you come only \\nwith grief!\\' \\n\\n\\'Take back your sword, Jomer, sister-son!\\' said the king. \\'Go, Hbma, \\nand seek my own sword! Grnma has it in his keeping. Bring him to me also. \\nNow, Gandalf, you said that you had counsel to give, if I would hear it. \\n\\nWhat is your counsel?\\' \\n\\n\\'You have yourself already taken it,\\' answered Gandalf. \\'To put your \\ntrust in Jomer, rather than in a man of crooked mind. To cast aside regret \\nand fear. To do the deed at hand. Every man that can ride should be sent \\nwest at once, as Jomer counselled you: we must first destroy the threat of \\nSaruman, while we have time. If we fail, we fall. If we succeed -- then we \\nwill face the next task. Meanwhile your people that are left, the women and \\nthe children and the old, should stay to the refuges that you have in the \\nmountains. Were they not prepared against just such an evil day as this? Let \\nthem take provision, but delay not, nor burden themselves with treasures, \\ngreat or small. It is their lives that are at stake.\\' \\n\\n\\'This counsel seems good to me now,\\' said Thjoden. \\'Let all my folk get \\nready ! But you my guests-truly you said, Gandalf, that the courtesy of my \\nhall is lessened. You have ridden through the night, and the morning wears \\naway. You have had neither sleep nor food. A guest-house shall be made \\nready: there you shall sleep, when you have eaten.\\' \\n\\n\\'Nay, lord,\\' said Aragorn. \\'There is no rest yet for the weary. The men \\nof Rohan must ride forth today, and we will ride with them, axe, sword, and \\nbow. We did not bring them to rest against your wall, Lord of the Mark. And \\nI promised Jomer that my sword and his should be drawn together.\\' \\n\\n\\'Now indeed there is hope of victory!\\' said Jomer. \\n\\n\\'Hope, yes,\\' said Gandalf. \\'But Isengard is strong. And other perils \\ndraw ever nearer. Do not delay, Thjoden, when we are gone. Lead your people \\nswiftly to the Hold of Dunharrow in the hills!\\' \\n\\n\\'Nay, Gandalf!\\' said the king. \\'You do not know your own skill in \\nhealing. It shall not be so. I myself will go to war, to fall in the front \\nof the battle, if it must be. Thus shall I sleep better.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Then even the defeat of Rohan will be glorious in song,\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\nThe armed men that stood near clashed their weapons, crying: \\'The Lord of \\nthe Mark will ride! Forth Eorlingas!\\' \\n\\n\\'But your people must not be both unarmed and shepherdless\\' said \\nGandalf. \\'Who shall guide them and govern them in your place?\\' \\n\\n\\'I will take thought for that ere I go,\\' answered Thjoden. \\'Here comes \\nmy counsellor.\\' \\n\\nAt that moment Hbma came again from the hall. Behind him cringing \\nbetween two other men, came Grnma the Wormtongue. His face was very \\nwhite. \\n\\nHis eyes blinked in the sunlight. Hbma knelt and presented to Thjoden a long \\nsword in a scabbard clasped with gold and set with green gems. \\'Here, lord, \\nis Herugrim, your ancient blade,\\' he said. \\'It was found in his chest. Loth \\nwas he to render up the keys. Many other things are there which men have \\nmissed.\\' \\n\\n\\'You lie,\\' said Wormtongue. \\'And this sword your master himself gave \\ninto my keeping.\\' \\n\\n\\'And he now requires it of you again,\\' said Thjoden. \\'Does that \\ndisplease you?\\' \\n\\n\\'Assuredly not. lord,\\' said Wormtongue. \\'I care for you and yours as \\nbest I may. But do not weary yourself, or tax too heavily your strength. Let \\nothers deal with these irksome guests. Your meat is about to be set on the \\nboard. Will you not go to it?\\' \\n\\n\\'I will,\\' said Thjoden. \\'And let food for my guests be set on the board \\nbeside me. The host rides today. Send the heralds forth! Let them summon all \\nwho dwell nigh! Every man and strong lad able to bear arms, all who have \\nhorses, let them be ready in the saddle at the gate ere the second hour from \\nnoon!\\' \\n\\n\\'Dear lord!\\' cried Wormtongue. \\'It is as I feared. This wizard has \\nbewitched you. Are none to be left to defend the Golden Hall of your \\nfathers, and all your treasure? None to guard the Lord of the Mark?\\' \\n\\n\\'If this is bewitchment,\\' said Thjoden, \\'it seems to me more wholesome \\nthan your whisperings. Your leechcraft ere long would have had me walking on \\nall fours like a beast. No, not one shall be left, not even Grnma. Grnma \\nshall ride too. Go! You have yet time to clean the rust from your sword.\\' \\n\\n\\'Mercy, lord!\\' whined Wormtongue, grovelling on the ground. \\'Have pity \\non one worn out in your service. Send me not from your side! I at least will \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstand by you when all others have gone. Do not send your faithful Grnma \\naway!\\' \\n\\n\\'You have my pity,\\' said Thjoden. \\'And I do not send you from my side. \\n\\nI go myself to war with my men. I bid you come with me and prove your \\nfaith.\\' \\n\\nWormtongue looked from face to face. In his eyes was the hunted look of \\na beast seeking some gap in the ring of his enemies. He licked his lips with \\na long pale tongue. \\'Such a resolve might be expected from a lord of the \\nHouse of Eorl, old though he be,\\' he said. \\'But those who truly love him \\nwould spare his failing years. Yet I see that I come too late. Others, whom \\nthe death of my lord would perhaps grieve less, have already persuaded him. \\n\\nIf I cannot undo their work, hear me at least in this, lord! One who knows \\nyour mind and honours your commands should be left in Edoras. Appoint a \\nfaithful steward. Let your counsellor Grnma keep all things till your \\nreturn-and I pray that we may see it, though no wise man will deem it \\nhopeful.\\' \\n\\nJomer laughed. \\'And if that plea does not excuse you from war, most \\nnoble Wormtongue,\\' he said, what office of less honour would you accept? To \\ncarry a sack of meal up into the mountains-if any man would trust you with \\nit?\\' \\n\\n\\'Nay, Jomer, you do not fully understand the mind of Master \\nWormtongue,\\' said Gandalf, turning his piercing glance upon him. \\'He is bold \\nand cunning. Even now he plays a game with peril and wins a throw. Hours of \\nmy precious time he has wasted already. \\'Down snake!\\' he said suddenly in a \\nterrible voice. \\'Down on your belly! How long is it since Saruman bought \\nyou? What was the promised price? When all the men were dead, you were to \\npick your share of the treasure, and take the woman you desire? Too long \\nhave you watched her under your eyelids and haunted her steps.\\' \\n\\nJomer grasped his sword. \\'That I knew already,\\' he muttered. \\'For that \\nreason I would have slain him before, forgetting the law of the hall. But \\nthere are other reasons.\\' He stepped forward, but Gandalf stayed him with \\nhis hand. \\n\\n\\'Jowyn is safe now,\\' he said. \\'But you, Wormtongue, you have done what \\nyou could for your true master. Some reward you have earned at least. Yet \\nSaruman is apt to overlook his bargains. I should advise you to go quickly \\nand remind him, lest he forget your faithful service.\\' \\n\\n\\'You lie,\\' said Wormtongue. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'That word comes too oft and easy from your lips,\\' said Gandalf. \\'I do \\nnot lie. See, Thjoden, here is a snake! With safety you cannot take it with \\nyou, nor can you leave it behind. To slay it would be just. But it was not \\nalways as it now is. Once it was a man, and did you service in its fashion. \\nGive him a horse and let him go at once, wherever he chooses. By his choice \\nyou shall judge him.\\' \\n\\n\\'Do you hear this, Wormtongue?\\' said Thjoden. \\'This is your choice: to \\nride with me to war, and let us see in battle whether you are true; or to go \\nnow, whither you will. But then, if ever we meet again, I shall not be \\nmerciful.\\' \\n\\nSlowly Wormtongue rose. He looked at them with half-closed eyes. Last \\nof all he scanned Thjoden\\'s face and opened his mouth as if to speak. Then \\nsuddenly he drew himself up. His hands worked. His eyes glittered. Such \\nmalice was in them that men stepped back from him. He bared his teeth; and \\nthen with a hissing breath he spat before the king\\'s feet, and darting to \\none side, he fled down the stair. \\n\\n\\'After him!\\' said Thjoden. \\'See that he does no harm to any, but do not \\nhurt him or hinder him. Give him a horse, if he wishes it.\\' \\n\\n\\'And if any will bear him,\\' said Jomer. \\n\\nOne of the guards ran down the stair. Another went to the well at the \\nfoot of the terrace and in his helm drew water. With it he washed clean the \\nstones that Wormtongue had defiled. \\n\\n\\'Now my guests, come!\\' said Thjoden. \\'Come and take such refreshment as \\nhaste allows.\\' \\n\\nThey passed back into the great house. Already they heard below them in \\nthe town the heralds crying and the war -horns blowing. For the king was to \\nride forth as soon as the men of the town and those dwelling near could be \\narmed and assembled. \\n\\nAt the king\\'s board sat Jomer and the four guests, and there also \\nwaiting upon the king was the lady Jowyn. They ate and drank swiftly. The \\nothers were silent while Thjoden questioned Gandalf concerning Saruman. \\n\\n\\'How far back his treachery goes, who can guess?\\' said Gandalf. \\'He was \\nnot always evil. Once I do not doubt that he was the friend of Rohan; and \\neven when his heart grew colder, he found you useful still. But for long now \\nhe has plotted your ruin, wearing the mask of Friendship, until he was \\nready. In those years Wormtongue\\'s task was easy, and all that you did was \\nswiftly known in Isengard; for your land was open, and strangers came and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwent. And ever Wormtongue\\'s whispering was in your ears, poisoning your \\nthought, chilling your heart, weakening your limbs, while others watched and \\ncould do nothing, for your will was in his keeping. \\n\\n\\'But when I escaped and warned you, then the mask was torn, for those \\nwho would see. After that Wormtongue played dangerously, always seeking \\nto \\n\\ndelay you, to prevent your full strength being gathered. He was crafty: \\ndulling men\\'s wariness, or working on their fears, as served the occasion. \\n\\nDo you not remember how eagerly he urged that no man should be spared on \\na \\n\\nwildgoose chase northward, when the immediate peril was westward? He \\npersuaded you to forbid Jomer to pursue the raiding Ores. If Jomer had not \\ndefied Wormtongue\\'s voice speaking with your mouth, those Ores would \\nhave \\n\\nreached Isengard by now, bearing a great prize. Not indeed that prize which \\nSaruman desires above all else, but at the least two members of my Company, \\nsharers of a secret hope, of which even to you, lord, I cannot yet speak \\nopenly. Dare you think of what they might now be suffering, or what Saruman \\nmight now have learned to our destruction?\\' \\n\\n\\'I owe much to Jomer,\\' said Thjoden. \\'Faithful heart may have forward \\ntongue.\\' \\'Say also,\\' said Gandalf, \\'that to crooked eyes truth may wear a \\nwry face.\\' \\n\\n\\'Indeed my eyes were almost blind,\\' said Thjoden. \\'Most of all I owe to \\nyou, my guest. Once again you have come in time. I would give you a gift ere \\nwe go, at your own choosing. You have only to name aught that is mine. I \\nreserve now only my sword!\\' \\n\\n\\'Whether I came in time or not is yet to be seen,\\' said Gandalf. \\'But \\nas for your gift, lord, I will choose one that will fit my need: swift and \\nsure. Give me Shadowfax! He was only lent before, if loan we may call it. \\nBut now shall ride him into great hazard, setting silver against black: I \\nwould not risk anything that is not my own. And already there is a bond of \\nlove between us.\\' \\n\\n\\'You choose well,\\' said Thjoden; \\'and I give him now gladly. Yet it is \\na great gift. There is none like to Shadowfax. In him one of the mighty \\nsteeds of old has returned. None such shall return again. And to you my \\nother guests I will offer such things as may be found in my armoury. Swords \\nyou do not need, but there are helms and coats of mail of cunning work, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngifts to my fathers out of Gondor. Choose from these ere we go, and may they \\nserve you well!\\' \\n\\nNow men came bearing raiment of war from the king\\'s hoard and they \\narrayed Aragorn and Legolas in shining mail. Helms too they chose, and round \\nshields: their bosses were overlaid with gold and set with gems, green and \\nred and white. Gandalf took no armour; and Gimli needed no coat of rings, \\neven if one had been found to match his stature, for there was no hauberk in \\nthe hoards of Edoras of better make than his short corslet forged beneath \\nthe Mountain in the North. But he chose a cap of iron and leather that \\nfitted well upon his round head; and a small shield he also took. It bore \\nthe running horse, white upon green, that was the emblem of the House of \\nEorl. \\n\\n\\'May it keep you well!\\' said Thjoden. \\'It was made for me in Thengel\\'s \\nday, while still I was a boy.\\' \\n\\nGimli bowed. \\'I am proud, Lord of the Mark, to bear your device,\\' he \\nsaid. \\'Indeed sooner would I bear a horse than be borne by one. I love my \\nfeet better. But, maybe, I shall come yet where I can stand and fight.\\' \\n\\n\\'It may well be so,\\' said Thjoden. \\n\\nThe king now rose, and at once Jowyn came forward bearing wine. \\'Ferthu \\nThjoden hbl!\\' she said. \\'Receive now this cup and drink in happy hour. \\nHealth be with thee at thy going and coming!\\' \\n\\nThjoden drank from the cup, and she then proffered it to the guests. As \\nshe stood before Aragorn she paused suddenly and looked upon him, and her \\neyes were shining. And he looked down upon her fair face and smiled; but as \\nhe took the cup, his hand met hers, and he knew that she trembled at the \\ntouch. \\'Hail Aragorn son of Arathorn!\\' she said. \\'Hail Lady of Rohan!\\' he \\nanswered, but his face now was troubled and he did not smile. \\n\\nWhen they had all drunk, the king went down the hall to the doors. \\n\\nThere the guards awaited him, and heralds stood, and all the lords and \\nchiefs were gathered together that remained in Edoras or dwelt nearby. \\n\\n\\'Behold! I go forth, and it seems like to be my last riding,\\' said \\nThjoden. \\'I have no child. Thjodred my son is slain. I name Jomer my \\nsister-son to be my heir. If neither of us return, then choose a new lord as \\nyou will. But to some one I must now entrust my people that I leave behind, \\nto rule them in my place. Which of you will stay?\\' \\n\\nNo man spoke. \\n\\n\\'Is there none whom you would name? In whom do my people trust?\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'In the House of Eorl,\\' answered Hbma. \\n\\n\\'But Jomer I cannot spare, nor would he stay,\\' said the king; \\'and he \\nis the last of that House.\\' \\n\\n\\'I said not Jomer,\\' answered Hbma. \\'And he is not the last. There is \\nJowyn, daughter of Jomund, his sister. She is fearless and high-hearted. All \\nlove her. Let her be as lord to the Eorlingas, while we are gone.\\' \\n\\n\\'It shall be so,\\' said Thjoden. \\'Let the heralds announce to the folk \\nthat the Lady Jowyn will lead them!\\' \\n\\nThen the king sat upon a seat before his doors, and Jowyn knelt before \\nhim and received from him a sword and a fair corslet. \\'Larewell \\nsister-daughter!\\' he said. \\'Dark is the hour, yet maybe we shall return to \\nthe Golden Hall. But in Dunharrow the people may long defend themselves, \\nand \\n\\nif the battle go ill, thither will come all who escape.\\' \\'Speak not so!\\' she \\nanswered. \\'A year shall I endure for every day that passes until your \\nreturn.\\' But as she spoke her eyes went to Aragorn who stood nearby. \\n\\n\\'The king shall come again,\\' he said. \\'Lear not! Not West but East does \\nour doom await us.\\' \\n\\nThe king now went down the stair with Gandalf beside him. The others \\nfollowed. Aragorn looked back as they passed towards the gate. Alone Jowyn \\nstood before the doors of the house at the stair\\'s head; the sword was set \\nupright before her, and her hands were laid upon the hilt. She was clad now \\nin mail and shone like silver in the sun. \\n\\nGimli walked with Legolas. his axe on his shoulder. \\'Well, at last we \\nset off!\\' he said. \\'Men need many words before deeds. My axe is restless in \\nmy hands. Though I doubt not that these Rohirrim are fell -handed when they \\ncome to it. Nonetheless this is not the warfare that suits me. How shall I \\ncome to the battle? I wish I could walk and not bump like a sack at \\nGandalf \\'s saddlebow.\\' \\n\\n\\'A safer seat than many, I guess,\\' said Legolas. \\'Yet doubtless Gandalf \\nwill gladly put you down on your feet when blows begin; or Shadowfax \\nhimself. An axe is no weapon for a rider.\\' \\n\\n\\'And a Dwarf is no horseman. It is ore-necks I would hew, not shave the \\nscalps of Men,\\' said Gimli, patting the haft of his axe. \\n\\nAt the gate they found a great host of men, old and young, all ready in \\nthe saddle. More than a thousand were there mustered. Their spears were like \\na springing wood. Loudly and joyously they shouted as Thjoden came forth. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSome held in readiness the king\\'s horse, Snowmane, and others held the \\nhorses of Aragorn and Legolas. Gimli stood ill at ease, frowning, but Jomer \\ncame up to him, leading his horse. \\n\\n\\'Hail, Gimli Gluin\\'s son!\\' he cried. \\'I have not had time to learn \\ngentle speech under your rod, as you promised. But shall we not put aside \\nour quarrel? At least I will speak no evil again of the Lady of the Wood.\\' \\n\\n\\'I will forget my wrath for a while, Jomer son of Jomund,\\' said Gimli; \\n\\n\\'but if ever you chance to see the Lady Galadriel with your eyes, then you \\nshall acknowledge her the fairest of ladies, or our friendship will end.\\' \\n\\n\\'So be it!\\' said Jomer. \\'But until that time pardon me, and in token of \\npardon ride with me, I beg. Gandalf will be at the head with the Lord of the \\nMark; but Firefoot, my horse, will bear us both, if you will.\\' \\n\\n\\'I thank you indeed,\\' said Gimli greatly pleased. \\'I will gladly go \\nwith you, if Legolas, my comrade, may ride beside us.\\' \\n\\n\\'It shall he so,\\' said Jomer. \\'Legolas upon my left, and Aragorn upon \\nmy right, and none will dare to stand before us!\\' \\n\\n\\'Where is Shadowfax?\\' said Gandalf. \\n\\n\\'Running wild over the grass,\\' they answered. \\'He will let no man \\nhandle him. There he goes, away down by the ford, like a shadow among the \\nwillows.\\' \\n\\nGandalf whistled and called aloud the horse\\'s name, and far away he \\ntossed his head and neighed, and turning sped towards the host like an \\narrow. \\n\\n\\'Were the breath of the West Wind to take a body visible, even so would \\nit appear,\\' said Jomer, as the great horse ran up, until he stood before the \\nwizard. \\n\\n\\'The gift seems already to be given,\\' said Thjoden. \\'But hearken all! \\n\\nHere now I name my guest, Gandalf Greyhame, wisest of counsellors; most \\nwelcome of wanderers, a lord of the Mark, a chieftain of the Eorlingas while \\nour kin shall last; and I give to him Shadowfax, prince of horses.\\' \\n\\n\\'I thank you, Thjoden King,\\' said Gandalf. Then suddenly he threw back \\nhis grey cloak, and cast aside his hat, and leaped to horseback. He wore no \\nhelm nor mail. His snowy hair flew free in the wind, his white robes shone \\ndazzling in the sun. \\n\\n\\'Behold the White Rider!\\' cried Aragorn, and all took up the words. \\n\\n\\'Our King and the White Rider!\\' they shouted. \\'Forth Eorlingas!\\' \\n\\nThe trumpets sounded. The horses reared and neighed. Spear clashed on \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nshield. Then the king raised his hand, and with a rush like the sudden onset \\nof a great wind the last host of Rohan rode thundering into the West. Far \\nover the plain Jowyn saw the glitter of their spears, as she stood still, \\nalone before the doors of the silent house. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 7. Helm\\'s Deep \\n\\n\\n\\nThe sun was already westering as they rode from Edoras, and the light \\nof it was in their eyes, turning all the rolling fields of Rohan to a golden \\nhaze. There was a beaten way, north-westward along the foot-hills of the \\nWhite Mountains, and this they followed, up and down in a green country, \\ncrossing small swift streams by many fords. Far ahead and to their right the \\nMisty Mountains loomed; ever darker and taller they grew as the miles went \\nby. The sun went slowly down before them. Evening came behind. \\n\\nThe host rode on. Need drove them. Fearing to come too late, they rode \\nwith all the speed they could, pausing seldom. Swift and enduring were the \\nsteeds of Rohan, but there were many leagues to go. Forty leagues and more \\nit was, as a bird flies, from Edoras to the fords of the Isen, where they \\nhoped to find the king\\'s men that held back the hosts of Saruman. \\n\\nNight closed about them. At last they halted to make their camp. They \\nhad ridden for some five hours and were far out upon the western plain, yet \\nmore than half their journey lay still before them. In a great circle, under \\nthe starry sky and the waxing moon, they now made their bivouac. They lit no \\nfires, for they were uncertain of events; but they set a ring of mounted \\nguards about them, and scouts rode out far ahead, passing like shadows in \\nthe folds of the land. The slow night passed without tidings or alarm. At \\ndawn the horns sounded, and within an hour they took the road again. \\n\\nThere were no clouds overhead yet, but a heaviness was in the air; it \\nwas hot for the season of the year. The rising sun was hazy, and behind it, \\nfollowing it slowly up the sky, there was a growing darkness, as of a great \\nstorm moving out of the East. And away in the North-west there seemed to be \\nanother darkness brooding about the feet of the Misty Mountains, a shadow \\nthat crept down slowly from the Wizard\\'s Vale. \\n\\nGandalf dropped back to where Legolas rode beside Jomer. \\'You have the \\nkeen eyes of your fair kindred, Legolas,\\' he said; \\'and they can tell a \\nsparrow from a finch a league off. Tell me, can you sec anything away yonder \\ntowards Isengard?\\' \\n\\n\\'Many miles lie between,\\' said Legolas, gazing thither and shading his \\neyes with his long hand. \\'I can see a darkness. There are shapes moving in \\nit, great shapes far away upon the bank of the river; but what they are I \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncannot tell. It is not mist or cloud that defeats my eyes: there is a \\nveiling shadow that some power lays upon the land, and it marches slowly \\ndown stream. It is as if the twilight under endless trees were flowing \\ndownwards from the hills.\\' \\n\\n\\'And behind us comes a very storm of Mordor,\\' said Gandalf. \\'It will be \\na black night.\\' \\n\\nAs the second day of their riding drew on, the heaviness in the air \\nincreased. In the afternoon the dark clouds began to overtake them: a sombre \\ncanopy with great billowing edges flecked with dazzling light. The sun went \\ndown, blood-red in a smoking haze. The spears of the Riders were tipped with \\nfire as the last shafts of light kindled the steep faces of the peaks of \\nThrihyrne: now very near they stood on the northernmost arm of the White \\nMountains, three jagged horns staring at the sunset. In the last red glow \\nmen in the vanguard saw a black speck, a horseman riding back towards them. \\nThey halted awaiting him. \\n\\nHe came, a weary man with dinted helm and cloven shield. Slowly he \\nclimbed from his horse and stood there a while gasping. At length he spoke. \\n\\n\\'Is Jomer here?\\' he asked. \\'You come at last, but too late, and with too \\nlittle strength. Things have gone evilly since Thjodred fell. We were driven \\nback yesterday over the Isen with great loss; many perished at the crossing. \\nThen at night fresh forces came over the river against our camp. All \\nIsengard must be emptied; and Saruman has armed the wild hillmen and \\nherd-folk of Dunland beyond the rivers, and these also he loosed upon us. We \\nwere overmastered. The shield- wall was broken. Erkenbrand of Westfold has \\ndrawn off those men he could gather towards his fastness in Helm\\'s Deep. The \\nrest are scattered. \\n\\n\\'Where is Jomer? Tell him there is no hope ahead. He should return to \\nEdoras before the wolves of Isengard come there.\\' Thjoden had sat silent, \\nhidden from the man\\'s sight behind his guards; now he urged his horse \\nforward. \\'Come, stand before me, Ceorl!\\' he said. \\'I am here. The last host \\nof the Eorlingas has ridden forth. It will not return without battle.\\' \\n\\nThe man\\'s face lightened with joy and wonder. He drew himself up. Then \\nhe knelt, offering his notched sword to the king. \\'Command me, lord!\\' he \\ncried. \\'And pardon me! I thought--\\' \\n\\n\\'You thought I remained in Meduseld bent like an old tree under winter \\nsnow. So it was when you rode to war. But a west wind has shaken the \\nboughs,\\' said Thjoden. \\'Give this man a fresh horse! Let us ride to the help \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nof Erkenbrand!\\' \\n\\nWhile Thjoden was speaking, Gandalf rode a short way ahead, and he sat \\nthere alone, gazing north to Isengard and west to the setting sun. Now he \\ncame back. \\n\\n\\'Ride, Thjoden!\\' he said. \\'Ride to Helm\\'s Deep! Go not to the Fords of \\nIsen, and do not tarry in the plain! I must leave you for a while. Shadowfax \\nmust bear me now on a swift errand.\\' Turning to Aragorn and Jomer and the \\nmen of the king\\'s household, he cried: \\'Keep well the Lord of the Mark, till \\nI return. Await me at Helm\\'s Gate! Farewell!\\' \\n\\nHe spoke a word to Shadowfax, and like an arrow from the bow the great \\nhorse sprang away. Even as they looked he was gone: a flash of silver in the \\nsunset, a wind over the grass, a shadow that fled and passed from sight. \\nSnowmane snorted and reared, eager to follow; but only a swift bird on the \\nwing could have overtaken him. \\n\\n\\'What does that mean?\\' said one of the guard to Hbma. \\n\\n\\'That Gandalf Greyhame has need of haste,\\' answered Hbma. \\'Ever he goes \\nand comes unlooked-for:\\' \\n\\n\\'Wormtongue, were he here, would not find it hard to explain \\'Said the \\nother. \\n\\n\\'True enough,\\' said Hbma; \\'but for myself, I will wait until I see \\nGandalf again.\\' \\n\\n\\'Maybe you will wait long,\\' said the other. \\n\\nThe host turned away now from the road to the Fords of Isen and bent \\ntheir course southward. Night fell, and still they rode on. The hills drew \\nnear, but the tall peaks of Thrihyrne were already dim against the darkening \\nsky. Still some miles away, on the far side of the Westfold Vale, lay a \\ngreen coomb, a great bay in the mountains, out of which a gorge opened in \\nthe hills. Men of that land called it Helm\\'s Deep, after a hero of old wars \\nwho had made his refuge there. Ever steeper and narrower it wound inward \\nfrom the north under the shadow of the Thrihyrne, till the crow-haunted \\ncliffs rose like mighty towers on either side, shutting out the light. \\n\\nAt Helm\\'s Gate, before the mouth of the Deep, there was a heel of rock \\nthrust outward by the northern cliff. There upon its spur stood high walls \\nof ancient stone, and within them was a lofty tower. Men said that in the \\nfar-off days of the glory of Gondor the sea-kings had built here this \\nfastness with the hands of giants. The Hornburg it was called, for a trumpet \\nsounded upon the tower echoed in the Deep behind, as if armies \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nlong -forgotten were issuing to war from caves beneath the hills. A wall, \\ntoo, the men of old had made from the Hornburg to the southern cliff, \\nbarring the entrance to the gorge. Beneath it by a wide culvert the \\nDeeping-stream passed out. About the feet of the Hornrock it wound, and \\nflowed then in a gully through the midst of a wide green gore, sloping \\ngently down from Helm\\'s Gate to Helm\\'s Dike. Thence it fell into the \\nDeeping-coomb and out into the Westfold Vale. There in the Hornburg at \\nHelm\\'s Gate Erkenbrand, master of Westfold on the borders of the Mark, now \\ndwelt. As the days darkened with threat of war, being wise, he had repaired \\nthe wall and made the fastness strong. \\n\\nThe Riders were still in the low valley before the mouth of the Coomb, \\nwhen cries and hornblasts were heard from their scouts that went in front. \\n\\nOut of the darkness arrows whistled. Swiftly a scout rode back and reported \\nthat wolf-riders were abroad in the valley, and that a host of Ores and wild \\nmen were hurrying southward from the Fords of Isen and seemed to be \\nmaking \\n\\nfor Helm\\'s Deep. \\n\\n\\'We have found many of our folk lying slain as they fled thither,\\' said \\nthe scout. \\'And we have met scattered companies, going this way and that, \\nleaderless. What has become of Erkenbrand none seem to know. It is likely \\nthat he will be overtaken ere he can reach Helm\\'s Gate, if he has not \\nalready perished.\\' \\n\\n\\'Has aught been seen of Gandalf?\\' asked Thjoden. \\n\\n\\'Yes, lord. Many have seen an old man in white upon a horse, passing \\nhither and thither over the plains like wind in the grass. Some thought he \\nwas Saruman. It is said that he went away ere nightfall towards Isengard. \\nSome say also that Wormtongue was seen earlier, going northward with a \\ncompany of Ores.\\' \\n\\n\\'It will go ill with Wormtongue, if Gandalf comes upon him said \\nThjoden. \\'Nonetheless I miss now both my counsellors, the old and the new. \\nBut in this need we have no better choice than to go on, as Gandalf said, to \\nHelm\\'s Gate, whether Erkenbrand be there or no. Is it known how great is the \\nhost that comes from the North?\\' \\n\\n\\'It is very great,\\' said the scout. \\'He that flies counts every foeman \\ntwice, yet I have spoken to stouthearted men, and I do not doubt that the \\nmain strength of the enemy is many times as great as all that we have here.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then let us be swift,\\' said Jomer. \\'Let us drive through such foes as \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nare already between us and the fastness. There are caves in Helm\\'s Deep \\nwhere hundreds may lie hid; and secret ways lead thence up on to the hills. \\n\\nTrust not to secret ways,\\' said the king. \\'Saruman has long spied out \\nthis land. Still in that place our defence may last long. Let us go!\\' \\n\\nAragorn and Legolas went now with Jomer in the van. On through the dark \\nnight they rode, ever slower as the darkness deepened and their way climbed \\nsouthward, higher and higher into the dim folds about the mountains\\' feet. \\nThey found few of the enemy before them. Here and there they came upon \\nroving bands of Ores; but they fled ere the Riders could take or slay them. \\n\\n\\'It will not be long I fear,\\' said Jomer, \\'ere the coming of the king\\'s \\nhost will be known to the leader of our enemies, Saruman or whatever captain \\nhe has sent forth.\\' \\n\\nThe rumour of war grew behind them. Now they could hear, borne over the \\ndark, the sound of harsh singing. They had climbed far up into the \\nDeeping-coomb when they looked back. Then they saw torches countless \\npoints \\n\\nof fiery light upon the black fields behind, scattered like red flowers, or \\nwinding up from the lowlands in long flickering lines. Here and there a \\nlarger blaze leapt up. \\n\\n\\'It is a great host and follows us hard,\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\n\\'They bring fire,\\' said Thjoden, \\'and they are burning as they come, \\nrick, cot, and tree. This was a rich vale and had many homesteads. Alas for \\nmy folk!\\' \\n\\n\\'Would that day was here and we might ride down upon them like a storm \\nout of the mountains!\\' said Aragorn. \\'It grieves me to fly before them.\\' \\n\\n\\'We need not fly much further,\\' said Jomer. \\'Not far ahead now lies \\nHelm\\'s Dike, an ancient trench and rampart scored across the coomb, two \\nfurlongs below Helm\\'s Gate. There we can turn and give battle.\\' \\n\\n\\'Nay, we are too few to defend the Dike,\\' said Thjoden. \\'It is a mile \\nlong or more, and the breach in it is wide.\\' \\n\\n\\'At the breach our rearguard must stand, if we are pressed,\\' said \\nJomer. \\n\\nThere was neither star nor moon when the Riders came to the breach in \\nthe Dike, where the stream from above passed out, and the road beside it ran \\ndown from the Hornburg. The rampart loomed suddenly before them, a high \\nshadow beyond a dark pit. As they rode up a sentinel challenged them. \\n\\n\\'The Lord of the Mark rides to Helm\\'s Gate,\\' Jomer answered. \\'I, Jomer \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nson of Jomund, speak.\\' \\n\\nThis is good tidings beyond hope,\\' said the sentinel. \\'Hasten! The \\nenemy is on your heels.\\' \\n\\nThe host passed through the breach and halted on the sloping sward \\nabove. They now learned to their joy that Erkenbrand had left many men to \\nhold Helm\\'s Gate, and more had since escaped thither. \\n\\n\\'Maybe, we have a thousand fit to fight on foot,\\' said Gamling, an old \\nman, the leader of those that watched the Dike. \\'But most of them have seen \\ntoo many winters, as I have, or too few, as my son\\'s son here. What news of \\nErkenbrand? Word came yesterday that he was retreating hither with all that \\nis left of the best Riders of Westfold. But he has not come.\\' \\n\\n\\'I fear that he will not come now,\\' said Jomer. \\'Our scouts have gained \\nno news of him, and the enemy fills all the valley behind us.\\' \\n\\n\\'I would that he had escaped,\\' said Thjoden. \\'He was a mighty man. In \\nhim lived again the valour of Helm the Hammerhand. But we cannot await \\nhim \\n\\nhere. We must draw all our forces now behind the walls. Are you well stored? \\nWe bring little provision, for we rode forth to open battle, not to a \\nsiege.\\' \\n\\n\\'Behind us in the caves of the Deep are three parts of the folk of \\nWestfold, old and young, children and women,\\' said Gamling. \\'But great store \\nof food, and many beasts and their fodder, have also been gathered there.\\' \\n\\n\\'That is well,\\' said Jomer. \\'They are burning or despoiling all that is \\nleft in the vale.\\' \\n\\n\\'If they come to bargain for our goods at Helm\\'s Gate, they will pay a \\nhigh price,\\' said Gamling. \\n\\nThe king and his Riders passed on. Before the causeway that crossed the \\nstream they dismounted. In a long file they led their horses up the ramp and \\npassed within the gates of the Hornburg. There they were welcomed again with \\njoy and renewed hope; for now there were men enough to man both the burg \\nand \\n\\nthe barrier wall. \\n\\nQuickly Jomer set his men in readiness. The king and the men of his \\nhousehold were in the Hornburg, and there also were many of the \\nWestfold-men. But on the Deeping Wall and its tower, and behind it, Jomer \\narrayed most of the strength that he had, for here the defence seemed more \\ndoubtful, if the assault were determined and in great force. The horses were \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nled far up the Deep under such guard as could be spared. \\n\\nThe Deeping Wall was twenty feet high, and so thick that four men could \\nwalk abreast along the top, sheltered by a parapet over which only a tall \\nman could look. Here and there were clefts in the stone through which men \\ncould shoot. This battlement could be reached by a stair running down from a \\ndoor in the outer court of the Hornburg; three flights of steps led also up \\non to the wall from the Deep behind; but in front it was smooth, and the \\ngreat stones of it were set with such skill that no foothold could be found \\nat their joints, and at the top they hung over like a sea-delved cliff. \\n\\nGimli stood leaning against the breastwork upon the wall. Legolas sat \\nabove on the parapet, fingering his bow, and peering out into the gloom. \\n\\nThis is more to my liking,\\' said the dwarf, stamping on the stones. \\n\\n\\'Ever my heart rises as we draw near the mountains. There is good rock here. \\nThis country has tough bones. I felt them in my feet as we came up from the \\ndike. Give me a year and a hundred of my kin and I would make this a place \\nthat armies would break upon like water.\\' \\n\\n\\'I do not doubt it,\\' said Legolas. \\'But you are a dwarf, and dwarves \\nare strange folk. I do not like this place, and I shall like it no more by \\nthe light of day. But you comfort me, Gimli, and I am glad to have you \\nstanding nigh with your stout legs and your hard axe. I wish there were more \\nof your kin among us. But even more would I give for a hundred good archers \\nof Mirkwood. We shall need them. The Rohirrim have good bowmen after \\ntheir \\n\\nfashion, but there are too few here, too few.\\' \\n\\n\\'It is dark for archery,\\' said Gimli. \\'Indeed it is time for sleep. \\n\\nSleep! I feel the need of it, as never I thought any dwarf could. Riding is \\ntiring work. Yet my axe is restless in my hand. Give me a row of ore-necks \\nand room to swing and all weariness will fall from me!\\' \\n\\nA slow time passed. Far down in the valley scattered fires still \\nburned. The hosts of Isengard were advancing in silence now. Their torches \\ncould be seen winding up the coomb in many lines. \\n\\nSuddenly from the Dike yells and screams, and the fierce battle-cries \\nof men broke out. Flaming brands appeared over the brink and clustered \\nthickly at the breach. Then they scattered and vanished. Men came galloping \\nback over the field and up the ramp to the gate of the Hornburg. The \\nrearguard of the Westfolders had been driven in. \\n\\n\\'The enemy is at hand!\\' they said. \\'We loosed every arrow that we had, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand filled the Dike with Ores. But it will not halt them long. Already they \\nare scaling the bank at many points, thick as marching ants. But we have \\ntaught them not to carry torches.\\' \\n\\nIt was now past midnight. The sky was utterly dark, and the stillness \\nof the heavy air foreboded storm. Suddenly the clouds were seared by a \\nblinding flash. Branched lightning smote down upon the eastward hills. For a \\nstaring moment the watchers on the walls saw all the space between them and \\nthe Dike lit with white light: it was boiling and crawling with black \\nshapes, some squat and broad, some tall and grim, with high helms and sable \\nshields. Hundreds and hundreds more were pouring over the Dike and through \\nthe breach. The dark tide flowed up to the walls from cliff to cliff. \\n\\nThunder rolled in the valley. Rain came lashing down. \\n\\nArrows thick as the rain came whistling over the battlements, and fell \\nclinking and glancing on the stones. Some found a mark. The assault on \\nHelm\\'s Deep had begun, but no sound or challenge was heard within; no \\nanswering arrows came. \\n\\nThe assailing hosts halted, foiled by the silent menace of rock and \\nwall. Ever and again the lightning tore aside the darkness. Then the Ores \\nscreamed, waving spear and sword, and shooting a cloud of arrows at any that \\nstood revealed upon the battlements; and the men of the Mark amazed looked \\nout, as it seemed to them, upon a great field of dark corn, tossed by a \\ntempest of war, and every ear glinted with barbed light. \\n\\nBrazen trumpets sounded. The enemy surged forward, some against the \\nDeeping Wall, other towards the causeway and the ramp that led up to the \\nHornburg-gates. There the hugest Ores were mustered, and the wild men of the \\nDunland fells. A moment they hesitated and then on they came. The lightning \\nflashed, and blazoned upon every helm and shield the ghastly hand of \\nIsengard was seen: They reached the summit of the rock; they drove towards \\nthe gates. \\n\\nThen at last an answer came: a storm of arrows met them, and a hail of \\nstones. They wavered, broke, and fled back; and then charged again, broke \\nand charged again; and each time, like the incoming sea, they halted at a \\nhigher point. Again trumpets rang, and a press of roaring men leaped forth. \\nThey held their great shields above them like a roof, while in their midst \\nthey bore two trunks of mighty trees. Behind them ore-archers crowded, \\nsending a hail of darts against the bowmen on the walls. They gained the \\ngates. The trees, swung by strong arms, smote the timbers with a rending \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nboom. If any man fell, crushed by a stone hurtling from above, two others \\nsprang to take his place. Again and again the great rams swung and crashed. \\n\\nJomer and Aragorn stood together on the Deeping Wall. They heard the \\nroar of voices and the thudding of the rams; and then in a sudden flash of \\nlight they beheld the peril of the gates. \\n\\n\\'Come!\\' said Aragorn. \\'This is the hour when we draw swords together!\\' \\n\\nRunning like fire, they sped along the wall, and up the steps, and \\npassed into the outer court upon the Rock. As they ran they gathered a \\nhandful of stout swordsmen. There was a small postern-door that opened in an \\nangle of the burg- wall on the west, where the cliff stretched out to meet \\nit. On that side a narrow path ran round towards the great gate, between the \\nwall and the sheer brink of the Rock. Together Jomer and Aragorn sprang \\nthrough the door, their men close behind. The swords flashed from the sheath \\nas one. \\n\\n\\'G(r)thwinl!\\' cried Jomer. \\'G(r)thwinl for the Mark!\\' \\n\\n\\'And(r)ril!\\' cried Aragorn. \\'And(r)ril for the D(r)nedain!\\' \\n\\nCharging from the side, they hurled themselves upon the wild men. \\nAnd(r)ril rose and fell, gleaming with white fire. A shout went up from wall \\nand tower: \\'And(r)ril! And(r)ril goes to war. The Blade that was Broken shines \\nagain!\\' \\n\\nDismayed the rammers let fall the trees and turned to fight; but the \\nwall of their shields was broken as by a lightning-stroke, and they were \\nswept away, hewn down, or cast over the Rock into the stony stream below. \\nThe ore-archers shot wildly and then fled. \\n\\nFor a moment Jomer and Aragorn halted before the gates. The thunder was \\nrumbling in the distance now. The lightning flickered still, far off among \\nthe mountains in the South. A keen wind was blowing from the North again. \\nThe clouds were torn and drifting, and stars peeped out; and above the hills \\nof the Coomb-side the westering moon rode, glimmering yellow in the \\nstorm-wrack. \\n\\n\\'We did not come too soon,\\' said Aragorn, looking at the gates. Their \\ngreat hinges and iron bars were wrenched and bent; many of their timbers \\nwere cracked. \\n\\n\\'Yet we cannot stay here beyond the walls to defend them,\\' said Jomer. \\n\\'Look!\\' He pointed to the causeway. Already a great press of Ores and Men \\nwere gathering again beyond the stream. Arrows whined, and skipped on the \\nstones about them. \\'Come! We must get back and see what we can do to pile \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstone and beam across the gates within. Come now!\\' \\n\\nThey turned and ran. At that moment some dozen Ores that had lain \\nmotionless among the slain leaped to their feet, and came silently and \\nswiftly behind. Two flung themselves to the ground at Jomer\\'s heels, tripped \\nhim, and in a moment they were on top of him. But a small dark figure that \\nnone had observed sprang out of the shadows and gave a hoarse shout: Baruk \\nKhazvd! Khazvd ai-mknu! An axe swung and swept back. Two Ores fell \\nheadless. \\n\\nThe rest fled. \\n\\nJomer struggled to his feet, even as Aragorn ran back to his aid. \\n\\nThe postern was closed again, the iron door was barred and piled inside \\nwith stones. When all were safe within, Jomer turned: \\'I thank you, Gimli \\nson of Gluin!\\' he said. \\'I did not know that you were with us in the sortie. \\n\\nBut oft the unbidden guest proves the best company. How came you there?\\' \\n\\n\\'I followed you to shake off sleep,\\' said Gimli; \\'but I looked on the \\nhillmen and they seemed over large for me, so I sat beside a stone to see \\nyour sword-play.\\' \\n\\n\\'I shall not find it easy to repay you,\\' said Jomer. \\n\\n\\'There may be many a chance ere the night is over,\\' laughed the Dwarf. \\n\\n\\'But I am content. Till now I have hewn naught but wood since I left Moria.\\' \\n\\n\\'Two!\\' said Gimli, patting his axe. He had returned to his place on the \\nwall. \\n\\n\\'Two?\\' said Legolas. \\'I have done better, though now I must grope for \\nspent arrows; all mine are gone. Yet I make my tale twenty at the least. But \\nthat is only a few leaves in a forest.\\' \\n\\nThe sky now was quickly clearing and the sinking moon was shining \\nbrightly. But the light brought little hope to the Riders of the Mark. The \\nenemy before them seemed to have grown rather than diminished, still more \\nwere pressing up from the valley through the breach. The sortie upon the \\nRock gained only a brief respite. The assault on the gates was redoubled. \\nAgainst the Deeping Wall the hosts of Isengard roared like a sea. Ores and \\nhillmen swarmed about its feet from end to end. Ropes with grappling hooks \\nwere hurled over the parapet faster than men could cut them or fling them \\nback. Hundreds of long ladders were lifted up. Many were cast down in ruin, \\nbut many more replaced them, and Ores sprang up them like apes in the dark \\nforests of the South. Before the wall\\'s foot the dead and broken were piled \\nlike shingle in a storm; ever higher rose the hideous mounds, and still the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nenemy came on. \\n\\nThe men of Rohan grew weary. All their arrows were spent, and every \\nshaft was shot; their swords were notched, and their shields were riven. \\nThree times Aragorn and Jomer rallied them, and three times And(r)ril flamed \\nin a desperate charge that drove the enemy from the wall. \\n\\nThen a clamour arose in the Deep behind. Ores had crept like rats \\nthrough the culvert through which the stream flowed out. There they had \\ngathered in the shadow of the cliffs, until the assault above was hottest \\nand nearly all the men of the defence had rushed to the wall\\'s top. Then \\nthey sprang out. Already some had passed into the jaws of the Deep and were \\namong the horses, fighting with the guards. \\n\\nDown from the wall leapt Gimli with a fierce cry that echoed in the \\ncliffs. \\'Khazvd! Khazvd!\\' He soon had work enough. \\n\\n\\'Ai-oi!\\' he shouted. \\'The Ores are behind the wall. Ai-oi! Come, \\nLegolas! There are enough for us both. Khazvd ai-mknu!\\' \\n\\nGamling the Old looked down from the Hornburg, hearing the great voice \\nof the dwarf above all the tumult. \\'The Ores are in the Deep!\\' he cried. \\n\\'Helm! Helm! Forth Helmingas. he shouted as he leaped down the stair from \\nthe Rock with many men of Westfold at his back. \\n\\nTheir onset was fierce and sudden, and the Ores gave way before them. \\nEre long they were hemmed in in the narrows of the gorge, and all were slain \\nor driven shrieking into the chasm of the Deep to fall before the guardians \\nof the hidden caves. \\n\\n\\'Twenty -one!\\' cried Gimli. He hewed a two-handed stroke and laid the \\nlast Ore before his feet. \\'Now my count passes Master Legolas again.\\' \\n\\n\\'We must stop this rat-hole,\\' said Gamling. \\'Dwarves are said to be \\ncunning folk with stone. Lend us your aid, master!\\' \\n\\n\\'We do not shape stone with battle-axes, nor with our finger-nails,\\' \\nsaid Gimli. \\'But I will help as I may.\\' \\n\\nThey gathered such small boulders and broken stones as they could find \\nto hand, and under Gimli\\'s direction the Westfold-men blocked up the inner \\nend of the culvert, until only a narrow outlet remained. Then the \\nDeeping-stream, swollen by the rain, churned and fretted in its choked path, \\nand spread slowly in cold pools from cliff to cliff. \\n\\n\\'It will be drier above,\\' said Gimli. \\'Come, Gamling, let us see how \\nthings go on the wall!\\' \\n\\nHe climbed up and found Legolas beside Aragorn and Jomer. The elf was \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhetting his long knife. There was for a while a lull in the assault, since \\nthe attempt to break in through the culvert had been foiled. \\n\\n\\'Twenty-one!\\' said Gimli. \\n\\n\\'Good!\\' said Legolas. \\'But my count is now two dozen. It has been \\nknife- work up here.\\' \\n\\nJomer and Aragorn leant wearily on their swords. Away on the left the \\ncrash and clamour of the battle on the Rock rose loud again. But the \\nHornburg still held fast, like an island in the sea. Its gates lay in ruin; \\nbut over the barricade of beams and stones within no enemy as yet had \\npassed. \\n\\nAragorn looked at the pale stars, and at the moon, now sloping behind \\nthe western hills that enclosed the valley. \\'This is a night as long as \\nyears,\\' he said. \\'How long will the day tarry?\\' \\n\\n\\'Dawn is not far off,\\' said Gamling, who had now climbed up beside him. \\n\\'But dawn will not help us, I fear.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yet dawn is ever the hope of men,\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\n\\'But these creatures of Isengard, these half-ores and goblin-men that \\nthe foul craft of Saruman has bred, they will not quail at the sun,\\' said \\nGamling. \\'And neither will the wild men of the hills. Do you not hear their \\nvoices?\\' \\n\\n\\'I hear them,\\' said Jomer; \\'but they are only the scream of birds and \\nthe bellowing of beasts to my ears.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yet there are many that cry in the Dunland tongue,\\' said Gamling. \\'I \\nknow that tongue. It is an ancient speech of men, and once was spoken in \\nmany western valleys of the Mark. Hark! They hate us, and they are glad; for \\nour doom seems certain to them. \\'The king the king!\\' they cry. \\'We will take \\ntheir king. Death to the Forgoil! Death to the Strawheads ! Death to the \\nrobbers of the North!\\' Such names they have for us. Not in half a thousand \\nyears have they forgotten their grievance that the lords of Gondor gave the \\nMark to Eorl the Young and made alliance with him. That old hatred Saruman \\nhas inflamed. They are fierce folk when roused. They will not give way now \\nfor dusk or dawn, until Thjoden is taken, or they themselves are slain.\\' \\n\\n\\'Nonetheless day will bring hope to me,\\' said Aragorn. \\'Is it not said \\nthat no foe has ever taken the Hornburg, if men defended it?\\' \\n\\n\\'So the minstrels say,\\' said Jomer. \\n\\n\\'Then let us defend it, and hope!\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\nEven as they spoke there came a blare of trumpets. Then there was a \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncrash and a flash of flame and smoke. The waters of the Deeping-stream \\npoured out hissing and foaming: they were choked no longer, a gaping hole \\nwas blasted in the wall. A host of dark shapes poured in. \\n\\n\\'Devilry of Saruman!\\' cried Aragorn. \\'They have crept in the culvert \\nagain, while we talked, and they have lit the fire of Orthanc beneath our \\nfeet. Elendil, Elendil!\\' he shouted, as he leaped down into the breach; but \\neven as he did so a hundred ladders were raised against the battlements. \\nOver the wall and under the wall the last assault came sweeping like a dark \\nwave upon a hill of sand. The defence was swept away. Some of the Riders \\nwere driven back, further and further into the Deep, falling and fighting as \\nthey gave way, step by step, towards the caves. Others cut their way back \\ntowards the citadel. \\n\\nA broad stairway, climbed from the Deep up to the Rock and the \\nrear-gate of the Hornburg. Near the bottom stood Aragorn. In his hand still \\nAnd(r)ril gleamed, and the terror of the sword for a while held back the \\nenemy, as one by one all who could gain the stair passed up towards the \\ngate. Behind on the upper steps knelt Legolas. His bow was bent, but one \\ngleaned arrow was all that he had left, and he peered out now, ready to \\nshoot the first Ore that should dare to approach the stair. \\n\\n\\'All who can have now got safe within, Aragorn,\\' he called. \\'Come \\nback!\\' \\n\\nAragorn turned and sped up the stair; but as he ran he stumbled in his \\nweariness. At once his enemies leapt forward. Up came the Ores, yelling, \\nwith their long arms stretched out to seize him. The foremost fell with \\nLegolas\\' last arrow in his throat, but the rest sprang over him. Then a \\ngreat boulder, cast from the outer wall above, crashed down upon the stair, \\nand hurled them back into the Deep. Aragorn gained the door, and swiftly it \\nclanged to behind him. \\n\\n\\'Things go ill, my friends,\\' he said, wiping the sweat from his brow \\nwith his arm. \\n\\n\\'Ill enough,\\' said Legolas, \\'but not yet hopeless, while we have you \\nwith us. Where is Gimli?\\' \\n\\n\\'I do not know.\\' said Aragorn. \\'I last saw him fighting on the ground \\nbehind the wall, but the enemy swept us apart.\\' \\n\\n\\'Alas! That is evil news,\\' said Legolas. \\n\\n\\'He is stout and strong,\\' said Aragorn. \\'Let us hope that he will \\nescape back to the caves. There he would be safe for a while. Safer than we. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSuch a refuge would be to the liking of a dwarf.\\' \\n\\nThat must be my hope\" said Legolas. \\'But I wish that he had come this \\nway. I desired to tell Master Gimli that my tale is now thirty-nine.\\' \\n\\n\\'If he wins back to the caves, he will pass your count again,\\' laughed \\nAragorn. \\'Never did I see an axe so wielded.\\' \\n\\n\\'I must go and seek some arrows,\\' said Legolas. \\'Would that this night \\nwould end, and I could have better light for shooting.\\' \\n\\nAragorn now passed into the citadel. There to his dismay he learned \\nthat Jomer had not reached the Hornburg. \\n\\n\\'Nay, he did not come to the Rock,\\' said one of the Westfold-men, \\'I \\nlast saw him gathering men about him and fighting in the mouth of the Deep. \\nGamling was with him, and the dwarf; but I could not come to them.\\' \\n\\nAragorn strode on through the inner court, and mounted to a high \\nchamber in the tower. There stood the king, dark against a narrow window, \\nlooking out upon the vale. \\n\\n\\'What is the news, Aragorn?\\' he said. \\n\\n\\'The Deeping Wall is taken, lord, and all the defence swept away; but \\nmany have escaped hither to the Rock.\\' \\n\\n\\'Is Jomer here?\\' \\n\\n\\'No, lord. But many of your men retreated into the Deep; and some say \\nthat Jomer was amongst them. In the narrows they may hold back the enemy \\nand \\n\\ncome within the caves. What hope they may have then I do not know.\\' \\n\\n\\'More than we. Good provision, it is said. And the air is wholesome \\nthere because of the outlets through fissures in the rock far above. None \\ncan force an entrance against determined men. They may hold out long.\\' \\n\\n\\'But the Ores have brought a devilry from Orthanc,\\' said Aragorn. \\'They \\nhave a blasting fire, and with it they took the Wall. If they cannot come in \\nthe caves, they may seal up those that are inside. But now we must turn all \\nour thoughts to our own defence.\\' \\n\\n\\'I fret in this prison,\\' said Thjoden. \\'If I could have set a spear in \\nrest, riding before my men upon the field, maybe I could have felt again the \\njoy of battle, and so ended. But I serve little purpose here.\\' \\n\\n\\'Here at least you are guarded in the strongest fastness of the Mark,\\' \\nsaid Aragorn. \\'More hope we have to defend you in the Hornburg than in \\nEdoras, or even at Dunharrow in the mountains.\\' \\n\\n\\'It is said that the Hornburg has never fallen to assault,\\' said \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThjoden; \\'but now my heart is doubtful. The world changes, and all that once \\nwas strong now proves unsure. How shall any tower withstand such numbers \\nand \\n\\nsuch reckless hate? Had I known that the strength of Isengard was grown so \\ngreat, maybe 1 should not so rashly have ridden forth to meet it, for all \\nthe arts of Gandalf. His counsel seems not now so good as it did under the \\nmorning sun.\\' \\n\\n\\'Do not judge the counsel of Gandalf, until all is over, lord,\\' said \\nAragorn. \\n\\n\\'The end will not be long,\\' said the king. \\'But I will not end here, \\ntaken like an old badger in a trap. Snowmane and Hasufel and the horses of \\nmy guard are in the inner court. When dawn comes, I will bid men sound \\nHelm\\'s horn, and I will ride forth. Will you ride with me then, son of \\nArathorn? Maybe we shall cleave a road, or make such an end as will be worth \\na song-if any be left to sing of us hereafter.\\' \\n\\n\\'I will ride with you,\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\nTaking his leave, he returned to the walls, and passed round all their \\ncircuit, enheartening the men, and lending aid wherever the assault was hot. \\nLegolas went with him. Blasts of fire leaped up from below shaking the \\nstones. Grappling -hooks were hurled, and ladders raised. Again and again the \\nOres gained the summit of the outer wall, and again the defenders cast them \\ndown. \\n\\nAt last Aragorn stood above the great gates, heedless of the darts of \\nthe enemy. As he looked forth he saw the eastern sky grow pale. Then he \\nraised his empty hand, palm outward in token of parley. \\n\\nThe Ores yelled and jeered. \\'Come down! Come down!\\' they cried. \\'If you \\nwish to speak to us, come down! Bring out your king! We are the fighting \\nUruk-hai. We will fetch him from his hole, if he does not come. Bring out \\nyour skulking king!\\' \\n\\n\\'The king stays or comes at his own will,\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\n\\'Then what are you doing here?\\' they answered. \\'Why do you look out? Do \\nyou wish to see the greatness of our army? We are the fighting Uruk-hai.\\' \\n\\n\\'I looked out to see the dawn,\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\n\\'What of the dawn?\\' they jeered. \\'We are the Uruk-hai: we do not stop \\nthe fight for night or day, for fair weather or for storm. We come to kill, \\nby sun or moon. What of the dawn?\\' \\n\\n\\'None knows what the new day shall bring him,\\' said Aragorn. \\'Get you \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngone, ere it turn to your evil.\\' \\n\\n\\'Get down or we will shoot you from the wall,\\' they cried. \\'This is no \\nparley. You have nothing to say.\\' \\n\\n\\'I have still this to say,\\' answered Aragorn. \\'No enemy has yet taken \\nthe Hornburg. Depart, or not one of you will be spared. Not one will be left \\nalive to take back tidings to the North. You do not know your peril.\\' \\n\\nSo great a power and royalty was revealed in Aragorn, as he stood there \\nalone above the ruined gates before the host of his enemies, that many of \\nthe wild men paused, and looked back over their shoulders to the valley, and \\nsome looked up doubtfully at the sky. But the Ores laughed with loud voices; \\nand a hail of darts and arrows whistled over the wall, as Aragorn leaped \\ndown. \\n\\nThere was a roar and a blast of fire. The archway of the gate above \\nwhich he had stood a moment before crumbled and crashed in smoke and \\ndust. \\n\\nThe barricade was scattered as if by a thunderbolt. Aragorn ran to the \\nking\\'s tower. \\n\\nBut even as the gate fell, and the Ores about it yelled, preparing to \\ncharge, a murmur arose behind them, like a wind in the distance, and it grew \\nto a clamour of many voices crying strange news in the dawn. The Ores upon \\nthe Rock, hearing the rumour of dismay, wavered and looked back. And then, \\nsudden and terrible, from the tower above, the sound of the great horn of \\nHelm rang out. \\n\\nAll that heard that sound trembled. Many of the Ores cast themselves on \\ntheir faces and covered their ears with their claws. Back from the Deep the \\nechoes came, blast upon blast, as if on every cliff and hill a mighty herald \\nstood. But on the walls men looked up, listening with wonder; for the echoes \\ndid not die. Ever the horn-blasts wound on among the hills; nearer now and \\nlouder they answered one to another, blowing fierce and free. \\n\\n\\'Helm! Helm!\\' the Riders shouted. \\'Helm is arisen and comes back to \\nwar. Helm for Thjoden King!\\' \\n\\nAnd with that shout the king came. His horse was white as snow, golden \\nwas his shield, and his spear was long. At his right hand was Aragorn, \\nElendil\\'s heir, behind him rode the lords of the House of Eorl the Young. \\nLight sprang in the sky. Night departed. \\n\\n\\'Forth Eorlingas!\\' With a cry and a great noise they charged. Down from \\nthe gates they roared, over the causeway they swept, and they drove through \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe hosts of Isengard as a wind among grass. Behind them from the Deep came \\nthe stern cries of men issuing from the caves, driving forth the enemy. Out \\npoured all the men that were left upon the Rock. And ever the sound of \\nblowing horns echoed in the hills. \\n\\nOn they rode, the king and his companions. Captains and champions fell \\nor fled before them. Neither ore nor man withstood them. Their backs were to \\nthe swords and spears of the Riders and their faces to the valley. They \\ncried and wailed, for fear and great wonder had come upon them with the \\nrising of the day. \\n\\nSo King Thjoden rode from Helm\\'s Gate and clove his path to the great \\nDike. There the company halted. Light grew bright about them. Shafts of the \\nsun flared above the eastern hills and glimmered on their spears. But they \\nsat silent on their horses, and they gazed down upon the Deeping-coomb. \\n\\nThe land had changed. Where before the green dale had lain, its grassy \\nslopes lapping the ever-mounting hills, there now a forest loomed. Great \\ntrees, bare and silent, stood, rank on rank, with tangled bough and hoary \\nhead; their twisted roots were buried in the long green grass. Darkness was \\nunder them. Between the Dike and the eaves of that nameless wood only two \\nopen furlongs lay. There now cowered the proud hosts of Saruman, in terror \\nof the king and in terror of the trees. They streamed down from Helm\\'s Gate \\nuntil all above the Dike was empty of them, but below it they were packed \\nlike swarming flies. Vainly they crawled and clambered about the walls of \\nthe coomb, seeking to escape. Upon the east too sheer and stony was the \\nvalley\\'s side; upon the left, from the west, their final doom approached. \\n\\nThere suddenly upon a ridge appeared a rider, clad in white, shining in \\nthe rising sun. Over the low hills the horns were sounding. Behind him, \\nhastening down the long slopes, were a thousand men on foot; their swords \\nwere in their hands. Amid them strode a man tall and strong. His shield was \\nred. As he came to the valley\\'s brink, he set to his lips a great black horn \\nand blew a ringing blast. \\n\\n\\'Erkenbrand!\\' the Riders shouted. \\'Erkenbrand!\\' \\n\\n\\'Behold the White Rider!\\' cried Aragorn. \\'Gandalf is come again!\\' \\n\\n\\'Mithrandir, Mithrandir!\\' said Legolas. \\'This is wizardry indeed! Come! \\n\\nI would look on this forest, ere the spell changes.\\' \\n\\nThe hosts of Isengard roared, swaying this way and that, turning from \\nfear to fear. Again the horn sounded from the tower. Down through the breach \\nof the Dike charged the king\\'s company. Down from the hills leaped \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nErkenbrand, lord of Westfold. Down leaped Shadowfax, like a deer that runs \\nsurefooted in the mountains. The White Rider was upon them, and the terror \\nof his coming filled the enemy with madness. The wild men fell on their \\nfaces before him. The Ores reeled and screamed and cast aside both sword and \\nspear. Like a black smoke driven by a mounting wind they fled. Wailing they \\npassed under the waiting shadow of the trees; and from that shadow none ever \\ncame again. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 8 . The Road to Isengard \\n\\n\\n\\nSo it was that in the light of a fair morning King Thjoden and Gandalf \\nthe White Rider met again upon the green grass beside the Deeping -stream. \\nThere was also Aragorn son of Arathorn, and Legolas the Elf, and Erkenbrand \\nof Westfold, and the lords of the Golden Elouse. About them were gathered the \\nRohirrim, the Riders of the Mark: wonder overcame their joy in victory, and \\ntheir eyes were turned towards the wood. \\n\\nSuddenly there was a great shout, and down from the Dike came those who \\nhad been driven back into the Deep. There came Gamling the Old, and Jomer \\nson of Jomund, and beside them walked Gimli the dwarf. Ele had no helm, \\nand \\n\\nabout his head was a linen band stained with blood; but his voice was loud \\nand strong. \\n\\n\\'Forty -two, Master Legolas!\\' he cried. \\'Alas! My axe is notched: the \\nforty-second had an iron collar on his neck. How is it with you?\\' \\n\\n\\'You have passed my score by one,\\' answered Legolas. \\'But I do not \\ngrudge you the game, so glad am I to see you on your legs!\\' \\n\\n\\'Welcome, Jomer, sister-son!\\' said Thjoden. \\'Now that I see you safe, I \\nam glad indeed.\\' \\n\\n\\'Hail, Lord of the Mark!\\' said Jomer. \\'The dark night has passed and \\nday has come again. But the day has brought strange tidings.\\' He turned and \\ngazed in wonder, first at the wood and then at Gandalf. \\'Once more you come \\nin the hour of need, unlooked-for,\\' he said. \\n\\n\\'Unlooked-for?\\' said Gandalf. \\'I said that I would return and meet you \\nhere.\\' \\n\\n\\'But you did not name the hour, nor foretell the manner of your coming. \\nStrange help you bring. You are mighty in wizardry, Gandalf the White!\\' \\n\\n\\'That may be. But if so, I have not shown it yet. I have but given good \\ncounsel in peril, and made use of the speed of Shadowfax. Your own valour \\nhas done more, and the stout legs of the Westfold-men marching through the \\nnight.\\' \\n\\nThen they all gazed at Gandalf with still greater wonder. Some glanced \\ndarkly at the wood, and passed their hands over their brows, as if they \\nthought their eyes saw otherwise than his. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGandalf laughed long and merrily. The trees?\\' he said. \\'Nay, I see the \\nwood as plainly as do you. But that is no deed of mine. It is a thing beyond \\nthe counsel of the wise. Better than my design, and better even than my hope \\nthe event has proved.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then if not yours, whose is the wizardry?\\' said Thjoden. \\'Not \\nSaruman\\'s, that is plain. Is there some mightier sage, of whom we have yet \\nto learn?\\' \\n\\n\\'It is not wizardry, but a power far older,\\' said Gandalf: \\'a power \\nthat walked the earth, ere elf sang or hammer rang. \\n\\nEre iron was found or tree was hewn, \\n\\nWhen young was mountain under moon; \\n\\nEre ring was made, or wrought was woe, \\n\\nIt walked the forests long ago. \\' \\n\\n\\'And what may be the answer to your riddle?\\' said Thjoden. \\n\\n\\'If you would learn that, you should come with me to Isengard \\' \\nanswered Gandalf. \\n\\n\\'To Isengard?\\' they cried. \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Gandalf. \\'I shall return to Isengard, and those who will \\nmay come with me. There we may see strange things.\\' \\n\\n\\'But there are not men enough in the Mark, not if they were all \\ngathered together and healed of wounds and weariness, to assault the \\nstronghold of Saruman,\\' said Thjoden. \\n\\n\\'Nevertheless to Isengard I go,\\' said Gandalf. \\'I shall not stay there \\nlong. My way lies now eastward. Look for me in Edoras, ere the waning of the \\nmoon!\\' \\n\\n\\'Nay!\\' said Thjoden. \\'In the dark hour before dawn I doubted, but we \\nwill not part now. I will come with you, if that is your counsel.\\' \\n\\n\\'I wish to speak with Saruman, as soon as may be now,\\' said Gandalf, \\n\\n\\'and since he has done you great injury, it would be fitting if you were \\nthere. But how soon and how swiftly will you ride?\\' \\n\\n\\'My men are weary with battle,\\' said the King; \\'and I am weary also. \\n\\nFor I have ridden far and slept little. Alas! My old age is not feigned nor \\ndue only to the whisperings of Wormtongue. It is an ill that no leech can \\nwholly cure, not even Gandalf.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then let all who are to ride with me rest now,\\' said Gandalf. \\'We will \\njourney under the shadow of evening. It is as well; for it is my counsel \\nthat all our comings and goings should be as secret as may be, henceforth. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut do not command many men to go with you, Thjoden. We go to a parley \\nnot \\n\\nto a fight.\\' \\n\\nThe King then chose men that were unhurt and had swift horses, and he \\nsent them forth with tidings of the victory into every vale of the Mark; and \\nthey bore his summons also, bidding all men, young and old, to come in haste \\nto Edoras. There the Lord of the Mark would hold an assembly of all that \\ncould bear arms, on the second day after the full moon. To ride with him to \\nIsengard the King chose Jomer and twenty men of his household. With \\nGandalf \\n\\nwould go Aragorn, and Legolas, and Gimli. In spite of his hurt the dwarf \\nwould not stay behind. \\n\\n\\'It was only a feeble blow and the cap turned it;\\' he said. \\'It would \\ntake more than such an orc-scratch to keep me back.\\' \\n\\n\\'I will tend it, while you rest,\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\nThe king now returned to the Hornburg, and slept, such a sleep of quiet \\nas he had not known for many years, and the remainder of his chosen company \\nrested also. But the others, all that were not hurt or wounded, began a \\ngreat labour; for many had fallen in the battle and lay dead upon the field \\nor in the Deep. \\n\\nNo Ores remained alive; their bodies were uncounted. But a great many \\nof the hillmen had given themselves up; and they were afraid, and cried for \\nmercy. \\n\\nThe Men of the Mark took their weapons from them, and set them to work. \\n\\n\\'Help now to repair the evil in which you have joined,\\' said \\nErkenbrand; \\'and afterwards you shall take an oath never again to pass the \\nFords of Isen in arms, nor to march with the enemies of Men; and then you \\nshall go free back to your land. For you have been deluded by Saruman. Many \\nof you have got death as the reward of your trust in him; but had you \\nconquered, little better would your wages have been.\\' \\n\\nThe men of Dunland were amazed, for Saruman had told them that the men \\nof Rohan were cruel and burned their captives alive. \\n\\nIn the midst of the field before the Hornburg two mounds were raised, \\nand beneath them were laid all the Riders of the Mark who fell in the \\ndefence, those of the East Dales upon one side, and those of Westfold upon \\nthe other. In a_ grave alone under the shadow of the Hornburg lay Hbma, \\ncaptain of the King\\'s guard. He fell before the Gate. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Ores were piled in great heaps, away from the mounds of Men, not \\nfar from the eaves of the forest. And the people were troubled in their \\nminds; for the heaps of carrion were too great for burial or for burning. \\n\\nThey had little wood for firing, and none would have dared to take an axe to \\nthe strange trees, even if Gandalf had not warned them to hurt neither bark \\nnor bough at their great peril. \\n\\n\\'Let the Ores lie,\\' said Gandalf. \\'The morning may bring new counsel.\\' \\n\\nIn the afternoon the King\\'s company prepared to depart. The work of \\nburial was then but beginning; and Thjoden mourned for the loss of Hbma, his \\ncaptain, and cast the first earth upon his grave. \\'Great injury indeed has \\nSaruman done to me and all this land,\\' he said; \\'and I will remember it, \\nwhen we meet.\\' \\n\\nThe sun was already drawing near the hills upon the west of the Coomb, \\nwhen at last Thjoden and Gandalf and their companions rode down from the \\nDike. Behind them were gathered a great host, both of the Riders and of the \\npeople of Westfold, old and young, women and children, who had come out \\nfrom \\n\\nthe caves. A song of victory they sang with clear voices; and then they fell \\nsilent, wondering what would chance, for their eyes were on the trees and \\nthey feared them. \\n\\nThe Riders came to the wood, and they halted; horse and man, they were \\nunwilling to pass in. The trees were grey and menacing, and a shadow or a \\nmist was about them. The ends of their long sweeping boughs hung down like \\nsearching fingers, their roots stood up from the ground like the limbs of \\nstrange monsters, and dark caverns opened beneath them. But Gandalf went \\nforward, leading the company, and where the road from the Hornburg met the \\ntrees they saw now an opening like an arched gate under mighty boughs; and \\nthrough it Gandalf passed, and they followed him. Then to their amazement \\nthey found that the road ran on, and the Deeping-stream beside it; and the \\nsky was open above and full of golden light. But on either side the great \\naisles of the wood were already wrapped in dusk, stretching away into \\nimpenetrable shadows; and there they heard the creaking and groaning of \\nboughs, and far cries, and a rumour of wordless voices, murmuring angrily. \\nNo Ore or other living creature could be seen. \\n\\nLegolas and Gimli were now riding together upon one horse; and they \\nkept close beside Gandalf, for Gimli was afraid of the wood. \\n\\n\\'It is hot in here,\\' said Legolas to Gandalf. \\'I feel a great wrath \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nabout me. Do you not feel the air throb in your ears?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Gandalf. \\n\\n\\'What has become of the miserable Ores?\\' said Legolas. \\n\\n\\'That, I think, no one will ever know,\\' said Gandalf. \\n\\nThey rode in silence for a while; but Legolas was ever glancing from \\nside to side, and would often have halted to listen to the sounds of the \\nwood, if Gimli had allowed it. \\n\\n\\'These are the strangest trees that ever I saw,\\' he said; \\'and I have \\nseen many an oak grow from acorn to ruinous age. I wish that there were \\nleisure now to walk among them: they have voices, and in time I might come \\nto understand their thought.\\' \\n\\n\\'No, no!\\' said Gimli. \\'Let us leave them! I guess their thought \\nalready: hatred of all that go on two legs; and their speech is of crushing \\nand strangling.\\' \\n\\n\\'Not of all that go on two legs,\\' said Legolas. \\'There I think you are \\nwrong. It is Ores that they hate. For they do not belong here and know \\nlittle of Elves and Men. Far away are the valleys where they sprang. From \\nthe deep dales of Fangorn, Gimli, that is whence they come, I guess.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then that is the most perilous wood in Middle-earth,\\' said Gimli. \\'I \\nshould be grateful for the part they have played, but I do not love them. \\n\\nYou may think them wonderful, but I have seen a greater wonder in this land, \\nmore beautiful than any grove or glade that ever grew: my heart is still \\nfull of ft. \\'Strange are the ways of Men, Legolas ! Here they have one of the \\nmarvels of the Northern World, and what do they say of it? Caves, they say! \\nCaves! Holes to fly to in time of war, to store fodder in! My good Legolas, \\ndo you know that the caverns of Helm\\'s Deep are vast and beautiful? There \\nwould be an endless pilgrimage of Dwarves, merely to gaze at them, if such \\nthings were known to be. Aye indeed, they would pay pure gold for a brief \\nglance!\\' \\n\\n\\'And I would give gold to be excused,\\' said Legolas; \\'and double to be \\nlet out, if I strayed in!\\' \\n\\n\\'You have not seen, so I forgive your jest,\\' said Gimli. \\'But you speak \\nlike a fool. Do you think those halls are fair, where your King dwells under \\nthe hill in Mirkwood, and Dwarves helped in their making long ago? They are \\nbut hovels compared with the caverns I have seen here: immeasurable halls, \\nfilled with an everlasting music of water that tinkles into pools, as fair \\nas Kheled-zvram in the starlight. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'And, Legolas, when the torches are kindled and men walk on the sandy \\nfloors under the echoing domes, ah! then, Legolas, gems and crystals and \\nveins of precious ore glint in the polished walls; and the light glows \\nthrough folded marbles, shell-like, translucent as the living hands of Queen \\nGaladriel. There are columns of white and saffron and dawn-rose, Legolas, \\nfluted and twisted into dreamlike forms; they spring up from many-coloured \\nfloors to meet the glistening pendants of the roof: wings, ropes, curtains \\nfine as frozen clouds; spears, banners, pinnacles of suspended palaces! \\n\\nStill lakes mirror them: a glimmering world looks up from dark pools covered \\nwith clear glass; cities, such as the mind of Durin could scarce have \\nimagined in his sleep, stretch on through avenues and pillared courts, on \\ninto the dark recesses where no light can come. And plink! a silver drop \\nfalls, and the round wrinkles in the glass make all the towers bend and \\nwaver like weeds and corals in a grotto of the sea. Then evening comes: they \\nfade and twinkle out; the torches pass on into another chamber and another \\ndream. There is chamber after chamber, Legolas; hall opening out of hall, \\ndome after dome, stair beyond stair; and still the winding paths lead on \\ninto the mountains\\' heart. Caves! The Caverns of Helm\\'s Deep! Happy was the \\nchance that drove me there! It makes me weep to leave them.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then I will wish you this fortune for your comfort, Gimli,\\' said the \\nElf, \\'that you may come safe from war and return to see them again. But do \\nnot tell all your kindred! There seems little left for them to do, from your \\naccount. Maybe the men of this land are wise to say little: one family of \\nbusy dwarves with hammer and chisel might mar more than they made.\\' \\n\\n\\'No, you do not understand,\\' said Gimli. \\'No dwarf could be unmoved by \\nsuch loveliness. None of Durin\\'s race would mine those caves for stones or \\nore, not if diamonds and gold could be got there. Do you cut down groves of \\nblossoming trees in the spring-time for firewood? We would tend these glades \\nof flowering stone, not quarry them. With cautious skill, tap by tap -- a \\nsmall chip of rock and no more, perhaps, in a whole anxious day -- so we \\ncould work, and as the years went by, we should open up new ways, and \\ndisplay far chambers that are still dark, glimpsed only as a void beyond \\nfissures in the rock. And lights, Legolas! We should make lights, such lamps \\nas once shone in Khazad-dym; and when we wished we would drive away \\nthe \\n\\nnight that has lain there since the hills were made; and when we desired \\nrest, we would let the night return.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'You move me, Gimli,\\' said Legolas. \\'I have never heard you speak like \\nthis before. Almost you make me regret that I have not seen these caves. \\nCome! Let us make this bargain-if we both return safe out of the perils that \\nawait us, we will journey for a while together. You shall visit Fangorn with \\nme, and then I will come with you to see Helm\\'s Deep.\\' \\n\\n\\'That would not be the way of return that I should choose,\\' said Gimli. \\n\\n\\'But I will endure Fangorn, if I have your promise to come back to the caves \\nand share their wonder with me.\\' \\n\\n\\'You have my promise,\\' said Legolas. \\'But alas! Now we must leave \\nbehind both cave and wood for a while: See! We are coming to the end of the \\ntrees. How far is it to Isengard, Gandalf?\\' \\n\\n\\'About fifteen leagues, as the crows of Saruman make it.\\' said Gandalf: \\n\\n\\'five from the mouth of Deeping-coomb to the Fords: and ten more from there \\nto the gates of Isengard. But we shall not ride all the way this night.\\' \\n\\n\\'And when we come there, what shall we see?\\' asked Gimli. \\'You may \\nknow, but I cannot guess.\\' \\n\\n\\'I do not know myself for certain,\\' answered the wizard. \\'I was there \\nat nightfall yesterday, but much may have happened since. Yet I think that \\nyou will not say that the journey was in vain -- not though the Glittering \\nCaves of Aglarond be left behind.\\' \\n\\nAt last the company passed through the trees, and found that they had \\ncome to the bottom of the Coomb, where the road from Helm\\'s Deep \\nbranched, \\n\\ngoing one way east to Edoras, and the other north to the Fords of Isen. As \\nthey rode from under the eaves of the wood, Legolas halted and looked back \\nwith regret. Then he gave a sudden cry. \\n\\n\\'There are eyes!\\' he said. \\'Eyes looking out from the shadows of the \\nboughs! I never saw such eyes before.\\' \\n\\nThe others, surprised by his cry, halted and turned; but Legolas \\nstarted to ride back. \\n\\n\\'No, no!\\' cried Gimli. \\'Do as you please in your madness, but let me \\nfirst get down from this horse! I wish to see no eyes!\\' \\'Stay, Legolas \\nGreenleaf!\\' said Gandalf. \\'Do not go back into the wood, not yet! Now is not \\nyour time.\\' \\n\\nEven as he spoke, there came forward out of the trees three strange \\nshapes. As tall as trolls they were, twelve feet or more in height; their \\nstrong bodies, stout as young trees, seemed to be clad with raiment or with \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhide of close-fitting grey and brown. Their limbs were long, and their hands \\nhad many fingers; their hair was stiff, and their beards grey-green as moss. \\nThey gazed out with solemn eyes, but they were not looking at the riders: \\ntheir eyes were bent northwards. Suddenly they lifted their long hands to \\ntheir mouths, and sent forth ringing calls, clear as notes of a horn, but \\nmore musical and various. The calls were answered; and turning again, the \\nriders saw other creatures of the same kind approaching, striding through \\nthe grass. They came swiftly from the North, walking like wading herons in \\ntheir gait, but not in their speed; for their legs in their long paces beat \\nquicker than the heron\\'s wings. The riders cried aloud in wonder, and some \\nset their hands upon their sword-hilts. \\n\\n\\'You need no weapons,\\' said Gandalf. \\'These are but herdsmen. They are \\nnot enemies, indeed they are not concerned with us at all.\\' \\n\\nSo it seemed to be; for as he spoke the tall creatures, without a \\nglance at the riders, strode into the wood and vanished. \\n\\n\\'Herdsmen!\\' said Thjoden. \\'Where are their flocks? What are they, \\nGandalf? For it is plain that to you, at any rate, they are not strange.\\' \\n\\n\\'They are the shepherds of the trees,\\' answered Gandalf. \\'Is it so long \\nsince you listened to tales by the fireside? There are children in your land \\nwho, out of the twisted threads of story, could pick the answer to your \\nquestion. You have seen Ents, O King, Ents out of Fangorn Forest, which in \\nyour tongue you call the Entwood. Did you think that the name was given only \\nin idle fancy? Nay, Thjoden, it is otherwise: to them you are but the \\npassing tale; all the years from Eorl the Young to Thjoden the Old are of \\nlittle count to them; and all the deeds of your house but a small matter.\\' \\n\\nThe king was silent. \\'Ents!\\' he said at length. \\'Out of the shadows of \\nlegend I begin a little to understand the marvel of the trees, I think. I \\nhave lived to see strange days. Long we have tended our beasts and our \\nfields, built our houses, wrought our tools, or ridden away to help in the \\nwars of Minas Tirith. And that we called the life of Men, the way of the \\nworld. We cared little for what lay beyond the borders of our land. Songs we \\nhave that tell of these things, but we are forgetting them, teaching them \\nonly to children, as a careless custom. And now the songs have come down \\namong us out of strange places, and walk visible under the Sun.\\' \\n\\n\\'You should be glad, Thjoden King,\\' said Gandalf. \\'For not only the \\nlittle life of Men is now endangered, but the life also of those things \\nwhich you have deemed the matter of legend. You are not without allies, even \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nif you know them not.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yet also I should be sad,\\' said Thjoden. \\'For however the fortune of \\nwar shall go, may it not so end that much that was fair and wonderful shall \\npass for ever out of Middle-earth?\\' \\n\\n\\'It may,\\' said Gandalf. \\'The evil of Sauron cannot be wholly cured, nor \\nmade as if it had not been. But to such days we are doomed. Let us now go on \\nwith the journey we have begun!\\' \\n\\nThe company turned then away from the Coomb and from the wood and \\ntook \\n\\nthe road towards the Fords. Legolas followed reluctantly. The sun had set, \\nalready it had sunk behind the rim of the world; but as they rode out from \\nthe shadow of the hills and looked west to the Gap of Rohan the sky was \\nstill red, and a burning light was under the floating clouds. Dark against \\nit there wheeled and flew many black -winged birds. Some passed overhead \\nwith \\n\\nmournful cries, returning to their homes among the rocks. \\n\\n\\'The carrion-fowl have been busy about the battle-field,\\' said Jomer. \\n\\nThey rode now at an easy pace and dark came down upon the plains about \\nthem. The slow moon mounted, now waxing towards the full, and in its cold \\nsilver light the swelling grass-lands rose and fell like a wide grey sea. \\n\\nThey had ridden for some four hours from the branching of the roads when \\nthey drew near to the Fords. Long slopes ran swiftly down to where the river \\nspread in stony shoals between high grassy terraces. Borne upon the wind \\nthey heard the howling of wolves. Their hearts were heavy, remembering the \\nmany men that had fallen in battle in this place. \\n\\nThe road dipped between rising turf-banks, carving its way through the \\nterraces to the river\\'s edge, and up again upon the further side. There were \\nthree lines of flat stepping-stones across the stream, and between them \\nfords for horses, that went from either brink to a bare eyot in the midst. \\n\\nThe riders looked down upon the crossings, and it seemed strange to them; \\nfor the Fords had ever been a place full of the rush and chatter of water \\nupon stones; but now they were silent. The beds of the stream were almost \\ndry, a bare waste of shingles and grey sand. \\n\\n\\'This is become a dreary place,\\' said Jomer. \\'What sickness has \\nbefallen the river? Many fair things Saruman has destroyed: has he devoured \\nthe springs of Isen too?\\' \\'So it would seem,\\' said Gandalf. \\n\\n\\'Alas!\\' said Thjoden. \\'Must we pass this way, where the carrion-beasts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndevour so many good Riders of the Mark?\\' \\n\\nThis is our way,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Grievous is the fall of your men; but \\nyou shall see that at least the wolves of the mountains do not devour them. \\n\\nIt is with their friends, the Ores, that they hold their feast: such indeed \\nis the friendship of their kind. Come!\\' \\n\\nThey rode down to the river, and as they came the wolves ceased their \\nhowling and slunk away. Fear fell on them seeing Gandalf in the moon, and \\nShadowfax his horse shining like silver. The riders passed over to the \\nislet, and glittering eyes watched them wanly from the shadows of the banks. \\n\\n\\'Look!\\' said Gandalf. \\'Friends have laboured here.\\' \\n\\nAnd they saw that in the midst of the eyot a mound was piled, ringed \\nwith stones, and set about with many spears. \\n\\n\\'Here lie all the Men of the Mark that fell near this place,\\' said \\nGandalf. \\n\\n\\'Here let them rest!\\' said Jomer. \\'And when their spears have rotted \\nand rusted, long still may their mound stand and guard the Fords of Isen!\\' \\n\\n\\'Is this your work also, Gandalf, my friend?\\' said Thjoden. \\'You \\naccomplished much in an evening and a night!\\' \\n\\n\\'With the help of Shadowfax -- and others,\\' said Gandalf. \\'I rode fast \\nand far. But here beside the mound I will say this for your comfort: many \\nfell in the battles of the Fords, but fewer than rumour made them. More were \\nscattered than were slain; I gathered together all that I could find. Some \\nmen I sent with Grimbold of Westfold to join Erkenbrand. Some I set to make \\nthis burial. They have now followed your marshal, Elfhelm. I sent him with \\nmany Riders to Edoras. Saruman I knew had despatched his full strength \\nagainst you, and his servants had turned aside from all other errands and \\ngone to Helm\\'s Deep: the lands seemed empty of enemies; yet I feared that \\nwolf-riders and plunderers might ride nonetheless to Meduseld, while it was \\nundefended. But now I think you need not fear: you will find your house to \\nwelcome your return.\\' \\n\\n\\'And glad shall I be to see it again,\\' said Thjoden, \\'though brief now, \\n\\nI doubt not, shall be my abiding there.\\' \\n\\nWith that the company said farewell to the island and the mound, and \\npassed over the river, and climbed the further bank. Then they rode on, glad \\nto have left the mournful Fords. As they went the howling of the wolves \\nbroke out anew. \\n\\nThere was an ancient highway that ran down from Isengard to the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncrossings. For some way it took its course beside the river, bending with it \\neast and then north; but at the last it turned away and went straight \\ntowards the gates of Isengard; and these were under the mountain-side in the \\nwest of the valley, sixteen miles or more from its mouth. This road they \\nfollowed but they did not ride upon it; for the ground beside it was firm \\nand level, covered for many miles about with short springing turf. They rode \\nnow more swiftly, and by midnight the Fords were nearly five leagues behind. \\nThen they halted, ending their night\\'s journey, for the King was weary. They \\nwere come to the feet of the Misty Mountains, and the long arms of Nan \\nCurunnr stretched down to meet them. Dark lay the vale before them, for the \\nmoon had passed into the West, and its light was hidden by the hills. But \\nout of the deep shadow of the dale rose a vast spire of smoke and vapour; as \\nit mounted, it caught the rays of the sinking moon, and spread in shimmering \\nbillows, black and silver, over the starry sky. \\n\\n\\'What do you think of that, Gandalf?\\' asked Aragorn. \\'One would say \\nthat all the Wizard\\'s Vale was burning.\\' \\n\\n\\'There is ever a fume above that valley in these days,\\' said Jomer: \\n\\n\\'but I have never seen aught like this before. These are steams rather than \\nsmokes. Saruman is brewing some devilry to greet us. Maybe he is boiling all \\nthe waters of Isen, and that is why the river runs dry.\\' \\n\\n\\'Maybe he is,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Tomorrow we shall learn what he is doing. \\nNow let us rest for a while, if we can.\\' \\n\\nThey camped beside the bed of the Isen river; it was still silent and \\nempty. Some of them slept a little. But late in the night the watchmen cried \\nout, and all awoke. The moon was gone. Stars were shining above; but over \\nthe ground there crept a darkness blacker than the night. On both sides of \\nthe river it rolled towards them, going northward. \\n\\n\\'Stay where you are!\\' said Gandalf. \\'Draw no weapons! Wait! and it will \\npass you by!\\' \\n\\nA mist gathered about them. Above them a few stars still glimmered \\nfaintly; but on either side there arose walls of impenetrable gloom; they \\nwere in a narrow lane between moving towers of shadow. Voices they heard, \\nwhisperings and groanings and an endless rustling sigh; the earth shook \\nunder them. Long it seemed to them that they sat and were afraid; but at \\nlast the darkness and the rumour passed, and vanished between the mountain\\'s \\narms. \\n\\nAway south upon the Hornburg, in the middle night men heard a great \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnoise, as a wind in the valley, and the ground trembled; and all were afraid \\nand no one ventured to go forth. But in the morning they went out and were \\namazed; for the slain Ores were gone, and the trees also. Far down into the \\nvalley of the Deep the grass was crushed and trampled brown, as if giant \\nherdsmen had pastured great droves of cattle there; but a mile below the \\nDike a huge pit had been delved in the earth, and over it stones were piled \\ninto a hill. Men believed that the Ores whom they had slain were buried \\nthere; but whether those who had fled into the wood were with them, none \\ncould say, for no man ever set foot upon that hill. The Death Down it was \\nafterwards called, and no grass would grow there. But the strange trees were \\nnever seen in Deeping-coomb again; they had returned at night, and had gone \\nfar away to the dark dales of Fangorn. Thus they were revenged upon the \\nOres. \\n\\nThe king and his company slept no more that night; but they saw and \\nheard no other strange thing, save one: the voice of the river beside them \\nsuddenly awoke. There was a rush of water hurrying down among the stones; \\nand when it had passed, the Isen flowed and bubbled in its bed again, as it \\nhad ever done. \\n\\nAt dawn they made ready to go on. The light came grey and pale, and \\nthey did not see the rising of the sun. The air above was heavy with fog, \\nand a reek lay on the land about them. They went slowly, riding now upon the \\nhighway. It was broad and hard, and well-tended. Dimly through the mists \\nthey could descry the long arm of the mountains rising on their left. They \\nhad passed into Nan Curunnr, the Wizard\\'s Vale. That was a sheltered valley, \\nopen only to the South. Once it had been fair and green, and through it the \\nIsen flowed, already deep and strong before it found the plains; for it was \\nfed by many springs and lesser streams among the rain-washed hills, and all \\nabout it there had lain a pleasant, fertile land. \\n\\nIt was not so now. Beneath the walls of Isengard there still were acres \\ntilled by the slaves of Saruman; but most of the valley had become a \\nwilderness of weeds and thorns. Brambles trailed upon the ground, or \\nclambering over bush and bank, made shaggy caves where small beasts \\nhoused. \\n\\nNo trees grew there; but among the rank grasses could still be seen the \\nburned and axe-hewn stumps of ancient groves. It was a sad country, silent \\nnow but for the stony noise of quick waters. Smokes and steams drifted in \\nsullen clouds and lurked in the hollows. The riders did not speak. Many \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndoubted in their hearts, wondering to what dismal end their journey led. \\n\\nAfter they had ridden for some miles, the highway became a wide street, \\npaved with great flat stones, squared and laid with skill; no blade of grass \\nwas seen in any joint. Deep gutters, filled with trickling water, ran down \\non either side. Suddenly a tall pillar loomed up before them. It was black; \\nand set upon it was a great stone, carved and painted in the likeness of a \\nlong White Hand. Its finger pointed north. Not far now they knew that the \\ngates of Isengard must stand, and their hearts were heavy; but their eyes \\ncould not pierce the mists ahead. \\n\\nBeneath the mountain\\'s arm within the Wizard\\'s Vale through years \\nuncounted had stood that ancient place that Men called Isengard. Partly it \\nwas shaped in the making of the mountains, but mighty works the Men of \\nWesternesse had wrought there of old; and Saruman had dwelt there long and \\nhad not been idle. \\n\\nThis was its fashion, while Saruman was at his height, accounted by \\nmany the chief of Wizards. A great ring-wall of stone, like towering cliffs, \\nstood out from the shelter of the mountain- side, from which it ran and then \\nreturned again. One entrance only was there made in it, a great arch delved \\nin the southern wall. Here through the black rock a long tunnel had been \\nhewn, closed at either end with mighty doors of iron. They were so wrought \\nand poised upon their huge hinges, posts of steel driven into the living \\nstone, that when unbarred they could be moved with a light thrust of the \\narms, noiselessly. One who passed in and came at length out of the echoing \\ntunnel, beheld a plain, a great circle, somewhat hollowed like a vast \\nshallow bowl: a mile it measured from rim to rim. Once it had been green and \\nfilled with avenues, and groves of fruitful trees, watered by streams that \\nflowed from the mountains to a lake. But no green thing grew there in the \\nlatter days of Saruman. The roads were paved with stone-flags, dark and \\nhard; and beside their borders instead of trees there marched long lines of \\npillars, some of marble, some of copper and of iron, joined by heavy chains. \\n\\nMany houses there were, chambers, halls, and passages, cut and \\ntunnelled back into the walls upon their inner side, so that all the open \\ncircle was overlooked by countless windows and dark doors. Thousands could \\ndwell there, workers, servants, slaves, and warriors with great store of \\narms; wolves were fed and stabled in deep dens beneath. The plain, too, was \\nbored and delved. Shafts were driven deep into the ground; their upper ends \\nwere covered by low mounds and domes of stone, so that in the moonlight the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRing of Isengard looked like a graveyard of unquiet dead. For the ground \\ntrembled. The shafts ran down by many slopes and spiral stairs to caverns \\nfar under; there Saruman had treasuries, store-houses, armouries, smithies, \\nand great furnaces. Iron wheels revolved there endlessly, and hammers \\nthudded. At night plumes of vapour steamed from the vents, lit from beneath \\nwith red light, or blue, or venomous green. \\n\\nTo the centre all the roads ran between their chains. There stood a \\ntower of marvellous shape. It was fashioned by the builders of old, who \\nsmoothed the Ring of Isengard, and yet it seemed a thing not made by the \\ncraft of Men, but riven from the bones of the earth in the ancient torment \\nof the hills. A peak and isle of rock it was. black and gleaming hard: four \\nmighty piers of many-sided stone were welded into one, but near the summit \\nthey opened into gaping horns, their pinnacles sharp as the points of \\nspears, keen-edged as knives. Between them was a narrow space, and there \\nupon a floor of polished stone, written with strange signs, a man might \\nstand five hundred feet above the plain. This was Orthanc, the citadel of \\nSaruman, the name of which had (by design or chance) a twofold meaning; for \\nin the Elvish speech orthanc signifies Mount Fang, but in the language of \\nthe Mark of old the Cunning Mind. \\n\\nA strong place and wonderful was Isengard, and long it had been \\nbeautiful; and there great lords had dwelt, the wardens of Gondor upon the \\nWest, and wise men that watched the stars. But Saruman had slowly shaped it \\nto his shifting purposes, and made it better, as he thought, being \\ndeceived-for all those arts and subtle devices, for which he forsook his \\nformer wisdom, and which fondly he imagined were his own. came but \\nfrom \\n\\nMordor; so that what he made was naught, only a little copy, a child\\'s model \\nor a slave\\'s flattery, of that vast fortress, armoury, prison, furnace of \\ngreat power, Barad-dyr, the Dark Tower, which suffered no rival, and laughed \\nat flattery, biding its time, secure in its pride and its immeasurable \\nstrength. \\n\\nThis was the stronghold of Saruman, as fame reported it; for within \\nliving memory the men of Rohan had not passed its gates, save perhaps a few, \\nsuch as Wormtongue, who came in secret and told no man what they saw. \\n\\nNow Gandalf rode to the great pillar of the Hand, and passed it: and as \\nhe did so the Riders saw to their wonder that the Hand appeared no longer \\nwhite. It was stained as with dried blood; and looking closer they perceived \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthat its nails were red. Unheeding Gandalf rode on into the mist, and \\nreluctantly they followed him. All about them now, as if there had been a \\nsudden flood, wide pools of water lay beside the road, filling the hollows, \\nand rills went trickling down among the stones. \\n\\nAt last Gandalf halted and beckoned to them; and they came, and saw \\nthat beyond him the mists had cleared, and a pale sunlight shone. The hour \\nof noon had passed. They were come to the doors of Isengard. \\n\\nBut the doors lay hurled and twisted on the ground. And all about, \\nstone, cracked and splintered into countless jagged shards, was scattered \\nfar and wide, or piled in ruinous heaps. The great arch still stood, but it \\nopened now upon a roofless chasm: the tunnel was laid bare, and through the \\ncliff-like walls on either side great rents and breaches had been torn; \\ntheir towers were beaten into dust. If the Great Sea had risen in wrath and \\nfallen on the hills with storm, it could have worked no greater ruin. \\n\\nThe ring beyond was filled with steaming water: a bubbling cauldron, in \\nwhich there heaved and floated a wreckage of beams and spars, chests and \\ncasks and broken gear. Twisted and leaning pillars reared their splintered \\nstems above the flood, but all the roads were drowned. Far off, it seemed, \\nhalf veiled in winding cloud, there loomed the island rock. Still dark and \\ntall, unbroken by the storm, the tower of Orthanc stood. Pale waters lapped \\nabout its feet. \\n\\nThe king and all his company sat silent on their horses, marvelling, \\nperceiving that the power of Saruman was overthrown; but how they could not \\nguess. And now they turned their eyes towards the archway and the ruined \\ngates. There they saw close beside them a great rubble-heap; and suddenly \\nthey were aware of two small figures lying on it at their ease, grey-clad, \\nhardly to be seen among the stones. There were bottles and bowls and \\nplatters laid beside them, as if they had just eaten well, and now rested \\nfrom their labour. One seemed asleep; the other, with crossed legs and arms \\nbehind his head, leaned back against a broken rock and sent from his mouth \\nlong wisps and little rings of thin blue smoke. \\n\\nFor a moment Thjoden and Jomer and all his men stared at them in \\nwonder. Amid all the wreck of Isengard this seemed to them the strangest \\nsight. But before the king could speak, the small smoke-breathing figure \\nbecame suddenly aware of them, as they sat there silent on the edge of the \\nmist. He sprang to his feet. A young man he looked, or like one, though not \\nmuch more than half a man in height; his head of brown curling hair was \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nuncovered, but he was clad in a travel-stained cloak of the same hue and \\nshape as the companions of Gandalf had worn when they rode to Edoras. He \\nbowed very low. putting his hand upon his breast. Then, seeming not to \\nobserve the wizard and his friends, he turned to Jomer and the king. \\n\\n\\'Welcome, my lords, to Isengard!\\' he said. \\'We are the doorwardens. \\nMeriadoc, son of Saradoc is my name; and my companion, who, alas! is \\novercome with weariness\\' -- here he gave the other a dig with his foot -- \\n\\n\\'is Peregrin, son of Paladin, of the house of Took. Far in the North is our \\nhome. The Lord Saruman is within; but at the moment he is closeted with one \\nWormtongue, or doubtless he would be here to welcome such honourable \\nguests.\\' \\n\\n\\'Doubtless he would!\\' laughed Gandalf. \\'And was it Saruman that ordered \\nyou to guard his damaged doors, and watch for the arrival of guests, when \\nyour attention could be spared from plate and bottle?\\' \\n\\n\\'No, good sir, the matter escaped him,\\' answered Merry gravely \\'He has \\nbeen much occupied. Our orders came from Treebeard, who has taken over \\nthe \\n\\nmanagement of Isengard. He commanded me to welcome the Lord of Rohan \\nwith \\n\\nfitting words. I have done my best.\\' \\n\\n\\'And what about your companions? What about Legolas and me?\\' cried \\nGimli, unable to contain himself longer. \\'You rascals, you woolly-footed and \\nwool-pated truants ! A fine hunt you have led us! Two hundred leagues, \\nthrough fen and forest, battle and death, to rescue you ! And here we find \\nyou feasting and idling -and smoking ! Smoking! Where did you come by the \\nweed, you villains? Hammer and tongs! I am so torn between rage and joy, \\nthat if I do not burst, it will be a marvel!\\' \\n\\n\\'You speak for me, Gimli,\\' laughed Legolas. \\'Though I would sooner \\nlearn how they came by the wine.\\' \\n\\n\\'One thing you have not found in your hunting, and that\\'s brighter \\nwits,\\' said Pippin, opening an eye. \\'Here you find us sitting on a field of \\nvictory, amid the plunder of armies, and you wonder how we came by a few \\nwell-earned comforts!\\' \\n\\n\\'Well-earned?\\' said Gimli. \\'I cannot believe that!\\' \\n\\nThe Riders laughed. \\'It cannot be doubted that we witness the meeting \\nof dear friends,\\' said Thjoden. \\'So these are the lost ones of your company, \\nGandalf? The days are fated to be filled with marvels. Already I have seen \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmany since I left my house; and now here before my eyes stand yet another of \\nthe folk of legend. Are not these the Halflings, that some among us call the \\nHolbytlan?\\' \\n\\n\\'Hobbits, if you please, lord,\\' said Pippin. \\n\\n\\'Hobbits?\\' said Thjoden. \\'Your tongue is strangely changed; but the \\nname sounds not unfitting so. Hobbits! No report that I have heard does \\njustice to the truth.\\' \\n\\nMerry bowed; and Pippin got up and bowed low. \\'You are gracious, lord; \\nor I hope that I may so take your words,\\' he said. \\'And here is another \\nmarvel! I have wandered in many lands, since I left my home, and never till \\nnow have I found people that knew any story concerning hobbits.\\' \\n\\n\\'My people came out of the North long ago,\\' said Thjoden. \\'But I will \\nnot deceive you: we know no tales about hobbits. All that is said among us \\nis that far away, over many hills and rivers, live the halfling folk that \\ndwell in holes in sand-dunes. But there are no legends of their deeds, for \\nit is said that they do little, and avoid the sight of men, being able to \\nvanish in a twinkling: and they can change their voices to resemble the \\npiping of birds. But it seems that more could be said.\\' \\n\\n\\'It could indeed, lord,\\' said Merry. \\n\\n\\'For one thing,\\' said Thjoden, \\'I had not heard that they spouted smoke \\nfrom their mouths.\\' \\n\\n\\'That is not surprising,\\' answered Merry; \\'for it is an art which we \\nhave not practised for more than a few generations. It was Tobold \\nHornblower, of Longbottom in the Southfarthing, who first grew the true \\npipe-weed in his gardens, about the year 1070 according to our reckoning. \\nHow old Toby came by the plant...\\' \\n\\n\\'You do not know your danger, Thjoden,\\' interrupted Gandalf. \\'These \\nhobbits will sit on the edge of ruin and discuss the pleasures of the table, \\nor the small doings of their fathers, grandfathers, and great-grandfathers, \\nand remoter cousins to the ninth degree, if you encourage them with undue \\npatience. Some other time would be more fitting for the history of smoking. \\nWhere is Treebeard, Merry?\\' \\n\\n\\'Away on the north side, I believe. He went to get a drink-of clean \\nwater. Most of the other Ents are with him, still busy at their work -- over \\nthere.\\' Merry waved his hand towards the steaming lake; and as they looked, \\nthey heard a distant rumbling and rattling, as if an avalanche was falling \\nfrom the mountain-side. Far away came a hoom-hom, as of horns blowing \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntriumphantly. \\n\\n\\'And is Orthanc then left unguarded?\\' asked Gandalf. \\n\\n\\'There is the water,\\' said Merry. \\'But Quickbeam and some others are \\nwatching it. Not all those posts and pillars in the plain are of Saruman\\'s \\nplanting. Quickbeam, I think, is by the rock, near the foot of the stair.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, a tall grey Ent is there,\\' said Legolas, \\'but his arms are at his \\nsides, and he stands as still as a door -tree.\\' \\n\\n\\'It is past noon,\\' said Gandalf, \\'and we at any rate have not eaten \\nsince early morning. Yet I wish to see Treebeard as soon as may be. Did he \\nleave me no message, or has plate and bottle driven it from your mind?\\' \\n\\n\\'He left a message,\\' said Merry, \\'and I was coming to it, but I have \\nbeen hindered by many other questions. I was to say that, if the Lord of the \\nMark and Gandalf will ride to the northern wall they will find Treebeard \\nthere, and he will welcome them. I may add that they will also find food of \\nthe best there, it was discovered and selected by your humble servants.\\' He \\nbowed. \\n\\nGandalf laughed. \\'That is better!\\' he said. \\'Well, Thjoden. will you \\nride with me to find Treebeard? We must go round about, but it is not far. \\nWhen you see Treebeard, you will learn much. For Treebeard is Fangorn, and \\nthe eldest and chief of the Ents, and when you speak with him you will hear \\nthe speech of the oldest of all living things.\\' \\n\\n\\'I will come with you,\\' said Thjoden. \\'Farewell, my hobbits! May we \\nmeet again in my house ! There you shall sit beside me and tell me all that \\nyour hearts desire: the deeds of your grandsires, as far as you can reckon \\nthem; and we will speak also of Tobold the Old and his herb-lore. Farewell!\\' \\n\\nThe hobbits bowed low. \\'So that is the King of Rohan!\\' said Pippin in \\nan undertone. \\'A fine old fellow. Very polite.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 9 . Flotsam and Jetsam \\n\\n\\n\\nGandalf and the King\\'s company rode away, turning eastward to make the \\ncircuit of the ruined walls of Isengard. But Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas \\nremained behind. Leaving Arod and Hasufel to stray in search of grass, they \\ncame and sat beside the hobbits. \\n\\n\\'Well, well! The hunt is over, and we meet again at last, where none of \\nus ever thought to come,\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\n\\'And now that the great ones have gone to discuss high matters,\\' said \\nLegolas, \\'the hunters can perhaps learn the answers to their own small \\nriddles. We tracked you as far as the forest, but there are still many \\nthings that I should like to know the truth of.\\' \\n\\n\\'And there is a great deal, too, that we want to know about you \\' said \\nMerry. \\'We have learnt a few things through Treebeard, the Old Ent, but that \\nis not nearly enough.\\' \\n\\n\\'All in good time,\\' said Legolas. \\'We were the hunters, and you should \\ngive an account of yourselves to us first.\\' \\n\\n\\'Or second,\\' said Gimli. \\'It would go better after a meal, t have a \\nsore head; and it is past mid-day. You truants might make amends by finding \\nus some of the plunder that you spoke of. Food and drink would pay off some \\nof my score against you.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then you shall have it,\\' said Pippin. \\'Will you have it here, or in \\nmore comfort in what\\'s left of Saruman\\'s guard-house-- over there under the \\narch? We had to picnic out here, so as to keep an eye on the road.\\' \\n\\n\\'Less than an eye!\\' said Gimli. \\'But I will not go into any ore-house \\nnor touch Ores\\' meat or anything that they have mauled.\\' \\n\\n\\'We wouldn\\'t ask you to,\\' said Merry. \\'We have had enough of Ores \\nourselves to last a life-time. But there were many other folk in Isengard. \\nSaruman kept enough wisdom not to trust his Ores. He had Men to guard his \\ngates: some of his most faithful servants, I suppose. Anyway they were \\nfavoured and got good provisions.\\' \\n\\n\\'And pipe-weed?\\' asked Gimli. \\n\\n\\'No, I don\\'t think so,\\' Merry laughed. \\'But that is another story, \\nwhich can wait until after lunch.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well let us go and have lunch then!\\' said the Dwarf. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe hobbits led the way; and they passed under the arch and came to a \\nwide door upon the left, at the top of a stair. It opened direct into a \\nlarge chamber, with other smaller doors at the far end, and a hearth and \\nchimney at one side. The chamber was hewn out of the stone; and it must once \\nhave been dark, for its windows looked out only into the tunnel. But light \\ncame in now through the broken roof. On the hearth wood was burning. \\n\\n\\'I lit a bit of fire,\\' said Pippin. \\'It cheered us up in the fogs. \\n\\nThere were few faggots about, and most of the wood we could find was wet. \\nBut there is a great draught in the chimney: it seems to wind away up \\nthrough the rock, and fortunately it has not been blocked. A fire is handy. \\n\\nI will make you some toast. The bread is three or four days old, I am \\nafraid.\\' \\n\\nAragorn and his companions sat themselves down at one end of a long \\ntable, and the hobbits disappeared through one of the inner doors. \\n\\'Store-room in there, and above the woods, luckily,\\' said Pippin, as they \\ncame back laden with dishes, bowls, cups, knives, and food of various sorts. \\n\\n\\'And you need not turn up your nose at the provender, Master Gimli,\\' \\nsaid Merry. \\'This is not ore-stuff, but man-food, as Treebeard calls it. \\n\\nWill you have wine or beer? There\\'s a barrel inside there -- very passable. \\n\\nAnd this is first-rate salted pork. Or I can cut you some rashers of bacon \\nand broil them, if you like. I am sorry there is no green stuff: the \\ndeliveries have been rather interrupted in the last few days! I cannot offer \\nyou anything to follow but butter and honey for your bread. Are you \\ncontent?\\' \\n\\n\\'Indeed yes,\\' said Gimli. \\'The score is much reduced.\\' \\n\\nThe three were soon busy with their meal; and the two hobbits, \\nunabashed, set to a second time. \\'We must keep our guests company,\\' they \\nsaid. \\n\\n\\'You are full of courtesy this morning,\\' laughed Legolas. \\'But maybe, \\nif we had not arrived, you would already have been keeping one another \\ncompany again.\\' \\n\\n\\'Maybe; and why not?\\' said Pippin. \\'We had foul fare with the Ores, and \\nlittle enough for days before that. It seems a long while since we could eat \\nto heart\\'s content.\\' \\n\\n\\'It does not seem to have done you any harm,\\' said Aragorn. \\'Indeed you \\nlook in the bloom of health.\\' \\n\\n\\'Aye, you do indeed,\\' said Gimli, looking them up and down over the top \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nof his cup. \\'Why, your hair is twice as thick and curly as when we parted; \\nand I would swear that you have both grown somewhat, if that is possible for \\nhobbits of your age. This Treebeard at any rate has not starved you.\\' \\n\\n\\'He has not,\\' said Merry. \\'But Ents only drink, and drink is not enough \\nfor content. Treebeard\\'s draughts may be nourishing, but one feels the need \\nof something solid. And even lembas is none the worse for a change.\\' \\n\\n\\'You have drunk of the waters of the Ents, have you?\\' said Legolas. \\n\\n\\'Ah, then I think it is likely that Gimli\\'s eyes do not deceive him. Strange \\nsongs have been sung of the draughts of Fangorn.\\' \\n\\n\\'Many strange tales have been told about that land,\\' said Aragorn. \\'I \\nhave never entered it. Come, tell me more about it, and about the Ents!\\' \\n\\n\\'Ents,\\' said Pippin, \\'Ents are -- well Ents are all different for on \\nthing. But their eyes now, their eyes are very odd.\\' He tried a few fumbling \\nwords that trailed off into silence. \\'Oh, well,\\' he went on, \\'you have seen \\nsome at a distance, already -they saw you at any rate, and reported that you \\nwere on the way-and you will see many others, I expect, before you leave \\nhere. You must form your own ideas.\\' \\n\\n\\'Now, now!\\' said Gimli. \\'We are beginning the story in the middle. I \\nshould like a tale in the right order, starting with that strange day when \\nour fellowship was broken.\\' \\n\\n\\'You shall have it, if there is time,\\' said Merry. \\'But first-if you \\nhave finished eating-you shall fill your pipes and light up. And then for a \\nlittle while we can pretend that we are all back safe at Bree again, or in \\nRivendell.\\' \\n\\nHe produced a small leather bag full of tobacco. \\'We have heaps of it,\\' \\nhe said; \\'and you can all pack as much as you wish, when we go. We did some \\nsalvage-work this morning, Pippin and I. There are lots of things floating \\nabout. It was Pippin who found two small barrels, washed up out of some \\ncellar or store-house, I suppose. When we opened them, we found they were \\nfilled with this: as fine a pipe- weed as you could wish for, and quite \\nunspoilt.\\' \\n\\nGimli took some and rubbed it in his palms and sniffed it. \\'It feels \\ngood, and it smells good,\\' he said. \\n\\n\\'It is good!\\' said Merry. \\'My dear Gimli, it is Longbottom Leaf! There \\nwere the Hornblower brandmarks on the barrels, as plain as plain. How it \\ncame here, I can\\'t imagine. For Saruman\\'s private use. I fancy. I never knew \\nthat it went so far abroad. But it comes in handy now?\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'It would,\\' said Gimli, \\'if I had a pipe to go with it. Alas, I lost \\nmine in Moria, or before. Is there no pipe in all your plunder?\\' \\n\\n\\'No, I am afraid not,\\' said Merry. \\'We have not found any, not even \\nhere in the guardrooms. Saruman kept this dainty to himself, it seems. And I \\ndon\\'t think it would be any use knocking on the doors of Orthanc to beg a \\npipe of him! We shall have to share pipes, as good friends must at a pinch.\\' \\n\\n\\'Half a moment!\\' said Pippin. Putting his hand inside the breast of his \\njacket he pulled out a little soft wallet on a string. \\'I keep a treasure or \\ntwo near my skin, as precious as Rings to me. Here\\'s one: my old wooden \\npipe. And here\\'s another: an unused one. I have carried it a long way,, \\nthough I don\\'t know why. I never really expected to find any pipe- weed on \\nthe journey, when my own ran out. But now it comes in useful after all.\\' He \\nheld up a small pipe with a wide flattened bowl, and handed it to Gimli. \\n\\'Does that settle the score between us?\\' he said. \\'Settle it!\\' cried Gimli. \\n\\n\\'Most noble hobbit, it leaves me deep in your debt.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, I am going back into the open air, to see what the wind and sky \\nare doing!\\' said Legolas. \\n\\n\\'We will come with you,\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\nThey went out and seated themselves upon the piled stones before the \\ngateway. They could see far down into the valley now; the mists were lifting \\nand floating away upon the breeze. \\n\\n\\'Now let us take our ease here for a little!\\' said Aragorn. \\'We will \\nsit on the edge of ruin and talk, as Gandalf says, while he is busy \\nelsewhere. I feel a weariness such as I have seldom felt before.\\' He wrapped \\nhis grey cloak about him, hiding his mail-shirt, and stretched out his long \\nlegs. Then he lay back and sent from his lips a thin stream of smoke. \\n\\n\\'Look!\\' said Pippin. \\'Strider the Ranger has come back!\\' \\n\\n\\'He has never been away,\\' said Aragorn. \\'I am Strider and D(r)nadan too, \\nand I belong both to Gondor and the North.\\' \\n\\nThey smoked in silence for a while, and the sun shone on them; slanting \\ninto the valley from among white clouds high in the West. Legolas lay still, \\nlooking up at the sun and sky with steady eyes, and singing softly to \\nhimself. At last he sat up. \\'Come now!\\' he said. \\'Time wears on, and the \\nmists are blowing away, or would if you strange folk did not wreathe \\nyourselves in smoke. What of the tale?\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, my tale begins with waking up in the dark and finding myself all \\nstrung-up in an ore-camp,\\' said Pippin. \\'Let me see, what is today?\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'The fifth of March in the Shire-reckoning,\\' said Aragorn. Pippin made \\nsome calculations on his fingers. \\'Only nine days ago!\\' he said.l \\'It seems \\na year since we were caught. Well, though half of it was like a bad dream, I \\nreckon that three very horrible days followed. Merry will correct me, if I \\nforget anything important: I am not going into details: the whips and the \\nfilth and stench and all that; it does not bear remembering.\\' With that he \\nplunged into an account of Boromir\\'s last fight and the ore-march from Emyn \\nMuil to the Forest. The others nodded as the various points were fitted in \\nwith their guesses. \\n\\n\\'Here are some treasures that you let fall,\\' said Aragorn. \\'You will be \\nglad to have them back.\\' He loosened his belt from under his cloak and took \\nfrom it the two sheathed knives. \\n\\n\\'Well!\\' said Merry. \\'I never expected to see those again! I marked a \\nfew ores with mine; but Ugl(r)k took them from us. How he glared! At first I \\nthought he was going to stab me, but he threw the things away as if they \\nburned him.\\' \\n\\n\\'And here also is your brooch, Pippin,\\' said Aragorn. \\'I have kept it \\nsafe, for it is a very precious thing.\\' \\n\\n\\'I know,\\' said Pippin. \\'It was a wrench to let it go; but what else \\ncould I do?\\' \\n\\n\\'Nothing else,\\' answered Aragorn. \\'One who cannot cast away a treasure \\nat need is in fetters. You did rightly.\\' \\n\\n\\'The cutting of the bands on your wrists, that was smart work!\\' said \\nGimli. \\'Luck served you there; but you seized your chance with both hands, \\none might say.\\' \\n\\n\\'And set us a pretty riddle,\\' said Legolas. \\'I wondered if you had \\ngrown wings!\\' \\n\\n\\'Unfortunately not,\\' said Pippin. \\'But you did not know about \\nGrishnbkh.\\' He shuddered and said no more, leaving Merry to tell of those \\nlast horrible moments: the pawing hands, the hot breath, and the dreadful \\nstrength of Grishnbkh\\'s hairy arms. \\n\\n\\'All this about the Ores of Barad-dyr, Lugb(r)rz as they call it, makes \\nme uneasy,\\' said Aragorn. \\'The Dark Lord already knew too much and his \\nservants also; and Grishnbkh evidently sent some message across the River \\nafter the quarrel. The Red Eye will be looking towards Isengard. But Saruman \\nat any rate is in a cleft stick of his own cutting.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, whichever side wins, his outlook is poor,\\' said Merry. \\'Things \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbegan to go all wrong for him from the moment his Ores set foot in Rohan.\\' \\n\\n\\'We caught a glimpse of the old villain, or so Gandalf hints,\\' said \\nGimli. \\'On the edge of the Forest.\\' \\n\\n\\'When was that?\\' asked Pippin. \\n\\n\\'Five nights ago,\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\n\\'Let me see,\\' said Merry: \\'five nights ago-now we come to a part of the \\nstory you know nothing about. We met Treebeard that morning after the \\nbattle; and that night we were at Wellinghall, one of his ent-houses. The \\nnext morning we went to Entmoot, a gathering of Ents, that is, and the \\nqueerest thing I have ever seen in my life. It lasted all that day and the \\nnext; and we spent the nights with an Ent called Quickbeam. And then late in \\nthe afternoon in the third day of their moot, the Ents suddenly blew up. It \\nwas amazing. The Forest had felt as tense as if a thunderstorm was brewing \\ninside it: then all at once it exploded. I wish you could have heard their \\nsong as they marched.\\' \\n\\n\\'If Saruman had heard it, he would be a hundred miles away by now, even \\nif he had had to run on his own legs,\\' said Pippin. \\n\\n\\'Though Isengard be strong and hard, as cold as stone and bare as bone, \\n\\nWe go, we go, we go to war, to hew the stone and break the door! \\n\\nThere was very much more. A great deal of the song had no words, and \\nwas like a music of horns and drums. It was very exciting. But I thought it \\nwas only marching music and no more, just a song -- until I got here. I know \\nbetter now.\\' \\n\\n\\'We came down over the last ridge into Nan Curunnr, after night had \\nfallen,\\' Merry continued. \\'It was then that I first had the feeling that the \\nForest itself was moving behind us. I thought I was dreaming an entish \\ndream, but Pippin had noticed it too. We were both frightened; but we did \\nnot find out more about it until later. \\n\\n\\'It was the Huorns, or so the Ents call them in \"short language\". \\nTreebeard won\\'t say much about them, but I think they are Ents that have \\nbecome almost like trees, at least to look at. They stand here and there in \\nthe wood or under its eaves, silent, watching endlessly over the trees; but \\ndeep in the darkest dales there are hundreds and hundreds of them, I \\nbelieve. \\n\\n\\'There is a great power in them, and they seem able to wrap themselves \\nin shadow: it is difficult to see them moving. But they do. They can move \\nvery quickly, if they are angry. You stand still looking at the weather, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmaybe, or listening to the rustling of the wind, and then suddenly you find \\nthat you are in the middle of a wood with great groping trees all around \\nyou. They still have voices, and can speak with the Ents -- that is why they \\nare called Huorns, Treebeard says -- but they have become queer and wild. \\nDangerous. I should be terrified of meeting them, if there were no true Ents \\nabout to look after them. \\n\\n\\'Well, in the early night we crept down a long ravine into the upper \\nend of the Wizard\\'s Vale, the Ents with all their rustling Huorns behind. We \\ncould not see them, of course, but the whole air was full of creaking. It \\nwas very dark, a cloudy night. They moved at a great speed as soon as they \\nhad left the hills, and made a noise like a rushing wind. The Moon did not \\nappear through the clouds, and not long after midnight there was a tall wood \\nall round the north side of Isengard. There was no sign of enemies nor of \\nany challenge. There was a light gleaming from a high window in the tower, \\nthat was all. \\n\\n\\'Treebeard and a few more Ents crept on, right round to within sight of \\nthe great gates. Pippin and I were with him. We were sitting on Treebeard\\'s \\nshoulders, and I could feel the quivering tenseness in him. But even when \\nthey are roused, Ents can be very cautious and patient. They stood still as \\ncarved stones, breathing and listening. \\n\\n\\'Then all at once there was a tremendous stir. Trumpets blared and the \\nwalls of Isengard echoed. We thought that we had been discovered, and that \\nbattle was going to begin. But nothing of the sort. All Saruman\\'s people \\nwere marching away. I don\\'t know much about this war, or about the \\nHorsemen \\n\\nof Rohan, but Saruman seems to have meant to finish off the king and all his \\nmen with one final blow. He emptied Isengard. I saw the enemy go: endless \\nlines of marching Ores; and troops of them mounted on great wolves. And \\nthere were battalions of Men, too. Many of them carried torches, and in the \\nflare I could see their faces. Most of them were ordinary men, rather tall \\nand dark-haired, and grim but not particularly evil -looking. But there were \\nsome others that were horrible: man-high, but with goblin-faces, sallow, \\nleering, squint-eyed. Do you know, they reminded me at once of that \\nSoutherner at Bree: only he was not so obviously ore-like as most of these \\nwere.\\' \\n\\n\\'I thought of him too,\\' said Aragorn. \\'We had many of these half-ores \\nto deal with at Helm\\'s Deep. It seems plain now that that Southerner was a \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nspy of Saruman\\'s; but whether he was working with the Black Riders, or for \\nSaruman alone, I do not know. It is difficult with these evil folk to know \\nwhen they are in league, and when they are cheating one another.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, of all sorts together, there must have been ten thousand at the \\nvery least,\\' said Merry. \\'They took an hour to pass out of the gates. Some \\nwent off down the highway to the Fords, and some turned away p and went \\neastward. A bridge has been built down there, about a mile away, where the \\nriver runs in a very deep channel. You could see it now, if you stood up. \\n\\nThey were all singing with harsh voices, and laughing, making a hideous din. \\n\\nI thought things looked very black for Rohan. But Treebeard did not move. He \\nsaid: \\'My business is with Isengard tonight, with rock and stone.\\' \\n\\n\\'But, though I could not see what was happening in the dark, I believe \\nthat Huorns began to move south, as soon as the gates were shut again. Their \\nbusiness was with Ores I think. They were far down the valley in the \\nmorning; or any rate there was a shadow there that one couldn\\'t see through. \\n\\n\\'As soon as Saruman had sent off all his army, our turn came. Treebeard \\nput us down, and went up to the gates, and began hammering on the doors, and \\ncalling for Saruman. There was no answer, except arrows and stones from the \\nwalls. But arrows are no use against Ents. They hurt them, of course, and \\ninfuriate them: like stinging flies. But an Ent can be stuck as full of \\nore-arrows as a pin-cushion, and take no serious harm. They cannot be \\npoisoned, for one thing; and their skin seems to be very thick, and tougher \\nthan bark. It takes a very heavy axe-stroke to wound them seriously. They \\ndon\\'t like axes. But there would have to be a great many axe -men to one Ent: \\na man that hacks once at an Ent never gets a chance of a second blow. A \\npunch from an Ent-fist crumples up iron like thin tin. \\n\\n\\'When Treebeard had got a few arrows in him, he began to warm up, to \\nget positively \"hasty\", as he would say. He let out a great hoom-hom, and a \\ndozen more Ents came striding up. An angry Ent is terrifying. Their fingers, \\nand their toes, just freeze on to rock; and they tear it up like \\nbread-crust. It was like watching the work of great tree-roots in a hundred \\nyears, all packed into a few moments. \\n\\n\\'They pushed, pulled, tore, shook, and hammered; and clang-bang, \\ncrash-crack, in five minutes they had these huge gates just lying in ruin; \\nand some were already beginning to eat into the walls, like rabbits in a \\nsand-pit. I don\\'t know what Saruman thought was happening; but anyway he \\ndid \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnot know how to deal with it. His wizardry may have been falling off lately, \\nof course; but anyway I think he has not much grit, not much plain courage \\nalone in a tight place without a lot of slaves and machines and things, if \\nyou know what I mean. Very different from old Gandalf. I wonder if his fame \\nwas not all along mainly due to his cleverness in settling at Isengard.\\' \\n\\n\\'No,\\' said Aragorn. \\'Once he was as great as his fame made him. His \\nknowledge was deep, his thought was subtle, and his hands marvellously \\nskilled; and he had a power over the minds of others. The wise he could \\npersuade, and the smaller folk he could daunt. That power he certainly still \\nkeeps. There are not many in Middle-earth that I should say were safe, if \\nthey were left alone to talk with him, even now when he has suffered a \\ndefeat. Gandalf, Elrond, and Galadriel, perhaps, now that his wickedness has \\nbeen laid bare, but very few others.\\' \\n\\n\\'The Ents are safe,\\' said Pippin. \\'He seems at one time to have got \\nround them, but never again. And anyway he did not understand them; and he \\nmade the great mistake of leaving them out of his calculations. He had no \\nplan for them, and there was no time to make any, once they had set to work. \\nAs soon as our attack began, the few remaining rats in Isengard started \\nbolting through every hole that the Ents made. The Ents let the Men go, \\nafter they had questioned them, two or three dozen only down at this end. I \\ndon\\'t think many ore-folk, of any size, escaped. Not from the Huorns: there \\nwas a wood full of them all round Isengard by that time, as well as those \\nthat had gone down the valley. \\n\\n\\'When the Ents had reduced a large part of the southern walls to \\nrubbish, and what was left of his people had bolted and deserted him, \\nSaruman fled in a panic. He seems to have been at the gates when we arrived: \\n\\nI expect he came to watch his splendid army march out. When the Ents broke \\ntheir way in, he left in a hurry. They did not spot him at first. But the \\nnight had opened out, and there was a great light of stars, quite enough for \\nEnts to see by, and suddenly Quickbeam gave a cry \"The tree-killer, the \\ntree-killer!\" Quickbeam is a gentle creature, but he hates Saruman all the \\nmore fiercely for that: his people suffered cruelly from ore-axes. He leapt \\ndown the path from the inner gate, and he can move like a wind when he is \\nroused. There was a pale figure hurrying away in and out of the shadows of \\nthe pillars, and it had nearly reached the stairs to the tower-door. But it \\nwas a near thing. Quickbeam was so hot after him, that he was within a step \\nor two of being caught and strangled when he slipped in through the door. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'When Saruman was safe back in Orthanc, it was not long before he set \\nsome of his precious machinery to work. By that time there were many Ents \\ninside Isengard: some had followed Quickbeam, and others had burst in from \\nthe north and east; they were roaming about and doing a great deal of \\ndamage. Suddenly up came fires and foul fumes: the vents and shafts all over \\nthe plain began to spout and belch. Several of the Ents got scorched and \\nblistered. One of them, Beechbone I think he was called, a very tall \\nhandsome Ent, got caught in a spray of some liquid fire and burned like a \\ntorch: a horrible sight. \\n\\n\\'That sent them mad. I thought that they had been really roused before; \\nbut I was wrong. I saw what it was like at last. It was staggering. They \\nroared and boomed and trumpeted, until stones began to crack and fall at the \\nmere noise of them. Merry and I lay on the ground and stuffed our cloaks \\ninto our ears. Round and round the rock of Orthanc the Ents went striding \\nand storming like a howling gale, breaking pillars, hurling avalanches of \\nboulders down the shafts, tossing up huge slabs of stone into the air like \\nleaves. The tower was in the middle of a spinning whirlwind. I saw iron \\nposts and blocks of masonry go rocketing up hundreds of feet, and smash \\nagainst the windows of Orthanc. But Treebeard kept his head. lie had not had \\nany burns, luckily. He did not want his folk to hurt themselves in their \\nfury, and he did not want Saruman to escape out of some hole in the \\nconfusion. Many of the Ents were hurling themselves against the \\nOrthanc -rock; but that defeated them. It is very smooth and hard. Some \\nwizardry is in it, perhaps, older and stronger than Saruman\\'s. Anyway they \\ncould not get a grip on it, or make a crack in it; and they were bruising \\nand wounding themselves against it. \\'So Treebeard went out into the ring and \\nshouted. His enormous voice rose above all the din. There was a dead \\nsilence, suddenly. In it we heard a shrill laugh from a high window in the \\ntower. That had a queer effect on the Ents. They had been boiling over; now \\nthey became cold, grim as ice, and quiet. They left the plain and gathered \\nround Treebeard, standing quite still. He spoke to them for a little in \\ntheir own language; I think he was telling them of a plan he had made in his \\nold head long before. Then they just faded silently away in the grey light. \\n\\nDay was dawning by that time. \\n\\n\\'They set a watch on the tower, I believe, but the watchers were so \\nwell hidden in shadows and kept so still, that I could not see them. The \\nothers went away north. All that day they were busy, out of sight. Most of \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe time we were left alone. It was a dreary day; and we wandered about a \\nbit, though we kept out of the view of the windows of Orthanc, as much as we \\ncould: they stared at us so threateningly. A good deal of the time we spent \\nlooking for something to eat. And also we sat and talked, wondering what was \\nhappening away south in Rohan, and what had become of all the rest of our \\nCompany. Every now and then we could hear in the distance the rattle and \\nfall of stone, and thudding noises echoing in the hills. \\n\\n\\'In the afternoon we walked round the circle, and went to have a look \\nat what was going on. There was a great shadowy wood of Huorns at the head \\nof the valley, and another round the northern wall. We did not dare to go \\nin. But there was a rending, tearing noise of work going on inside. Ents and \\nHuorns were digging great pits and trenches, and making great pools and \\ndams, gathering all the waters of the Isen and every other spring and stream \\nthat they could find. We left them to it. \\n\\n\\'At dusk Treebeard came back to the gate. He was humming and booming to \\nhimself, and seemed pleased. He stood and stretched his great arms and legs \\nand breathed deep. I asked him if he was tired. \\n\\n\\' \"Tired?\" he said, \"tired? Well no, not tired, but stiff. I need a \\ngood draught of Entwash. We have worked hard; we have done more \\nstone -cracking and earth-gnawing today than we have done in many a long \\nyear \\n\\nbefore. But it is nearly finished. When night falls do not linger near this \\ngate or in the old tunnel! Water may come through-and it will be foul water \\nfor a while, until all the filth of Saruman is washed away. Then Isen can \\nrun clean again.\" He began to pull down a bit more of the walls, in a \\nleisurely sort of way, just to amuse himself. \\n\\n\\'We were just wondering where it would be safe to lie and get some \\nsleep, when the most amazing thing of all happened. There was the sound of a \\nrider coming swiftly up the road. Merry and I lay quiet, and Treebeard hid \\nhimself in the shadows under the arch. Suddenly a great horse came striding \\nup, like a flash of silver. It was already dark, but I could see the rider\\'s \\nface clearly: it seemed to shine, and all his clothes were white. I just sat \\nup, staring, with my mouth open. I tried to call out, and couldn\\'t. \\n\\n\\'There was no need. He halted just by us and looked down at us. \\n\\'Gandalf!\\' I said at last, but my voice was only a whisper. Did he say: \\n\\n\"Hullo, Pippin! This is a pleasant surprise!\"? No, indeed! He said: \"Get up, \\nyou tom-fool of a Took! Where, in the name of wonder, in all this ruin is \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTreebeard? I want him. Quick!\" \\n\\n\\'Treebeard heard his voice and came out of the shadows at once; and \\nthere was a strange meeting. I was surprised, because neither of them seemed \\nsurprised at all. Gandalf obviously expected to find Treebeard here; and \\nTreebeard might almost have been loitering about near the gates on purpose \\nto meet him. Yet we had told the old Entail about Moria. But then I \\nremembered a queer look he gave us at the time. I can only suppose that he \\nhad seen Gandalf or had some news of him, but would not say anything in a \\nhurry. \"Don\\'t be hasty\" is his motto; but nobody, not even Elves, will say \\nmuch about Gandalf s movements when he is not there. \\n\\n\\'\"Hoorn! Gandalf!\" said Treebeard. \"I am glad you have come. Wood and \\nwater, stock and stone, I can master; but there is a Wizard to manage here.\" \\n\\n\\'\"Treebeard,\" said Gandalf. \"I need your help. You have done much, but \\nI need more. I have about ten thousand Ores to manage.\" \\n\\n\\'Then those two went off and had a council together in some corner. It \\nmust have seemed very hasty to Treebeard, for Gandalf was in a tremendous \\nhurry, and was already talking at a great pace, before they passed out of \\nhearing. They were only away a matter of minutes, perhaps a quarter of an \\nhour. Then Gandalf came back to us, and he seemed relieved, almost merry. He \\ndid say he was glad to see us, then. \\n\\n\"\\'But Gandalf,\" I cried, \"where have you been? And have you seen the \\nothers?\" \\n\\n\"\\'Wherever I have been, I am back,\" he answered in the genuine Gandalf \\nmanner. \"Yes, I have seen some of the others. But news must wait. This is a \\nperilous night, and I must ride fast. But the dawn may be brighter; and if \\nso, we shall meet again. Take care of yourselves, and keep away from \\nOrthanc! Good-bye!\" \\n\\n\\'Treebeard was very thoughtful after Gandalf had gone. He had evidently \\nlearnt a lot in a short time and was digesting it. He looked at us and said: \\n\\n\"Hm, well, I find you are not such hasty folk as I thought. You said much \\nless than you might, and not more than you should. Hm, this is a bundle of \\nnews and no mistake! Well, now Treebeard must get busy again.\" \\n\\n\\'Before he went, we got a little news out of him; and it did not cheer \\nus up at all. But for the moment we thought more about you three than about \\nFrodo and Sam, or about poor Boromir. For we gathered that there was a great \\nbattle going on, or soon would be, and that you were in it, and might never \\ncome out of it. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'\"Huorns will help,\" said Treebeard. Then he went away and we did not \\nsee him again until this morning. \\n\\n\\'It was deep night. We lay on top of a pile of stone, and could see \\nnothing beyond it. Mist or shadows blotted out everything like a great \\nblanket all round us. The air seemed hot and heavy; and it was full of \\nrustlings, creakings, and a murmur like voices passing. I think that \\nhundreds more of the Huorns must have been passing by to help in the battle. \\nLater there was a great rumble of thunder away south, and flashes of \\nlightning far away across Rohan. Every now and then we could see \\nmountain-peaks, miles and miles away, stab out suddenly, black and white, \\nand then vanish. And behind us there were noises like thunder in hills, but \\ndifferent. At times the whole valley echoed. \\n\\n\\'It must have been about midnight when the Ents broke the dams and \\npoured all the gathered waters through a gap in the northern wall, down into \\nIsengard. The Huorn-dark had passed, and the thunder had rolled away. The \\nMoon was sinking behind the western mountains. \\n\\n\\'Isengard began to fill up with black creeping streams and pools. They \\nglittered in the last light of the Moon, as they spread over the plain. \\n\\nEvery now and then the waters found their way down into some shaft or \\nspouthole. Great white steams hissed up. Smoke rose in billows. There were \\nexplosions and gusts of fire. One great coil of vapour went whirling up, \\ntwisting round and round Orthanc, until it looked like a tall peak of cloud, \\nfiery underneath and moonlit above. And still more water poured in, until at \\nlast Isengard looked like a huge flat saucepan, all steaming and bubbling.\\' \\n\\n\\'We saw a cloud of smoke and steam from the south last night when we \\ncame to the mouth of Nan Curunnr,\\' said Aragorn. \\'We feared that Saruman \\nwas \\n\\nbrewing some new devilry for us.\\' \\n\\n\\'Not he!\\' said Pippin. \\'He was probably choking and not laughing any \\nmore. By the morning, yesterday morning, the water had sunk down into all \\nthe holes, and there was a dense fog. We took refuge in that guardroom over \\nthere; and we had rather a fright. The lake began to overflow and pour out \\nthrough the old tunnel, and the water was rapidly rising up the steps. We \\nthought we were going to get caught like Ores in a hole; but we found a \\nwinding stair at the back of the store-room that brought us out on top of \\nthe arch. It was a squeeze to get out, as the passages had been cracked and \\nhalf blocked with fallen stone near the top. There we sat high up above the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfloods and watched the drowning of Isengard. The Ents kept on pouring in \\nmore water, till all the fires were quenched and every cave filled. The fogs \\nslowly gathered together and steamed up into a huge umbrella of cloud: it \\nmust have been a mile high. In the evening there was a great rainbow over \\nthe eastern hills; and then the sunset was blotted out by a thick drizzle on \\nthe mountain-sides. It all went very quiet. A few wolves howled mournfully, \\nfar away. The Ents stopped the inflow in the night, and sent the Isen back \\ninto its old course. And that was the end of it all. \\n\\n\\'Since then the water has been sinking again. There must be outlets \\nsomewhere from the caves underneath, I think. If Saruman peeps out of any of \\nhis windows, it must look an untidy, dreary mess. We felt very lonely. Not \\neven a visible Ent to talk to in all the ruin; and no news. We spent the \\nnight up on top there above the arch, and it was cold and damp and we did \\nnot sleep. We had a feeling that anything might happen at any minute. \\nSaruman is still in his tower. There was a noise in the night like a wind \\ncoming up the valley. I think the Ents and Huorns that had been away came \\nback then; but where they have all gone to now, I don\\'t know. It was a \\nmisty, moisty morning when we climbed down and looked round again, \\nand \\n\\nnobody was about. And that is about all there is to tell. It seems almost \\npeaceful now after all the turmoil. And safer too, somehow, since Gandalf \\ncame back. I could sleep!\\' \\n\\nThey all fell silent for a while. Gimli re-filled his pipe. \\'There is \\none thing I wonder about,\\' he said as he lit it with his flint and tinder: \\n\\'Wormtongue. You told Thjoden he was with Saruman. How did he get there?\\' \\n\\n\\'Oh yes, I forgot about him,\\' said Pippin. \\'He did not get here till \\nthis morning. We had just lit the fire and had some breakfast when Treebeard \\nappeared again. We heard him hooming and calling our names outside. \\n\\n\"\\'I have just come round to see how you are faring, my lads,\\' he said; \\n\\n\\'and to give you some news. Huorns have come back. All\\'s well; aye very well \\nindeed!\" he laughed, and slapped his thighs. \"No more Ores in Isengard, no \\nmore axes! And there will be folk coming up from the South before the day is \\nold; some that you may be glad to see.\" \\n\\n\\'He had hardly said that, when we heard the sound of hoofs on the road. \\n\\nWe rushed out before the gates, and I stood and stared, half expecting to \\nsee Strider and Gandalf come riding up at the head of an army. But out of \\nthe mist there rode a man on an old tired horse; and he looked a queer \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntwisted sort of creature himself. There was no one else. When he came, out \\nof the mist and suddenly saw all the ruin and wreckage in front of him, he \\nsat and gaped, and his face went almost green. He was so bewildered that he \\ndid not seem to notice us at first. When he did, he gave a cry, and tried to \\nturn his horse round and ride off. But Treebeard took three strides, put out \\na long arm, and lifted him out of the saddle. His horse bolted in terror, \\nand he grovelled on the ground. He said he was Grnma, friend and counsellor \\nof the king, and had been sent with important messages from Thjoden to \\nSaruman. \\n\\n\\'\"No one else would dare to ride through the open land, so full of foul \\nOres,\" he said, \"so I was sent. And I have had a perilous journey, and I am \\nhungry and weary. I fled far north out of my way, pursued by wolves.\" \\n\\n\\'I caught the sidelong looks he gave to Treebeard, and I said to myself \\n\"liar\". Treebeard looked at him in his long slow way for several minutes, \\ntill the wretched man was squirming on the floor. Then at last he said: \"Ha, \\nhm, I was expecting you, Master Wormtongue.\" The man started at that name. \\n\"Gandalf got here first. So I know as much about you as I need, and I know \\nwhat to do with you. Put all the rats in one trap, said Gandalf; and I will. \\n\\nI am the master of Isengard now, but Saruman is locked in his tower; and you \\ncan go there and give him all the messages that you can think of.\" \\n\\n\\'\"Let me go, let me go!\" said Wormtongue. \"I know the way.\" \\n\\n\"\\'You knew the way, I don\\'t doubt,\" said Treebeard. \"But things have \\nchanged here a little. Go and see!\" \\n\\n\\'He let Wormtongue go, and he limped off through the arch with us close \\nbehind, until he came inside the ring and could see all the floods that lay \\nbetween him and Orthanc. Then he turned to us. \\n\\n\"\\'Let me go away!\" he whined. \"Let me go away! My messages are useless \\nnow.\" \\n\\n\"\\'They are indeed,\" said Treebeard. \"But you have only two choices: to \\nstay with me until Gandalf and your master arrive; or to cross the water. \\nWhich will you have?\" \\n\\n\\'The man shivered at the mention of his master, and put a foot into the \\nwater; but he drew back. \"I cannot swim,\" he said. \\n\\n\"\\'The water is not deep,\" said Treebeard. \"It is dirty, but that will \\nnot harm you, Master Wormtongue. In you go now!\" \\n\\n\\'With that the wretch floundered off into the flood. It rose up nearly \\nto his neck before he got too far away for me to see him. The last I saw of \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhim was clinging to some old barrel or piece of wood. But Treebeard waded \\nafter him, and watched his progress. \\n\\n\\'\"Well, he has gone in,\" he said when he returned. \"I saw him crawling \\nup the steps like a draggled rat. There is someone in the tower still: a \\nhand came out and pulled him in. So there he is, and I hope the welcome is \\nto his liking. Now I must go and wash myself clean of the slime. I\\'ll be \\naway up on the north side, if anyone wants to see me. There is no clean \\nwater down here fit for an Ent to drink, or to bathe in. So I will ask you \\ntwo lads to keep a watch at the gate for the folk that are coming. There\\'ll \\nbe the Lord of the Fields of Rohan, mark you! You must welcome him as well \\nas you know how: his men have fought a great fight with the Ores. Maybe, you \\nknow the right fashion of Men\\'s words for such a lord, better than Ents. \\n\\nThere have been many lords in the green fields in my time, and I have never \\nlearned their speech or their names. They will be wanting man-food, and you \\nknow all about that, I guess. So find what you think is fit for a king to \\neat, if you can.\" And that is the end of the story. Though I should like to \\nknow who this Wormtongue is. Was he really the king\\'s counsellor?\\' \\n\\n\\'He was,\\' said Aragorn; \\'and also Saruman\\'s spy and servant in Rohan. \\n\\nFate has not been kinder to him than he deserves. The sight of the ruin of \\nall that he thought so strong and magnificent must have been almost \\npunishment enough. But I fear that worse awaits him.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, I don\\'t suppose Treebeard sent him to Orthanc out of kindness,\\' \\nsaid Merry. \\'He seemed rather grimly delighted with the business and was \\nlaughing to himself when he went to get his bathe and drink. We spent a busy \\ntime after that, searching the flotsam, and rummaging about. We found two or \\nthree store-rooms in different places nearby, above the flood-level. But \\nTreebeard sent some Ents down, and they carried off a great deal of the \\nstuff. \\n\\n\"\\'We want man-food for twenty-five,\" the Ents said, so you can see that \\nsomebody had counted your company carefully before you arrived. You three \\nwere evidently meant to go with the great people. But you would not have \\nfared any better. We kept as good as we sent, I promise you. Better, because \\nwe sent no drink. \\n\\n\"\\'What about drink?\" I said to the Ents. \\n\\n\"\\'There is water of Isen,\" they said, \"and that is good enough for Ents \\nand Men.\" But I hope that the Ents may have found time to brew some of their \\ndraughts from the mountain-springs, and we shall see Gandalf\\'s beard curling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhen he returns. After the Ents had gone, we felt tired, and hungry. But we \\ndid not grumble -- our labours had been well rewarded. It was through our \\nsearch for man-food that Pippin discovered the prize of all the flotsam, \\nthose Hornblower barrels. \"Pipe-weed is better after food,\" said Pippin; \\nthat is how the situation arose.\\' \\n\\n\\'We understand it all perfectly now,\\' said Gimli. \\n\\n\\'All except one thing,\\' said Aragorn: \\'leaf from the Southfarthing in \\nIsengard. The more I consider it, the more curious I find it. I have never \\nbeen in Isengard, but I have journeyed in this land, and I know well the \\nempty countries that lie between Rohan and the Shire. Neither goods nor folk \\nhave passed that way for many a long year, not openly. Saruman had secret \\ndealings with someone in the Shire, I guess. Wormtongues may be found in \\nother houses than King Thjoden\\'s. Was there a date on the barrels?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Pippin. \\'It was the 1417 crop, that is last year\\'s; no, the \\nyear before, of course, now: a good year.\\' \\n\\n\\'Ah well, whatever evil was afoot is over now, I hope; or else it is \\nbeyond our reach at present,\\' said Aragorn. \\'Yet I think I shall mention it \\nto Gandalf, small matter though it may seem among his great affairs.\\' \\n\\n\\'I wonder what he is doing,\\' said Merry. \\'The afternoon is getting on. \\n\\nLet us go and look round! You can enter Isengard now at any rate, Strider, \\nif you want to. But it is not a very cheerful sight.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 10. The Voice of Saruman \\n\\n\\n\\nThey passed through the ruined tunnel and stood upon a heap of stones, \\ngazing at the dark rock of Orthanc, and its many windows, a menace still in \\nthe desolation that lay all about it. The waters had now nearly all \\nsubsided. Here and there gloomy pools remained, covered with scum and \\nwreckage; but most of the wide circle was bare again, a wilderness of slime \\nand tumbled rock, pitted with blackened holes, and dotted with posts and \\npillars leaning drunkenly this way and that. At the rim of the shattered \\nbowl there lay vast mounds and slopes, like the shingles cast up by a great \\nstorm; and beyond them the green and tangled valley ran up into the long \\nravine between the dark arms of the mountains. Across the waste they saw \\nriders picking their way; they were coming from the north side, and already \\nthey were drawing near to Orthanc. \\n\\nThere is Gandalf, and Thjoden and his men!\\' said Legolas. \\'Let us go \\nand meet them!\\' \\n\\n\\'Walk warily!\\' said Merry. \\'There are loose slabs that may tilt up and \\nthrow you down into a pit, if you don\\'t take care.\\' \\n\\nThey followed what was left of the road from the gates to Orthanc, \\ngoing slowly, for the flag-stones were cracked and slimed. The riders, \\nseeing them approach, halted under the shadow of the rock and waited for \\nthem. Gandalf rode forward to meet them. \\n\\n\\'Well, Treebeard and I have had some interesting discussions, and made \\na few plans,\\' he said; \\'and we have all had some much-needed rest. Now we \\nmust be going on again. I hope you companions have all rested, too, and \\nrefreshed yourselves?\\' \\n\\n\\'We have,\\' said Merry. \\'But our discussions began and ended in smoke. \\nStill we feel less ill-disposed towards Saruman than we did.\\' \\n\\n\\'Do you indeed?\\' said Gandalf. \\'Well, I do not. I have now a last task \\nto do before I go: I must pay Saruman a farewell visit. Dangerous, and \\nprobably useless; but it must be done. Those of you who wish may come with \\nme -- but beware! And do not jest! This is not the time for it.\\' \\n\\n\\'I will come,\\' said Gimli. \\'I wish to see him and learn if he really \\nlooks like you.\\' \\n\\n\\'And how will you learn that, Master Dwarf?\\' said Gandalf. \\'Saruman \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncould look like me in your eyes, if it suited his purpose with you. And are \\nyou yet wise enough to detect all his counterfeits? Well, we shall see, \\nperhaps. He may be shy of showing himself before many different eyes \\ntogether. But I have ordered all the Ents to remove themselves from sight, \\nso perhaps we shall persuade him to come out.\\' \\n\\n\\'What\\'s the danger?\\' asked Pippin. \\'Will he shoot at us, and pour fire \\nout of the windows; or can he put a spell on us from a distance?\\' \\n\\n\\'The last is most likely, if you ride to his door with a light heart,\\' \\nsaid Gandalf. \\'But there is no knowing what he can do, or may choose to try. \\n\\nA wild beast cornered is not safe to approach. And Saruman has powers you do \\nnot guess. Beware of his voice!\\' \\n\\nThey came now to the foot of Orthanc. It was black, and the rock \\ngleamed as if it were wet. The many faces of the stone had sharp edges as \\nthough they had been newly chiselled. A few scorings, and small flake-like \\nsplinters near the base, were all the marks that it bore of the fury of the \\nEnts. \\n\\nOn the eastern side, in the angle of two piers, there was a great door, \\nhigh above the ground; and over it was a shuttered window, opening upon a \\nbalcony hedged with iron bars. Up to the threshold of the door there mounted \\na flight of twenty-seven broad stairs, hewn by some unknown art of the same \\nblack stone. This was the only entrance to the tower; but many tall windows \\nwere cut with deep embrasures in the climbing walls: far up they peered like \\nlittle eyes in the sheer faces of the horns. \\n\\nAt the foot of the stairs Gandalf and the king dismounted. \\'I will go \\nup,\\' said Gandalf. \\'I have been in Orthanc and I know my peril.\\' \\n\\n\\'And I too will go up,\\' said the king. \\'I am old, and fear no peril any \\nmore. I wish to speak with the enemy who has done me so much wrong. \\nJomer \\n\\nshall come with me, and see that my aged feet do not falter.\\' \\n\\n\\'As you will,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Aragorn shall come with me. Let the \\nothers await us at the foot of the stairs. They will hear and see enough, if \\nthere is anything to hear or see.\\' \\n\\n\\'Nay!\\' said Gimli. \\'Legolas and I wish for a closer view. We alone here \\nrepresent our kindred. We also will come behind.\\' \\n\\n\\'Come then!\\' said Gandalf, and with that he climbed the steps, and \\nThjoden went beside him. \\n\\nThe Riders of Rohan sat uneasily upon their horses, on either side of \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe stair, and looked up darkly at the great tower, fearing what might \\nbefall their lord. Merry and Pippin sat on the bottom step, feeling both \\nunimportant and unsafe. \\n\\n\\'Half a sticky mile from here to the gate!\\' muttered Pippin. \\'I wish I \\ncould slip off back to the guardroom unnoticed! What did we come for? We are \\nnot wanted.\\' \\n\\nGandalf stood before the door of Orthanc and beat on it with his staff. \\n\\nIt rang with a hollow sound. \\'Saruman, Saruman!\\' he cried in a loud \\ncommanding voice. \\'Saruman come forth!\\' \\n\\nFor some time there was no answer. At last the window above the door \\nwas unbarred, hut no figure could be seen at its dark opening. \\n\\n\\'Who is it?\\' said a voice. \\'What do you wish?\\' \\n\\nThjoden started. \\'I know that voice,\\' he said, \\'and I curse the day \\nwhen I first listened to it.\\' \\n\\n\\'Go and fetch Saruman, since you have become his footman, Grnma \\nWormtongue!\\' said Gandalf. \\'And do not waste our time!\\' \\n\\nThe window closed. They waited. Suddenly another voice spoke, low and \\nmelodious, its very sound an enchantment. Those who listened unwarily to \\nthat voice could seldom report the words that they heard; and if they did, \\nthey wondered, for little power remained in them. Mostly they remembered \\nonly that it was a delight to hear the voice speaking, all that it said \\nseemed wise and reasonable, and desire awoke in them by swift agreement to \\nseem wise themselves. When others spoke they seemed harsh and uncouth \\nby \\n\\ncontrast; and if they gainsaid the voice, anger was kindled in the hearts of \\nthose under the spell. Fur some the spell lasted only while the voice spoke \\nto them, and when it spake to another they smiled, as men do who see through \\na juggler\\'s trick while others gape at it. For many the sound of the voice \\nalone was enough to hold them enthralled; but for those whom it conquered \\nthe spell endured when they were far away, and ever they heard that soft \\nvoice whispering and urging them. But none were unmoved; none rejected its \\npleas and its commands without an effort of mind and will, so long as its \\nmaster had control of it. \\n\\n\\'Well?\\' it said now with gentle question. \\'Why must you disturb my \\nrest? Will you give me no peace at all by night or day?\\' Its tone was that \\nof a kindly heart aggrieved by injuries undeserved. \\n\\nThey looked up, astonished, for they had heard no sound of his coming; \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand they saw a figure standing at the rail, looking down upon them: an old \\nman, swathed in a great cloak, the colour of which was not easy to tell, for \\nit changed if they moved their eyes or if he stirred. His face was long, \\nwith a high forehead, he had deep darkling eyes, hard to fathom, though the \\nlook that they now bore was grave and benevolent, and a little weary. His \\nhair and beard were white, but strands of black still showed about his lips \\nand ears. \\n\\n\\'Like, and yet unlike,\\' muttered Gimli. \\n\\n\\'But come now,\\' said the soft voice. \\'Two at least of you I know by \\nname. Gandalf I know too well to have much hope that he seeks help or \\ncounsel here. But you, Thjoden Lord of the Mark of Rohan are declared by \\nyour noble devices, and still more by the fair countenance of the House of \\nEorl. O worthy son of Thengel the Thrice-renowned! Why have you not \\ncome \\n\\nbefore, and as a friend? Much have I desired to see you, mightiest king of \\nwestern lands, and especially in these latter years, to save you from the \\nunwise and evil counsels that beset you ! Is it yet too late? Despite the \\ninjuries that have been done to me, in which the men of Rohan, alas! have \\nhad some part, still I would save you, and deliver you from the ruin that \\ndraws nigh inevitably, if you ride upon this road which you have taken. \\nIndeed I alone can aid you now.\\' \\n\\nThjoden opened his mouth as if to speak, but he said nothing. He looked \\nup at the face of Saruman with its dark solemn eyes bent down upon him, and \\nthen to Gandalf at his side; and he seemed to hesitate. Gandalf made no \\nsign; but stood silent as stone, as one waiting patiently for some call that \\nhas not yet come. The Riders stirred at first, murmuring with approval of \\nthe words of Saruman; and then they too were silent, as men spell-bound. It \\nseemed to them that Gandalf had never spoken so fair and fittingly to their \\nlord. Rough and proud now seemed all his dealings with Thjoden. And over \\ntheir hearts crept a shadow, the fear of a great danger: the end of the Mark \\nin a darkness to which Gandalf was driving them, while Saruman stood beside \\na door of escape, holding it half open so that a ray of light came through. \\nThere was a heavy silence. \\n\\nIt was Gimli the dwarf who broke in suddenly. \\'The words of this wizard \\nstand on their heads,\\' he growled, gripping the handle of his axe. \\'In the \\nlanguage of Orthanc help means ruin, and saving means slaying, that is \\nplain. But we do not come here to beg.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Peace!\\' said Saruman, and for a fleeting moment his voice was less \\nsuave, and a light flickered in his eyes and was gone. \\'I do not speak to \\nyou yet, Gimli Gluin\\'s son,\\' he said. \\'Far away is your home and small \\nconcern of yours are the troubles of this land. But it was not by design of \\nyour own that you became embroiled in them, and so I will not blame such \\npart as you have played-a valiant one, I doubt not. But I pray you, allow me \\nfirst to speak with the King of Rohan, my neighbour, and once my friend. \\n\\n\\'What have you to say, Thjoden King? Will you have peace with me, and \\nall the aid that my knowledge, founded in long years, can bring? Shall we \\nmake our counsels together against evil days, and repair our injuries with \\nsuch good will that our estates shall both come to fairer flower than ever \\nbefore?\\' \\n\\nStill Thjoden did not answer. Whether he strove with anger or doubt \\nnone could say. Jomer spoke. \\n\\n\\'Lord, hear me!\\' he said. \\'Now we feel the peril that we were warned \\nof. Have we ridden forth to victory, only to stand at last amazed by an old \\nliar with honey on his forked tongue? So would the trapped wolf speak to the \\nhounds, if he could. What aid can he give to you, forsooth? All he desires \\nis to escape from his plight. But will you parley with this dealer in \\ntreachery and murder? Remember Thjodred at the Fords, and the grave of \\nHbma \\n\\nin Helm\\'s Deep!\\' \\n\\n\\'If we speak of poisoned tongues what shall we say of yours, young \\nserpent?\\' said Saruman, and the flash of his anger was now plain to see. \\n\\n\\'But come, Jomer, Jomund\\'s son!\\' he went on in his soft voice again. To \\nevery man h part. Valour in arms is yours, and you win high honour thereby. \\nSlay whom your lord names as enemies, and be content. Meddle not in policies \\nwhich you do not understand. But maybe, if you become a king, you Will find \\nthat he must choose his friends with care. The friendship of Saruman and the \\npower of Orthanc cannot be lightly thrown aside, whatever grievances, real \\nor fancied, may lie behind. You have won a battle but not a war and that \\nwith help on which you cannot count again. You may find the Shadow of the \\nWood at your own door next: it is wayward, and senseless, and has no love \\nfor Men. \\n\\n\\'But my lord of Rohan, am I to be called a murderer, because valiant \\nmen have fallen in battle? If you go to war, needlessly, for I did not \\ndesire it, then men will be slain. But if I am a murderer on that account, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthen all the House of Eorl is stained with murder; for they have fought many \\nwars, and assailed many who defied them. Yet with some they have afterwards \\nmade peace, none the worse for being politic. I say, Thjoden King: shall we \\nhave peace and friendship, you and I? It is ours to command \\' \\n\\n\\'We will have peace,\\' said Thjoden at last thickly and with an effort. \\n\\nSeveral of the Riders cried out gladly. Thjoden held up his hand. \\'Yes, we \\nwill have peace,\\' he said, now in a clear voice, \\'we will have peace, when \\nyou and all your works have perished -- and the works of your dark master to \\nwhom you would deliver us. You are a liar. Saruman, and a corrupter of men\\'s \\nhearts. You hold out your hand to me, and I perceive only a finger of the \\nclaw of Mordor. Cruel and cold! Even if your war on me was just as it was \\nnot, for were you ten times as wise you would have no right to rule me and \\nmine for your own profit as you desired -- even so, what will you say of \\nyour torches in Westfold and the children that lie dead there? And they \\nhewed Hbma\\'s body before the gates of the Hornburg, after he was dead. \\n\\nWhen \\n\\nyou hang from a gibbet at your window for the sport of your own crows, I \\nwill have peace with you and Orthanc. So much for the House of Eorl. A \\nlesser son of great sires am I, but I do not need to lick your fingers. Turn \\nelsewhither. But I fear your voice has lost its charm.\\' \\n\\nThe Riders gazed up at Thjoden like men startled out of a dream. Harsh \\nas an old raven\\'s their master\\'s voice sounded in their ears after the music \\nof Saruman. But Saruman for a while was beside himself with wrath. He leaned \\nover the rail as if he would smite the King with his staff. To some suddenly \\nit seemed that they saw a snake coiling itself to strike. \\n\\n\\'Gibbets and crows!\\' he hissed, and they shuddered at the hideous \\nchange. \\'Dotard! What is the house of Eorl but a thatched barn where \\nbrigands drink in the reek, and their brats roll on the floor among the \\ndogs? Too long have they escaped the gibbet themselves. But the noose comes, \\nslow in the drawing, tight and hard in the end. Hang if you will!\\' Now his \\nvoice changed, as he slowly mastered himself. \\'I know not why I have had the \\npatience to speak to you. For I need you not, nor your little band of \\ngallopers, as swift to fly as to advance, Thjoden Horsemaster. Long ago I \\noffered you a state beyond your merit and your wit. I have offered it again, \\nso that those whom you mislead may clearly see the choice of roads. You give \\nme brag and abuse. So be it. Go back to your huts! \\n\\n\\'But you, Gandalf ! For you at least I am grieved, feeling for your \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nshame. How comes it that you can endure such company? For you are proud, \\nGandalf-and not without reason, having a noble mind and eyes that look both \\ndeep and far. Even now will you not listen to my counsel?\\' \\n\\nGandalf stirred, and looked up. \\'What have you to say that you did not \\nsay at our last meeting?\\' he asked. \\'Or, perhaps, you have things to unsay?\\' \\n\\nSaruman paused. \\'Unsay?\\' he mused, as if puzzled. \\'Unsay? I endeavoured \\nto advise you for your own good, but you scarcely listened. You are proud \\nand do not love advice, having indeed a store of your own wisdom. But on \\nthat occasion you erred, I think, misconstruing my intentions wilfully. I \\nfear that in my eagerness to persuade you, I lost patience. And indeed I \\nregret it. For I bore you no ill-will; and even now I bear none, though you \\nreturn to me in the company of the violent and the ignorant. How should I? \\nAre we not both members of a high and ancient order, most excellent in \\nMiddle-earth? Our friendship would profit us both alike. Much we could still \\naccomplish together, to heal the disorders of the world. Let us understand \\none another, and dismiss from thought these lesser folk! Let them wait on \\nour decisions ! For the common good I am willing to redress the past, and to \\nreceive you. Will you not consult with me? Will you not come up?\\' \\n\\nSo great was the power that Saruman exerted in this last effort that \\nnone that stood within hearing were unmoved. But now the spell was wholly \\ndifferent. They heard the gentle remonstrance of a kindly king with an \\nerring but much-loved minister. But they were shut out, listening at a door \\nto words not meant for them: ill-mannered children or stupid servants \\noverhearing the elusive discourse of their elders, and wondering how it \\nwould affect their lot. Of loftier mould these two were made: reverend and \\nwise. It was inevitable that they should make alliance. Gandalf would ascend \\ninto the tower, to discuss deep things beyond their comprehension in the \\nhigh chambers of Orthanc. The door would be closed, and they would be left \\noutside, dismissed to await allotted work or punishment. Even in the mind of \\nThjoden the thought took shape, like a shadow of doubt: \\'He will betray us; \\nhe will go -- we shall be lost.\\' \\n\\nThen Gandalf laughed. The fantasy vanished like a puff of smoke. \\n\\n\\'Saruman, Saruman!\\' said Gandalf still laughing. \\'Saruman, you missed \\nyour path in life. You should have been the king\\'s jester and earned your \\nbread, and stripes too, by mimicking his counsellors. Ah me!\\' he paused, \\ngetting the better of his mirth. \\'Understand one another? I fear I am beyond \\nyour comprehension. But you, Saruman, I understand now too well. I keep a \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nclearer memory of your arguments, and deeds, than you suppose. When last I \\nvisited you, you were the jailor of Mordor, and there I was to be sent. Nay, \\nthe guest who has escaped from the roof, will think twice before he comes \\nback in by the door. Nay, I do not think I will come up. But listen, \\nSaruman, for the last time! Will you not come down? Isengard has proved less \\nstrong than your hope and fancy made it. So may other things in which you \\nstill have trust. Would it not be well to leave it for a while? To turn to \\nnew things, perhaps? Think well, Saruman! Will you not come down?\\' \\n\\nA shadow passed over Saruman\\'s face; then it went deathly white. Before \\nhe could conceal it, they saw through the mask the anguish of a mind in \\ndoubt, loathing to stay and dreading to leave its refuge. For a second he \\nhesitated, and no one breathed. Then he spoke, and his voice was shrill and \\ncold. Pride and hate were conquering him. \\n\\n\\'Will I come down?\\' he mocked. \\'Does an unarmed man come down to \\nspeak \\n\\nwith robbers out of doors? I can hear you w ell enough here. I am no fool, \\nand I do not trust you, Gandalf. They do not stand openly on my stairs, but \\nI know where the wild wood-demons are lurking, at your command.\\' \\n\\n\\'The treacherous are ever distrustful,\\' answered Gandalf wearily. \\'But \\nyou need not fear for your skin. I do not wish to kill you, or hurt you, as \\nyou would know, if you really understood me. And I have the power to protect \\nyou. I am giving you a last chance. You can leave Orthanc, free -- if you \\nchoose.\\' \\n\\n\\'That sounds well,\\' sneered Saruman. \\'Very much in the manner of \\nGandalf the Grey: so condescending, and so very kind. I do not doubt that \\nyou would find Orthanc commodious, and my departure convenient. But \\nwhy \\n\\nshould I wish to leave? And what do you mean by \\'free\\'? There are \\nconditions, I presume?\\' \\n\\n\\'Reasons for leaving you can see from your windows.\\' answered Gandalf. \\n\\'Others will occur to your thought. Your servants are destroyed and \\nscattered; your neighbours you have made your enemies; and you have cheated \\nyour new master, or tried to do so. When his eye turns hither, it will be \\nthe red eye of wrath. But when I say \\'free\\', I mean \\'free\\': free from bond, \\nof chain or command: to go where you will, even, even to Mordor, Saruman, if \\nyou desire. But you will first surrender to me the Key of Orthanc, and your \\nstaff. They shall be pledges of your conduct, to be returned later, if you \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmerit them.\\' \\n\\nSaruman\\'s face grew livid, twisted with rage, and a red light was \\nkindled in his eyes. He laughed wildly. \\'Later!\\' he cried, and his voice \\nrose to a scream. \\'Later! Yes, when you also have the Keys ofBarad-dyr \\nitself, I suppose; and the crowns of seven kings, and the rods of the Five \\nWizards, and have purchased yourself a pair of boots many sizes larger than \\nthose that you wear now. A modest plan. Hardly one in which my help is \\nneeded! I have other things to do. Do not be a fool. If you wish to treat \\nwith me, while you have a chance, go away, and come back when you are \\nsober! \\n\\nAnd leave behind these cut-throats and small rag-tag that dangle at your \\ntail! Good day!\\' He turned and left the balcony. \\n\\n\\'Come back, Saruman!\\' said Gandalf in a commanding voice. To the \\namazement of the others, Saruman turned again, and as if dragged against his \\nwill, he came slowly back to the iron rail, leaning on it, breathing hard. \\n\\nHis face was lined and shrunken. His hand clutched his heavy black staff \\nlike a claw. \\n\\n\\'I did not give you leave to go,\\' said Gandalf sternly. \\'I have not \\nfinished. You have become a fool, Saruman, and yet pitiable. You might still \\nhave turned away from folly and evil, and have been of service. But you \\nchoose to stay and gnaw the ends of your old plots. Stay then! But I warn \\nyou. you will not easily come out again. Not unless the dark hands of the \\nEast stretch out to take you. Saruman!\\' he cried, and his voice grew in \\npower and authority. \\'Behold, I am not Gandalf the Grey, whom you betrayed. \\nI am Gandalf the White, who has returned from death. You have no colour \\nnow, \\n\\nand I cast you from the order and from the Council.\\' \\n\\nHe raised his hand, and spoke slowly in a clear cold voice. \\'Saruman, \\nyour staff is broken.\\' There was a crack, and the staff split asunder in \\nSaruman\\'s hand, and the head of it fell down at Gandalf s feet. \\'Go!\\' said \\nGandalf. With a cry Saruman fell back and crawled away. At that moment a \\nheavy shining thing came hurtling down from above. It glanced off the iron \\nrail, even as Saruman left it, and passing close to Gandalf \\'s head, it smote \\nthe stair on which he stood. The rail rang and snapped. The stair cracked \\nand splintered in glittering sparks. But the ball was unharmed: it rolled on \\ndown the steps, a globe of crystal, dark, but glowing with a heart of fire. \\n\\nAs it bounded away towards a pool Pippin ran after it and picked it up. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'The murderous rogue!\\' cried Jomer. But Gandalf was unmoved. No, that \\nwas not thrown b Saruman, he said; nor even at his bidding, I think. It came \\nfrom a window far above. A parting shot from Master Wormtongue, I fancy, \\nbut \\n\\nill aimed.\\' \\n\\n\\'The aim was poor, maybe, because he could not make up his mind which \\nhe hated more, you or Saruman,\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\n\\'That may be so,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Small comfort will those two have in \\ntheir companionship: they will gnaw one another with words. But the \\npunishment is just. If Wormtongue ever comes out of Orthanc alive, it will \\nbe more than he deserves. \\n\\n\\'Here, my lad, I\\'ll take that! I did not ask you to handle it,\\' he \\ncried, turning sharply and seeing Pippin coming up the steps, slowly, as if \\nhe were bearing a great weight. He went down to meet him and hastily took \\nthe dark globe from the hobbit, wrapping it in the folds of his cloak. \\'I \\nwill take care of this,\\' he said. \\'It is not a thing, I guess, that Saruman \\nwould have chosen to cast away.\\' \\n\\n\\'But he may have other things to cast,\\' said Gimli. \\'If that is the end \\nof the debate, let us go out of stone\\'s throw, at least!\\' \\n\\n\\'It is the end,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Let us go.\\' \\n\\nThey turned their backs on the doors of Orthanc, and went down. The \\nriders hailed the king with joy, and saluted Gandalf. The spell of Saruman \\nwas broken: they had seen him come at call, and crawl away, dismissed. \\n\\n\\'Well, that is done,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Now I must find Treebeard and tell \\nhim how things have gone.\\' \\n\\n\\'He will have guessed, surely?\\' said Merry. \\'Were they likely to end \\nany other way?\\' \\n\\n\\'Not likely,\\' answered Gandalf, \\'though they came to the balance of a \\nhair. But I had reasons for trying; some merciful and some less so. First \\nSaruman was shown that the power of his voice was waning. He cannot be \\nboth \\n\\ntyrant and counsellor. When the plot is ripe it remains no longer secret. \\n\\nYet he fell into the trap, and tried to deal with his victims piece-meal, \\nwhile others listened. Then I gave him a last choice and a fair one: to \\nrenounce both Mordor and his private schemes, and make amends by helping \\nus \\n\\nin our need. He knows our need, none better. Great service he could have \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nrendered. But he has chosen to withhold it, and keep the power of Orthanc. \\nHe will not serve, only command. He lives now in terror of the shadow of \\nMordor, and yet he still dreams of riding the storm. Unhappy fool! He will \\nbe devoured, if the power of the East stretches out its arms to Isengard. We \\ncannot destroy Orthanc from without, but Sauron -- who knows what he can \\ndo?\\' \\n\\n\\'And what if Sauron does not conquer? What will you do to him?\\' asked \\nPippin. \\n\\n\\'I? Nothing!\\' said Gandalf. \\'I will do nothing to him. I do not wish \\nfor mastery. What w ill become of him? I cannot say. I grieve that so much \\nthat was good now festers in the tower. Still for us things have not gone \\nbadly. Strange are the turns of fortune! Often does hatred hurt itself! I \\nguess that, even if we had entered in, we could have found few treasures in \\nOrthanc more precious than the thing which Wormtongue threw down at us.\\' \\n\\nA shrill shriek; suddenly cut off, came from an open window high above. \\n\\n\\'It seems that Saruman thinks so too,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Let us leave \\nthem!\\' \\n\\nThey returned now to the ruins of the gate. Hardly had they passed out \\nunder the arch, when, from among the shadows of the piled stones where they \\nhad stood, Treebeard and a dozen other Ents came striding up. Aragorn, Gimli \\nand Legolas gazed at them in wonder. \\n\\n\\'Here are three of my companions, Treebeard,\\' said Gandalf. \\'I have \\nspoken of them, but you have not yet seen them.\\' He named them one by one. \\n\\nThe Old Ent looked at them long and searchingly, and spoke to them in \\nturn. Last he turned to Legolas. \\'So you have come all the way from \\nMirkwood, my good Elf? A very great forest it used to be!\\' \\n\\n\\'And still is,\\' said Legolas. \\'But not so great that we who dwell there \\never tire of seeing new trees. I should dearly love to journey in Fangorn\\'s \\nWood. I scarcely passed beyond the eaves of it, and I did not wish to turn \\nback.\\' \\n\\nTreebeard\\'s eyes gleamed with pleasure. \\'I hope you may have your wish, \\nere the hills be much older,\\' he said. \\n\\n\\'I will come, if I have the fortune,\\' said Legolas. \\'I have made a \\nbargain with my friend that, if all goes well, we will visit Fangorn \\ntogether -- by your leave.\\' \\n\\n\\'Any Elf that comes with you will be welcome,\\' said Treebeard. \\n\\n\\'The friend I speak of is not an Elf,\\' said Legolas; \\'I mean Gimli, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGluin\\'s son here.\\' Gimli bowed low, and the axe slipped from his belt and \\nclattered on the ground. \\n\\n\\'Hoom, hm! Ah now,\\' said Treebeard, looking dark-eyed at him. A dwarf \\nand an axe-bearer! Hoom! I have good will to Elves; but you ask much. This \\nis a strange friendship!\\' \\'Strange it may seem,\\' said Legolas; \\'but while \\nGimli lives I shall not come to Fangorn alone. His axe is not for trees, but \\nfor ore-necks, O Fangorn, Master of Fangorn\\'s Wood. Forty -two he hewed in \\nthe battle.\\' \\n\\n\\'Hoo! Come now!\\' said Treebeard. \\'That is a better story! Well, well, \\nthings will go as they will; and there is no need to hurry to meet them. But \\nnow we must part for a while. Day is drawing to an end, yet Gandalf says you \\nmust go ere nightfall, and the Ford of the Mark is eager for his own house.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, we must go, and go now,\\' said Gandalf. \\'I fear that I must take \\nyour gatekeepers from you. But you will manage well enough without them.\\' \\n\\n\\'Maybe I shall,\\' said Treebeard. \\'But I shall miss them. We have become \\nfriends in so short a while that I think I must be getting hasty -- growing \\nbackwards towards youth, perhaps. But there, they are the first new thing \\nunder Sun or Moon that I have seen for many a long, long day. I shall not \\nforget them. I have put their names into the Fong Fist. Ents will remember \\nit. \\n\\nEnts the earthborn, old as mountains, \\n\\nthe wide-walkers, water drinking; \\n\\nand hungry as hunters, the Hobbit children, \\n\\nthe laughing-folk, the little people, \\n\\nthey shall remain friends as long as leaves are renewed. Fare you well! \\n\\nBut if you hear news up in your pleasant land, in the Shire, send me word! \\nYou know what I mean: word or sight of the Entwives. Come yourselves if \\nyou \\ncan!\\' \\n\\n\\'We will!\\' said Merry and Pippin together, and they turned away \\nhastily. Treebeard looked at them, and was silent for a while, shaking his \\nhead thoughtfully. Then he turned to Gandalf. \\n\\n\\'So Saruman would not leave?\\' he said. \\'I did not think he would. His \\nheart is as rotten as a black Huorn\\'s. Still, if I were overcome and all my \\ntrees destroyed, I would not come while I had one dark hole left to hide \\nin.\\' \\n\\n\\'No,\\' said Gandalf. \\'But you have not plotted to cover all the world \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwith your trees and choke all other living things. But there it is, Saruman \\nremains to nurse his hatred and weave again such webs as he can. He has the \\nKey of Orthanc. But he must not be allowed to escape.\\' \\n\\n\\'Indeed no! Ents will see to that,\\' said Treebeard. \\'Saruman shall not \\nset foot beyond the rock, without my leave. Ents will watch over him.\\' \\n\\n\\'Good!\\' said Gandalf. \\'That is what I hoped. Now I can go and turn to \\nother matters with one care the less. But you must be wary. The waters have \\ngone down. It will not be enough to put sentinels round the tower, I fear. I \\ndo not doubt that there were deep ways delved under Orthanc, and that \\nSaruman hopes to go and come unmarked, before long. If you will undertake \\nthe labour, I beg you to pour in the waters again; and do so, until Isengard \\nremains a standing pool, or you discover the outlets. When all the \\nunderground places are drowned, and the outlets blocked, then Saruman must \\nstay upstairs and look out of the windows.\\' \\n\\n\\'Leave it to the Ents!\\' said Treebeard. \\'We shall search the valley \\nfrom head to foot and peer under every pebble. Trees are coming back to live \\nhere, old trees, wild trees. The Watchwood we will call it. Not a squirrel \\nwill go here, but I shall know of it. Leave it to Ents ! Until seven times \\nthe years in which he tormented us have passed, we shall not tire of \\nwatching him.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 11. The Palantnr \\n\\n\\n\\nThe sun was sinking behind the long western arm of the mountains when \\nGandalf and his companions, and the king with his Riders, set out again from \\nIsengard. Gandalf took Merry behind him, and Aragorn took Pippin. Two of \\nthe \\n\\nking\\'s men went on ahead, riding swiftly, and passed soon out of sight down \\ninto the valley. The others followed at an easy pace. \\n\\nEnts in a solemn row stood like statues at the gate, with their long \\narms uplifted, but they made no sound. Merry and Pippin looked back, when \\nthey had passed some way down the winding road. Sunlight was still shining \\nin the sky, but long shadows reached over Isengard: grey ruins falling into \\ndarkness. Treebeard stood alone there now, like the distant stump of an old \\ntree: the hobbits thought of their first meeting, upon the sunny ledge far \\naway on the borders of Fangorn. \\n\\nThey came to the pillar of the White Hand. The pillar was still \\nstanding, but the graven hand had been thrown down and broken into small \\npieces. Right in the middle of the road the long forefinger lay, white in \\nthe dusk, its red nail darkening to black. \\n\\n\\'The Ents pay attention to every detail!\\' said Gandalf. \\n\\nThey rode on, and evening deepened in the valley. \\n\\n\\'Are we riding far tonight, Gandalf?\\' asked Merry after a while. \\'I \\ndon\\'t know how you feel with small rag-tag dangling behind you; but the \\nrag-tag is tired and will be glad to stop dangling and lie down.\\' \\n\\n\\'So you heard that?\\' said Gandalf. \\'Don\\'t let it rankle! Be thankful no \\nlonger words were aimed at you. He had his eyes on you. If it is any comfort \\nto your pride, I should say that, at the moment, you and Pippin are more in \\nhis thoughts than all the rest of us. Who you are; how you came there, and \\nwhy; what you know; whether you were captured, and if so, how you escaped \\nwhen all the Ores perished -- it is with those little riddles that the great \\nmind ^ Saruman is troubled. A sneer from him, Meriadoc, is a compliment, if \\nyou feel honoured by his concern.\\' \\n\\n\\'Thank you!\\' said Merry. \\'But it is a greater honour to dangle at your \\ntail, Gandalf. For one thing, in that position one has a chance of putting a \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nquestion a second time. Are we riding far tonight?\\' \\n\\nGandalf laughed. \\'A most unquenchable hobbit! All Wizards should have a \\nhobbit or two in their care -- to teach them the meaning of the word, and to \\ncorrect them. I beg your pardon. But I have given thought even to these \\nsimple matters. We will ride for a few hours, gently, until we come to the \\nend of the valley. Tomorrow we must ride faster. \\n\\n\\'When we came, we meant to go straight from Isengard back to the king\\'s \\nhouse at Edoras over the plains, a ride of some days. But we have taken \\nthought and changed the plan. Messengers have gone ahead to Helm\\'s Deep, to \\nwarn them that the king is returning tomorrow. He will ride from there with \\nmany men to Dunharrow by paths among the hills. From now on no more than \\ntwo \\n\\nor three together are to go openly over the land, by day or night, when it \\ncan be avoided.\\' \\n\\n\\'Nothing or a double helping is your way!\\' said Merry. \\'I am afraid I \\nwas not looking beyond tonight\\'s bed. Where and what are Helm\\'s Deep and all \\nthe rest of it? I don\\'t know anything about this country.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then you\\'d best learn something, if you wish to understand what is \\nhappening. But not just now, and not from me: I have too many pressing \\nthings to think about.\\' \\n\\n\\'All right, I\\'ll tackle Strider by the camp-fire: he\\'s less testy. But \\nwhy all this secrecy? I thought we\\'d won the battle!\\' \\n\\nYes, we have won, but only the first victor and that in itself \\nincreases our danger. There was some link between Isengard and Mordor, \\nwhich \\n\\nI have not yet fathomed. How they exchanged news I am not sure; but they did \\nso. The Eye of Barad-dyr will be looking impatiently towards the Wizard\\'s \\nVale, I think; and towards Rohan. The less it sees the better.\\' \\n\\nThe road passed slowly, winding down the valley. Now further, and now \\nnearer Isen flowed in its stony bed. Night came down from the mountains. All \\nthe mists were gone. A chill wind blew. The moon, now waxing round, filled \\nthe eastern sky with a pale cold sheen. The shoulders of the mountain to \\ntheir right sloped down to bare hills. The wide plains opened grey before \\nthem. \\n\\nAt last they halted. Then they turned aside, leaving the highway and \\ntaking to the sweet upland turf again. Going westward a mile or so they came \\nto a dale. It opened southward, leaning back into the slope of round Dol \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBaran, the last hill of the northern ranges, greenfooted, crowned with \\nheather. The sides of the glen were shaggy with last year\\'s bracken, among \\nwhich the tight-curled fronds of spring were just thrusting through the \\nsweet-scented earth. Thornbushes grew thick upon the low banks, and under \\nthem they made their camp, two hours or so before the middle of the night. \\nThey lit a fire in a hollow, down among the roots of a spreading hawthorn, \\ntall as a tree, writhen with age; but hale in every limb. Buds were swelling \\nat each twig\\'s tip. \\n\\nGuards were set, two at a watch. The rest, after they had supped, \\nwrapped themselves in a cloak and blanket and slept. The hobbits lay in a \\ncorner by themselves upon a pile of old bracken. Merry was sleepy, but \\nPippin now seemed curiously restless. The bracken cracked and rustled, as he \\ntwisted and turned. \\n\\n\\'What\\'s the matter?\\' asked Merry. \\'Are you lying on an ant-hill?\\' \\n\\n\\'No,\\' said Pippin, \\'but I\\'m not comfortable. I wonder how long it is \\nsince I slept in a bed?\\' \\n\\nMerry yawned. \\'Work it out on your fingers!\\' he said. \\'But you must \\nknow how long it is since we left Lurien.\\' \\n\\n\\'Oh, that!\\' said Pippin. \\'I mean a real bed in a bedroom.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, Rivendell then,\\' said Merry. \\'But I could sleep anywhere \\ntonight.\\' \\n\\n\\'You had the luck, Merry,\\' said Pippin softly, after a long pause. \\'You \\nwere riding with Gandalf.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, what of it?\\' \\n\\n\\'Did you get any news, any information out of him?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, a good deal. More than usual. But you heard it all or most of it: \\nyou were close by, and we were talking no secrets. But you can go with him \\ntomorrow, if you think you can get more out of him-and if he\\'ll have you.\\' \\n\\n\\'Can I? Good! But he\\'s close, isn\\'t he? Not changed at all.\\' \\n\\n\\'Oh yes, he is!\\' said Merry, waking up a little, and beginning to \\nwonder what was bothering his companion. \\'He has grown, or something. He \\ncan \\n\\nbe both kinder and more alarming, merrier and more solemn than before, I \\nthink. He has changed; but we have not had a chance to see how much, yet. \\nBut think of the last part of that business with Saruman! Remember Saruman \\nwas once Gandalf s superior: head of the Council, whatever that may be \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nexactly. He was Saruman the White. Gandalf is the White now. Saruman \\ncame \\n\\nwhen he was told, and his rod was taken; and then he was just told to go, \\nand he went!\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, if Gandalf has changed at all, then he\\'s closer than ever that\\'s \\nall,\\' Pippin argued. \\'That-glass ball, now. He seemed mighty pleased with \\nit. He knows or guesses something about it. But does he tell us what? No, \\nnot a word. Yet I picked it up, and I saved it from rolling into a pool. \\n\\nHere, I\\'ll take that, my lad -- that\\'s all. I wonder what it is? It felt so \\nvery heavy.\\' Pippin\\'s voice fell very low as if he was talking to himself. \\n\\n\\'Hullo!\\' said Merry. \\'So that\\'s what is bothering you? Now, Pippin my \\nlad, don\\'t forget Gildor\\'s saying -- the one Sam used to quote: Do not \\nmeddle in the at Fairs of Wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger.\\' \\n\\n\\'But our whole life for months has been one long meddling in the \\naffairs of Wizards,\\' said Pippin. \\'I should like a bit of information as \\nwell as danger. I should like a look at that ball.\\' \\n\\n\\'Go to sleep!\\' said Merry. \\'You\\'ll get information enough, sooner or \\nlater. My dear Pippin, no Took ever beat a Brandybuck for inquisitiveness; \\nbut is this the time, I ask you?\\' \\n\\n\\'All right! What\\'s the harm in my telling you what I should like: a \\nlook at that stone? I know I can\\'t have it, with old Gandalf sitting on it, \\nlike a hen on an egg. But it doesn\\'t help much to get no more from you than \\na you-can \\'t-have-it so -go -to -sleep ! \\' \\n\\n\\'Well, what else could I say?\\' said Merry. \\'I\\'m sorry, Pippin, but you \\nreally must wait till the morning. I\\'ll be as curious as you like after \\nbreakfast, and I\\'ll help in any way I can at wizard-wheedling. But I can\\'t \\nkeep awake any longer. If I yawn any more, I shall split at the ears. Good \\nnight!\\' \\n\\nPippin said no more. He lay still now, but sleep remained far away; and \\nit was not encouraged by the sound of Merry breathing softly, asleep in a \\nfew minutes after saying good night. \\'The thought of the dark globe seemed \\nto grow stronger as all grew quiet. Pippin felt again its weight in his \\nhands, and saw again the mysterious red depths into which he had looked for \\na moment. He tossed and turned and tried to think of something else. \\n\\nAt last he could stand it no longer. He got up and looked round. It was \\nchilly, and he wrapped his cloak about him. The moon was shining cold and \\nwhite, down into the dell, and the shadows of the bushes were black. All \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nabout lay sleeping shapes. The two guards were not in view: they were up on \\nthe hill, perhaps, or hidden in the bracken. Driven by some impulse that he \\ndid not understand, Pippin walked softly to where Gandalf lay. He looked \\ndown at him. The wizard seemed asleep, but with lids not fully closed: there \\nwas a glitter of eyes under his long lashes. Pippin stepped back hastily. \\n\\nBut Gandalf made no sign; and drawn forward once more, half against his \\nwill, the hobbit crept up again from behind the wizard\\'s head. He was rolled \\nin a blanket, with his cloak spread over the top; and close beside him, \\nbetween his right side and his bent arm, there was a hummock, something \\nround wrapped in a dark cloth; his hand seemed only just to have slipped off \\nit to the ground. \\n\\nHardly breathing, Pippin crept nearer, foot by foot. At last he knelt \\ndown. Then he put his hands out stealthily, and slowly lifted the lump up: \\nit did not seem quite so heavy as he had expected. \\'Only some bundle of \\noddments, perhaps, after all,\\' he thought with a strange sense of relief; \\nbut he did not put the bundle down again. He stood for a moment clasping it. \\nThen an idea came into his mind. He tiptoed away, found a large stone, and \\ncame back. \\n\\nQuickly now he drew off the cloth, wrapped the stone in it and kneeling \\ndown, laid it back by the wizard\\'s hand. Then at last he looked at the thing \\nthat he had uncovered. There it was: a smooth globe of crystal, now dark and \\ndead, lying bare before his knees. Pippin lifted it, covered it hurriedly in \\nhis own cloak, and half turned to go back to his bed. At that moment Gandalf \\nmoved in his sleep, and muttered some words: they seemed to be in a strange \\ntongue; his hand groped out and clasped the wrapped stone, then he sighed \\nand did not move again. \\n\\n\\'You idiotic fool!\\' Pippin muttered to himself. \\'You\\'re going to get \\nyourself into frightful trouble. Put it back quick!\\' But he found now that \\nhis knees quaked, and he did not dare to go near enough to the wizard to \\nreach the bundle. \\'I\\'ll never get it back now without waking him,\\' he \\nthought, \\'not till I\\'m a bit calmer. S0I may as well have a look first. Not \\njust here though!\\' He stole away, and sat down on a green hillock not far \\nfrom his bed. The moon looked in over the edge of the dell. \\n\\nPippin sat with his knees drawn up and the ball between them. He bent \\nlow over it, looking like a greedy child stooping over a bowl of food, in a \\ncorner away from others. He drew his cloak aside and gazed at it. The air \\nseemed still and tense about him. At first the globe was dark, black as jet, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwith the moonlight gleaming on its surface. Then there came a faint glow and \\nstir in the heart of it, and it held his eyes, so that now he could not look \\naway. Soon all the inside seemed on fire; the ball was spinning, or the \\nlights within were revolving. Suddenly the lights went out. He gave a gasp \\nand struggled; but he remained bent, clasping the ball with both hands. \\nCloser and closer he bent, and then became rigid; his lips moved soundlessly \\nfor a while. Then with a strangled cry he fell back and lay still. \\n\\nThe cry was piercing. The guards leapt down from the banks. All the \\ncamp was soon astir. \\n\\n\\'So this is the thief!\\' said Gandalf. Hastily he cast his cloak over \\nthe globe where it lay. \\'But you, Pippin! This is a grievous turn to \\nthings!\\' He knelt by Pippin\\'s body: the hobbit was lying on his back rigid, \\nwith unseeing eyes staring up at the sky. \\'The devilry! What mischief has he \\ndone-to himself, and to all of us?\\' The wizard\\'s face was drawn and haggard. \\n\\nHe took Pippin\\'s hand and bent over his face, listening for his breath; \\nthen he laid his hands on his brow. The hobbit shuddered. His eyes closed. \\nHe cried out; and sat up. staring in bewilderment at all the faces round \\nhim, pale in the moonlight. \\n\\n\\'It is not for you, Saruman!\\' he cried in a shrill and toneless voice \\nshrinking away from Gandalf. \\'I will send for it at once. Do you understand? \\nSay just that!\\' Then he struggled to get up and escape but Gandalf held him \\ngently and firmly. \\n\\n\\'Peregrin Took!\\' he said. \\'Come back!\\' \\n\\nThe hobbit relaxed and fell back, clinging to the wizard\\'s hand. \\n\\'Gandalf!\\' he cried. \\'Gandalf! Forgive me!\\' \\n\\n\\'Forgive you?\\' said the wizard. \\'Tell me first what you have done!\\' \\n\\n\\'I, I took the ball and looked at it,\\' stammered Pippin; \\'and I saw \\nthings that frightened me. And I wanted to go away, but I couldn\\'t. And then \\nhe came and questioned me; and he looked at me, and, and that is all I \\nremember.\\' \\n\\n\\'That won\\'t do,\\' said Gandalf sternly. \\'What did you see, and what did \\nyou say?\\' \\n\\nPippin shut his eyes and shivered, but said nothing. They all stared at \\nhim in silence, except Merry who turned away. But Gandalf s face was still \\nhard. \\'Speak!\\' he said. \\n\\nIn a low hesitating voice Pippin began again, and slowly his words grew \\nclearer and stronger. \\'I saw a dark sky, and tall battlements,\\' he said. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'And tiny stars. It seemed very far away and long ago, yet hard and clear. \\nThen the stars went in and out-they were cut off by things with wings. Very \\nbig, I think, really; but in the glass they looked like bats wheeling round \\nthe tower. I thought there were nine of them. One began to fly straight \\ntowards me, getting bigger and bigger. It had a horrible -- no, no! I can\\'t \\nsay. \\n\\n\\'I tried to get away, because I thought it would fly out; but when it \\nhad covered all the globe, it disappeared. Then he came. He did not speak so \\nthat I could hear words. He just looked, and I understood. \\n\\n\"\\'So you have come back? Why have you neglected to report for so long?\" \\n\\n\\'I did not answer. He said: \"Who are you?\" I still did not answer, but \\nit hurt me horribly; and he pressed me, so I said: \"A hobbit.\" \\n\\n\\'Then suddenly he seemed to see me, and he laughed at me. It was cruel. \\n\\nIt was like being stabbed with knives. I struggled. But he said: \"Wait a \\nmoment! We shall meet again soon. Tell Saruman that this dainty is not for \\nhim. I will send for it at once. Do you understand? Say just that!\" \\n\\n\\'Then he gloated over me. I felt I was falling to pieces. No, no! I \\ncan\\'t say any more. I don\\'t remember anything else.\\' \\n\\n\\'Look at me!\\' said Gandalf. \\n\\nPippin looked up straight into his eyes. The wizard held his gaze for a \\nmoment in silence. Then his face grew gentler, and the shadow of a smile \\nappeared. He laid his hand softly on Pippin\\'s head. \\n\\n\\'All right!\\' he said. \\'Say no more! You have taken no harm. There is no \\nlie in your eyes, as I feared. But he did not speak long with you. A fool, \\nbut an honest fool, you remain, Peregrin Took. Wiser ones might have done \\nworse in such a pass. But mark this! You have been saved, and all your \\nfriends too, mainly by good fortune, as it is called. You cannot count on it \\na second time. If he had questioned you, then and there, almost certainly \\nyou would have told all that you know, to the ruin of us all. But he was too \\neager. He did not want information only: he wanted you, quickly, so that he \\ncould deal with you in the Dark Tower, slowly. Don\\'t shudder! If you will \\nmeddle in the affairs of Wizards, you must be prepared to think of such \\nthings. But come! I forgive you. Be comforted! Things have not turned out as \\nevilly as they might.\\' \\n\\nHe lifted Pippin gently and carried him back to his bed. Merry \\nfollowed, and sat down beside him. Lie there and rest, if you can, Pippin!\\' \\nsaid Gandalf. \\'Trust me. If you feel an itch in your palms again, tell me of \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nit! Such things can be cured. But anyway, my dear hobbit, don\\'t put a lump \\nof rock under my elbow again! Now, I will leave you two together for a \\nwhile.\\' \\n\\nWith that Gandalf returned to the others, who were still standing by \\nthe Orthanc-stone in troubled thought. \\'Peril comes in the night when least \\nexpected,\\' he said. \\'We have had a narrow escape!\\' \\n\\n\\'How is the hobbit, Pippin?\\' asked Aragorn. \\n\\n\\'I think all will be well now,\\' answered Gandalf. \\'He was not held \\nlong, and hobbits have an amazing power of recovery. The memory, or the \\nhorror of it, will probably fade quickly. Too quickly, perhaps. Will you, \\nAragorn, take the Orthanc-stone and guard it? It is a dangerous charge.\\' \\n\\n\\'Dangerous indeed, but not to all,\\' said Aragorn. \\'There is one who may \\nclaim it by right. For this assuredly is the palantnr of Orthanc from the \\ntreasury of Elendil, set here by the Kings of Gondor. Now my hour draws \\nnear. I will take it.\\' \\n\\nGandalf looked at Aragorn, and then, to the surprise of the others, he \\nlifted the covered Stone, and bowed as he presented it. \\n\\n\\'Receive it, lord!\\' he said: \\'in earnest of other things that shall be \\ngiven back. But if I may counsel you in the use of your own, do not use it \\n-- yet! Be wary!\\' \\n\\n\\'When have I been hasty or unwary, who have waited and prepared for so \\nmany long years?\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\n\\'Never yet. Do not then stumble at the end of the road,\\' answered \\nGandalf. \\'But at the least keep this thing secret. You, and all others that \\nstand here ! The hobbit, Peregrin, above all should not know where it is \\nbestowed. The evil fit may come on him again. For alas ! he has handled it \\nand looked in it, as should never have happened. He ought never to have \\ntouched it in Isengard, and there I should have been quicker. But my mind \\nwas bent on Saruman, and I did not at once guess the nature of the Stone. \\nThen I was weary, and as I lay pondering it, sleep overcame me. Now I know!\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, there can be no doubt,\\' said Aragorn. \\'At last we know the link\\' \\nbetween Isengard and Mordor, and how it worked. Much is explained.\\' \\'Strange \\npowers have our enemies, and strange weaknesses!\\' said Thjoden. \\'But it has \\nlong been said: oft evil will shall evil mar.\\' \\n\\n\\'That many times is seen,\\' said Gandalf. \\'But at this time we have been \\nstrangely fortunate. Maybe, I have been saved by this hobbit from a grave \\nblunder. I had considered whether or not to probe this Stone myself to find \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nits uses. Had I done so, I should have been revealed to him myself. I am not \\nready for such a trial, if indeed I shall ever be so: But even if I found \\nthe power to withdraw myself, it would be disastrous for him to see me, yet \\n-- until the hour comes when secrecy will avail no longer.\\' \\n\\n\\'That hour is now come, I think,\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\n\\'Not yet,\\' said Gandalf. \\'There remains a short while of doubt which we \\nmust use. The Enemy, it is clear, thought that the Stone was in Orthanc -- \\nwhy should he not? And that therefore the hobbit was captive there, driven \\nto look in the glass for his torment by Saruman. That dark mind will be \\nfilled now with the voice and face of the hobbit and with expectation: it \\nmay take some time before he learns his error. We must snatch that time. We \\nhave been too leisurely. We must move. The neighbourhood of Isengard is no \\nplace now to linger in. I will ride ahead at once with Peregrin Took. It \\nwill be better for him than lying in the dark while others sleep.\\' \\n\\n\\'I will keep Jomer and ten Riders,\\' said the king. \\'They shall ride \\nwith me at early day. The rest may go with Aragorn and ride as soon as they \\nhave a mind.\\' \\n\\n\\'As you will,\\' said Gandalf. \\'But make all the speed you may to the \\ncover of the hills, to Helm\\'s Deep!\\' \\n\\nAt that moment a shadow fell over them. The bright moonlight seemed to \\nbe suddenly cut off. Several of the Riders cried out, and crouched, holding \\ntheir arms above their heads, as if to ward off a blow from above: a blind \\nfear and a deadly cold fell on them. Cowering they looked up. A vast winged \\nshape passed over the moon like a black cloud. It wheeled and went north, \\nflying at a speed greater than any wind of Middle -earth. The stars fainted \\nbefore it. It was gone. \\n\\nThey stood up, rigid as stones. Gandalf was gazing up, his arms out and \\ndownwards, stiff, his hands clenched. \\n\\n\\'Nazgyl!\\' he cried. \\'The messenger of Mordor. The storm is coming. The \\nNazgyl have crossed the River! Ride, ride! Wait not for the dawn! Let not \\nthe swift wait for the slow! Ride!\\' \\n\\nHe sprang away, calling Shadowfax as he ran. Aragorn followed him. \\nGoing to Pippin, Gandalf picked him up in his arms. \\'You shall come with me \\nthis time,\\' he said. \\'Shadowfax shall show you his paces.\\' Then he ran to \\nthe place where he had slept. Shadowfax stood there already. Slinging the \\nsmall bag which was all his luggage across his shoulders, the wizard leapt \\nupon the horse\\'s back. Aragorn lifted Pippin and set him in Gandalf s arms, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n, wrapped in cloak and blanket. \\n\\n\\'Farewell! Follow fast!\\' cried Gandalf. \\'Away, Shadowfax!\\' \\n\\nThe great horse tossed his head. His flowing tail flicked in the \\nmoonlight. Then he leapt forward, spurning the earth, and was gone like the \\nnorth wind from the mountains. \\n\\n\\'A beautiful, restful night!\\' said Merry to Aragorn. \\'Some folk have \\nwonderful luck. He did not want to sleep, and he wanted to ride with Gandalf \\n-- and there he goes ! Instead of being turned into a stone himself to stand \\nhere for ever as a warning.\\' \\n\\n\\'If you had been the first to lift the Orthanc-stone, and not he, how \\nwould it be now?\\' said Aragorn. \\'You might have done worse. Who can say? \\nBut \\n\\nnow it is your luck to come with me, I fear. At once. Go and get ready, and \\nbring anything that Pippin left behind. Make haste!\\' \\n\\nOver the plains Shadowfax was flying, needing no urging and no \\nguidance. Less than an hour had passed, and they had reached the Fords of \\nIsen and crossed them. The Mound of the Riders and its cold spears lay grey \\nbehind them. \\n\\nPippin was recovering. He was warm, but the wind in his face was keen \\nand refreshing. He was with Gandalf. The horror of the stone and of the \\nhideous shadow over the moon was fading, things left behind in the mists of \\nthe mountains or in a passing dream. He drew a deep breath. \\n\\n\\'I did not know you rode bare-back, Gandalf,\\' he said. \\'You haven\\'t a \\nsaddle or a bridle!\\' \\n\\n\\'I do not ride elf-fashion, except on Shadowfax,\\' said Gandalf. \\'But \\nShadowfax will have no harness. You do not ride Shadowfax: he is willing to \\ncarry you-or not. If he is willing, that is enough. It is then his business \\nto see that you remain on his back, unless you jump off into the air.\\' \\n\\n\\'How fast is he going?\\' asked Pippin. \\'Fast by the wind, but very \\nsmooth. And how light his footfalls are!\\' \\n\\n\\'He is running now as fast as the swiftest horse could gallop,\\' \\nanswered Gandalf; \\'but that is not fast for him. The land is rising a little \\nhere, and is more broken than it was beyond the river. But see how the White \\nMountains are drawing near under the stars! Yonder are the Thrihyrne peaks \\nlike black spears. It will not be long before we reach the branching roads \\nand come to the Deeping-coomb, where the battle was fought two nights ago.\\' \\n\\nPippin was silent again for a while. He heard Gandalf singing softly to \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhimself, murmuring brief snatches of rhyme in many tongues, as the miles ran \\nunder them. At last the wizard passed into a song of which the hobbit caught \\nthe words: a few lines came clear to his ears through the rushing of the \\nwind: \\n\\nTall ships and tall kings \\n\\nThree times three, \\n\\nWhat brought they from the foundered land \\n\\nOver the flowing sea? \\n\\nSeven stars and seven stones \\n\\nAnd one white tree. \\n\\n\\'What are you saying, Gandalf?\\' asked Pippin. \\n\\n\\'I was just running over some of the Rhymes of Lore in my mind \\' \\nanswered the wizard. \\'Hobbits, I suppose, have forgotten them, even those \\nthat they ever knew.\\' \\n\\n\\'No, not all,\\' said Pippin. \\'And we have many of our own, which \\nwouldn\\'t interest you, perhaps. But I have never heard this one. What is it \\nabout -- the seven stars and seven stones?\\' \\n\\n\\'About the palantnri of the Kings of Old,\\' said Gandalf. \\n\\n\\'And what are they?\\' \\n\\n\\'The name meant that which looks far away. The Orthanc-stone was one.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then it was not made, not made\\' -- Pippin hesitated -- \\'by the Enemy?\\' \\n\\n\\'No,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Nor by Saruman. It is beyond his art, and beyond \\nSauron\\'s too. The palantnri came from beyond Westernesse from Eldamar. \\n\\nThe \\n\\nNoldor made them. Flanor himself, maybe, wrought them, in days so long ago \\nthat the time cannot be measured in years. But there is nothing that Sauron \\ncannot turn to evil uses. Alas for Saruman! It was his downfall, as I now \\nperceive. Perilous to us all are the devices of an art deeper than we \\npossess ourselves. Yet he must bear the blame. Fool! to keep it secret, for \\nhis own profit. No word did he ever speak of it to any of the Council. We \\nhad not yet given thought to the fate of the palantnri of Gondor in its \\nruinous wars. By Men they were almost forgotten. Even in Gondor they were a \\nsecret known only to a few; in Arnor they were remembered only in a rhyme of \\nlore among the D(r)nedain.\\' \\n\\n\\'What did the Men of old use them for?\\' asked Pippin, delighted and \\nastonished at getting answers to so many questions, and wondering how long \\nit would last. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo see far off, and to converse in thought with one another,\\' said \\nGandalf. \\'In that way they long guarded and united the realm of Gondor. They \\nset up Stones at Minas Anor, and at Minas Ithil, and at Orthanc in the ring \\nof Isengard. The chief and master of these was under the Dome of Stars at \\nOsgiliath before its ruin. The three others were far away in the North. In \\nthe house of Elrond it is told that they were at Ann(r)minas, and Amon Syl, \\nand Elendil\\'s Stone was on the Tower Hills that look towards Mithlond in the \\nGulf of Lune where the grey ships lie. \\n\\n\\'Each palantnr replied to each, but all those in Gondor were ever open \\nto the view of Osgiliath. Now it appears that, as the rock of Orthanc has \\nwithstood the storms of time, so there the palantnr of that tower has \\nremained. But alone it could do nothing but see small images of things far \\noff and days remote. Very useful, no doubt, that was to Saruman; yet it \\nseems that he was not content. Further and further abroad he gazed, until he \\ncast his gaze upon Barad-dyr. Then he was caught! \\n\\n\\'Who knows where the lost Stones of Arnor and Gondor now lie buried, or \\ndrowned deep? But one. at least Sauron must have obtained and mastered to \\nhis purposes. I guess that it was the Ithil-stone, for he took Minas Ithil \\nlong ago and turned it into an evil place: Minas Morgul, it has become. \\n\\n\\'Easy it is now to guess how quickly the roving eye of Saruman was \\ntrapped and held; and how ever since he has been persuaded from afar, and \\ndaunted when persuasion would not serve. The biter bit, the hawk under the \\neagle\\'s foot, the spider in a steel web! How long, I wonder, has he been \\nconstrained to come often to his glass for inspection and instruction, and \\nthe Orthanc -stone so bent towards Barad-dyr that, if any save a will of \\nadamant now looks into it, it will bear his mind and sight swiftly thither? \\n\\nAnd how it draws one to itself! Have I not felt it? Even now my heart \\ndesires to test my will upon it, to see if I could not wrench it from him \\nand turn it where I would-to look across the wide seas of water and of time \\nto Tirion the Fair, and perceive the unimaginable hand and mind of Flanor at \\ntheir work, while both the White Tree and the Golden were in flower!\\' He \\nsighed and fell silent. \\n\\n\\'I wish I had known all this before,\\' said Pippin. \\'I had no notion of \\nwhat I was doing.\\' \\n\\n\\'Oh yes, you had,\\' said Gandalf. \\'You knew you were behaving wrongly \\nand foolishly; and you told yourself so, though you did not listen. I did \\nnot tell you all this before, because it is only by musing on all that has \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhappened that I have at last understood, even as we ride together. But if I \\nhad spoken sooner, it would not have lessened your desire, or made it easier \\nto resist. On the contrary! No, the burned hand teaches best. After that \\nadvice about fire goes to the heart.\\' \\n\\n\\'It does,\\' said Pippin. \\'If all the seven stones were laid out before \\nme now, I should shut my eyes and put my hands in my pockets.\\' \\n\\n\\'Good!\\' said Gandalf. \\'That is what I hoped.\\' \\n\\n\\'But I should like to know--\\' Pippin began. \\n\\n\\'Mercy!\\' cried Gandalf. \\'If the giving of information is to be the cure \\nof your inquisitiveness, I shall spend all the rest of my days in answering \\nyou. What more do you want to know?\\' \\n\\n\\'The names of all the stars, and of all living things, and the whole \\nhistory of Middle-earth and Over -heaven and of the Sundering Seas \\' laughed \\nPippin. \\'Of course! What less? But I am notin a hurry tonight. At the \\nmoment I was just wondering about the black shadow. I heard you shout \\n\"messenger of Mordor\". What was it? What could it do at Isengard?\\' \\n\\n\\'It was a Black Rider on wings, a Nazgyl,\\' said Gandalf. \\'It could have \\ntaken you away to the Dark Tower.\\' \\n\\n\\'But it was not coming for me, was it?\\' faltered Pippin. \\'I mean, it \\ndidn\\'t know that I had... \\' \\n\\n\\'Of course not,\\' said Gandalf. \\'It is two hundred leagues or more in \\nstraight flight from Barad-dyr to Orthanc, and even a Nazgyl would take a \\nfew hours to fly between them. But Saruman certainly looked in the Stone \\nsince the ore-raid, and more of his secret thought, I do not doubt, has been \\nread than he intended. A messenger has been sent to find out what he is \\ndoing. And after what has happened tonight another will come, I think, and \\nswiftly. So Saruman will come to the last pinch of the vice that he has put \\nhis hand in. He has no captive to send. He has no Stone to see with, and \\ncannot answer the summons. Sauron will only believe that he is withholding \\nthe captive and refusing to use the Stone. It will not help Saruman to tell \\nthe truth to the messenger. For Isengard may be ruined, yet he is still safe \\nin Orthanc. So whether he will or no, he will appear a rebel. Yet he \\nrejected us, so as to avoid that very thing! What he will do in such a \\nplight, I cannot guess. He has power still, I think, while in Orthanc, to \\nresist the Nine Riders. He may try to do so. He may try to trap the Nazgyl, \\nor at least to slay the thing on which it now rides the air. In that case \\nlet Rohan look to its horses ! \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'But I cannot tell how it will fall out, well or ill for us. It may be \\nthat the counsels of the Enemy will be confused, or hindered by his wrath \\nwith Saruman. It may be that he will learn that I was there and stood upon \\nthe stairs of Orthanc-with hobbits at my tail. Or that an heir of Elendil \\nlives and stood beside me. If Wormtongue was not deceived by the armour of \\nRohan, he would remember Aragorn and the title that he claimed. That is what \\nI fear. And so we fly -- not from danger but into greater danger. Every \\nstride of Shadowfax bears you nearer to the Land of Shadow, Peregrin Took.\\' \\n\\nPippin made no answer, but clutched his cloak, as if a sudden chill had \\nstruck him. Grey land passed under them. \\n\\n\\'See now!\\' said Gandalf. \\'The Westfold dales are opening before us. \\n\\nHere we come back to the eastward road. The dark shadow yonder is the \\nmouth \\n\\nof the Deeping-coomb. That way lies Aglarond and the Glittering Caves. Do \\nnot ask me about them. Ask Gimli, if you meet again, and for the first time \\nyou may get an answer longer than you wish. You will not see the caves \\nyourself, not on this journey. Soon they will be far behind.\\' \\n\\n\\'I thought you were going to stop at Helm\\'s Deep!\\' said Pippin. \\'Where \\nare you going then?\\' \\n\\n\\'To Minas Tirith, before the seas of war surround it.\\' \\n\\n\\'Oh! And how far is that?\\' \\n\\n\\'Leagues upon leagues,\\' answered Gandalf. \\'Thrice as far as the \\ndwellings of King Thjoden, and they are more than a hundred miles east from \\nhere, as the messengers of Mordor fly. Shadowfax must run a longer road. \\nWhich will prove the swifter? \\n\\n\\'We shall ride now till daybreak, and that is some hours away. Then \\neven Shadowfax must rest, in some hollow of the hills: at Edoras, I hope. \\nSleep, if you can! You may see the first glimmer of dawn upon the golden \\nroof of the house of Eorl. And in two days thence you shall see the purple \\nshadow of Mount Mindolluin and the walls of the tower of Denethor white in \\nthe morning. \\n\\n\\'Away now, Shadowfax! Run, greatheart, run as you have never run \\nbefore! Now we are come to the lands where you were foaled and every stone \\nyou know. Run now! Hope is in speed!\\' \\n\\nShadowfax tossed his head and cried aloud, as if a trumpet had summoned \\nhim to battle. Then he sprang forward. Fire flew from his feet; night rushed \\nover him. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs he fell slowly into sleep, Pippin had a strange feeling: he and \\nGandalf were still as stone, seated upon the statue of a running horse, \\nwhile the world rolled away beneath his feet with a great noise of wind. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* BOOK IV * \\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 1. The Taming of Smjagol \\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Well, master, we\\'re in a fix and no mistake,\\' said Sam Gamgee. He \\nstood despondently with hunched shoulders beside Frodo, and peered out with \\npuckered eyes into the gloom. \\n\\nIt was the third evening since they had fled from the Company, as far \\nas they could tell: they had almost lost count of the hours during which \\nthey had climbed and laboured among the barren slopes and stones of the \\nEmyn \\n\\nMuil, sometimes retracing their steps because they could find no way \\nforward, sometimes discovering that they had wandered in a circle back to \\nwhere they had been hours before. Yet on the whole they had worked steadily \\neastward, keeping as near as they could find a way to the outer edge of this \\nstrange twisted knot of hills. But always they found its outward faces \\nsheer, high and impassable, frowning over the plain below; beyond its \\ntumbled skirts lay livid festering marshes where nothing moved and not even \\na bird was to be seen. \\n\\nThe hobbits stood now on the brink of a tall cliff, bare and bleak, its \\nfeet wrapped in mist; and behind them rose the broken highlands crowned with \\ndrifting cloud. A chill wind\\' blew from the East. Night was gathering over \\nthe shapeless lands before them; the sickly green of them was fading to a \\nsullen brown. Far away to the right the Anduin, that had gleamed fitfully in \\nsun-breaks during the day, was now hidden in shadow. But their eyes did not \\nlook beyond the River, back to Gondor, to their friends, to the lands of \\nMen. South and east they stared to where, at the edge of the oncoming night, \\na dark line hung, like distant mountains of motionless smoke. Every now and \\nagain a tiny red gleam far away flickered upwards on the rim of earth and \\nsky. \\n\\n\\'What a fix! \\' said Sam. \\'That\\'s the one place in all the lands we\\'ve \\never heard of that we don\\'t want to see any closer; and that\\'s the one place \\nwe\\'re trying to get to! And that\\'s just where we can\\'t get, nohow. We\\'ve \\ncome the wrong way altogether, seemingly. We can\\'t get down; and if we did \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nget down, we\\'d find all that green land a nasty bog, I\\'ll warrant. Phew! Can \\nyou smell it?\\' He sniffed at the wind. \\n\\n\\'Yes, I can smell it,\\' said Frodo, but he did not move, and his eyes \\nremained fixed, staring out towards the dark line and the flickering flame. \\n\\'Mordor! \\' he muttered under his breath. \\'If I must go there I wish I could \\ncome there quickly and make an end! \\' He shuddered. The wind was chilly and \\nyet heavy with an odour of cold decay. \\'Well,\\' he said, at last withdrawing \\nhis eyes, \\'we cannot stay here all night, fix or no fix. We must find a more \\nsheltered spot, and camp once more; and perhaps another day will show us a \\npath.\\' \\n\\n\\'Or another and another and another,\\' muttered Sam. \\'Or maybe no day. \\nWe\\'ve come the wrong way.\\' \\n\\n\\'I wonder,\\' said Frodo. \\'It\\'s my doom, I think, to go to that Shadow \\nyonder, so that a way will be found. But will good or evil show it to me? \\n\\nWhat hope we had was in speed. Delay plays into the Enemy\\'s hands-and here I \\nam: delayed. Is it the will of the Dark Tower that steers us? All my choices \\nhave proved ill. I should have left the Company long before, and come down \\nfrom the North, east of the River and of the Emyn Muil, and so over the hard \\nof Battle Plain to the passes of Mordor. But now it isn\\'t possible for you \\nand me alone to find a way back, and the Ores are prowling on the east bank. \\nEvery day that passes is a precious day lost. I am tired, Sam. I don\\'t know \\nwhat is to be done. What food have we got left?\\' \\n\\n\\'Only those, what d\\'you call \\'em, lembas, Mr. Frodo. A fair supply. But \\nthey are better than naught, by a long bite. I never thought, though, when I \\nfirst set tooth in them, that I should ever come to wish for a change. But I \\ndo now: a bit of plain bread, and a mug -- aye, half a mug -- of beer would \\ngo down proper. I\\'ve lugged my cooking-gear all the way from the last camp, \\nand what use has it been? Naught to make a fire with, for a start; and \\nnaught to cook, not even grass!\\' \\n\\nThey turned away and went down into a stony hollow. The westering sun \\nwas caught into clouds, and night came swiftly. They slept as well as they \\ncould for the cold, turn and turn about, in a nook among great jagged \\npinnacles of weathered rock; at least they were sheltered from the easterly \\nwind. \\n\\n\\'Did you see them again, Mr. Frodo?\\' asked Sam, as they sat, stiff and \\nchilled, munching wafers of lembas , in the cold grey of early morning. \\n\\n\\'No,\\' said Frodo. \\'I\\'ve heard nothing, and seen nothing, for two nights \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnow.\\' \\n\\n\\'Nor me,\\' said Sam. \\'Grrr! Those eyes did give me a turn! But perhaps \\nwe\\'ve shaken him off at last, the miserable slinker. Gollum! I\\'ll give him \\ngollum in his throat, if ever I get my hands on his neck.\\' \\n\\n\\'I hope you\\'ll never need to,\\' said Frodo. \\'I don\\'t know how he \\nfollowed us; but it may be that he\\'s lost us again, as you say. In this dry \\nbleak land we can\\'t leave many footprints, nor much scent, even for his \\nsnuffling nose.\\' \\n\\n\\'I hope that\\'s the way of it,\\' said Sam. \\'I wish we could be rid of him \\nfor good!\\' \\n\\n\\'So do I,\\' said Frodo; \\'but he\\'s not my chief trouble. I wish we could \\nget away from these hills ! I hate them. I feel all naked on the east side, \\nstuck up here with nothing but the dead flats between me and that Shadow \\nyonder. There\\'s an Eye in it. Come on! We\\'ve got to get down today somehow.\\' \\n\\nBut that day wore on, and when afternoon faded towards evening they \\nwere still scrambling along the ridge and had found no way of escape. \\n\\nSometimes in the silence of that barren country they fancied that they \\nheard faint sounds behind them, a stone falling, or the imagined step of \\nflapping feet on the rock. But if they halted and stood still listening, \\nthey heard no more, nothing but the wind sighing over the edges of the \\nstones -- yet even that reminded them of breath softly hissing through sharp \\nteeth. \\n\\nAll that day the outer ridge of the Emyn Muil had been bending \\ngradually northward, as they struggled on. Along its brink there now \\nstretched a wide tumbled flat of scored and weathered rock, cut every now \\nand again by trench-like gullies that sloped steeply down to deep notches in \\nthe cliff-face. To find a path in these clefts, which were becoming deeper \\nand more frequent, Frodo and Sam were driven to their left, well away from \\nthe edge, and they did not notice that for several miles they had been going \\nslowly but steadily downhill: the cliff-top was sinking towards the level of \\nthe lowlands. \\n\\nAt last they were brought to a halt. The ridge took a sharper bend \\nnorthward and was gashed by a deeper ravine. On the further side it reared \\nup again, many fathoms at a single leap: a great grey cliff loomed before \\nthem, cut sheer down as if by a knife stroke. They could go no further \\nforwards, and must turn now either west or east. But west would lead them \\nonly into more labour and delay, back towards the heart of the hills; east \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwould take them to the outer precipice. \\n\\n\\'There\\'s nothing for it but to scramble down this gully, Sam,\\' said \\nFrodo. \\'Let\\'s see what it leads to!\\' \\n\\n\\'A nasty drop, I\\'ll bet,\\' said Sam. \\n\\nThe cleft was longer and deeper than it seemed. Some way down they \\nfound a few gnarled and stunted trees, the first they had seen for days: \\ntwisted birch for the most part, with here and there a fir-tree. Many were \\ndead and gaunt, bitten to the core by the eastern winds. Once in milder days \\nthere must have been a fair thicket in the ravine, but now, after some fifty \\nyards, the trees came to an end, though old broken stumps straggled on \\nalmost to the cliffs brink. The bottom of the gully, which lay along the \\nedge of a rock-fault, was rough with broken stone and slanted steeply down. \\nWhen they came at last to the end of it, Frodo stooped and leaned out. \\n\\n\\'Look!\\' he said. \\'We must have come down a long way, or else the cliff \\nhas sunk. It\\'s much lower here than it was, and it looks easier too.\\' \\n\\nSam knelt beside him and peered reluctantly over the edge. Then he \\nglanced up at the great cliff rising up, away on their left. \\'Easier! \\' he \\ngrunted. \\'Well, I suppose it\\'s always easier getting down than up. Those as \\ncan\\'t fly can jump!\\' \\n\\n\\'It would be a big jump still,\\' said Frodo. \\'About, well\\' -- he stood \\nfor a moment measuring it with his eyes -- \\'about eighteen fathoms I should \\nguess. Not more.\\' \\n\\n\\'And that\\'s enough! \\' said Sam. \\'Ugh! How I do hate looking down from a \\nheight! But looking\\'s better than climbing.\\' \\n\\n\\'All the same,\\' said Frodo, \\'I think we could climb here; and I think \\nwe shall have to try. See -- the rock is quite different from what it was a \\nfew miles back. It has slipped and cracked.\\' \\n\\nThe outer fall was indeed no longer sheer, but sloped outwards a \\nlittle. It looked like a great rampart or sea-wall whose foundations had \\nshifted, so that its courses were all twisted and disordered, leaving great \\nfissures and long slanting edges that were in places almost as wide as \\nstairs. \\n\\n\\'And if we\\'re going to try and get down, we had better try at once. \\n\\nIt\\'s getting dark early. I think there\\'s a storm coming.\\' \\n\\nThe smoky blur of the mountains in the East was lost in a deeper \\nblackness that was already reaching out westwards with long arms. There was \\na distant mutter of thunder borne on the rising breeze. Frodo sniffed the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nair and looked up doubtfully at the sky. He strapped his belt outside his \\ncloak and tightened it, and settled his light pack on his back; then he \\nstepped towards the edge. \\'I\\'m going to try it,\\' he said. \\n\\n\\'Very good! \\' said Sam gloomily. \\'But I\\'m going first.\\' \\n\\n\\'You? \\' said Frodo. \\'What\\'s made you change your mind about climbing?\\' \\n\\n\\'I haven\\'t changed my mind. But it\\'s only sense: put the one lowest as \\nis most likely to slip. I don\\'t want to come down atop of you and knock you \\noff no sense in killing two with one fall.\\' \\n\\nBefore Frodo could stop him, he sat down, swung his legs over the \\nbrink, and twisted round, scrabbling with his toes for a foothold. It is \\ndoubtful if he ever did anything braver in cold blood, or more unwise. \\n\\n\\'No, no! Sam, you old ass! \\' said Frodo. \\'You\\'ll kill yourself for \\ncertain going over like that without even a look to see what to make for. \\nCome back! \\' He took Sam under the armpits and hauled him up again. \\'Now, \\nwait a bit and be patient! \\' he said. Then he lay on the ground, leaning out \\nand looking down: but the light seemed to be fading quickly, although the \\nsun had not yet set. \\'I think we could manage this,\\' he said presently. \\'I \\ncould at any rate; and you could too. if you kept your head and followed me \\ncarefully.\\' \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know how you can be so sure,\\' said Sam. \\'Why! You can\\'t see to \\nthe bottom in this light. What if you comes to a place where there\\'s nowhere \\nto put your feet or your hands?\\' \\n\\n\\'Climb back, I suppose,\\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'Easy said,\\' objected Sam. \\'Better wait till morning and more light.\\' \\n\\n\\'No! Not if I can help it,\\' said Frodo with a sudden strange vehemence. \\n\\nI grudge every hour, every minute. I\\'m going down to try it out. Don\\'t you \\nfollow till I come back or call!\\' \\n\\nGripping the stony lip of the fall with his fingers he let himself \\ngently down, until when his arms were almost at full stretch, his toes found \\na ledge. \\'On_ e step down! \\' he said. \\'And this ledge broadens out to the \\nright. I could stand there without a hold. I\\'ll--\\' his words were cut short. \\n\\nThe hurrying darkness, now gathering great speed, rushed up from the \\nEast and swallowed the sky. There was a dry splitting crack of thunder right \\noverhead. Searing lightning smote down into the hills. Then came a blast of \\nsavage wind, and with it, mingling with its roar, there came a high shrill \\nshriek. The hobbits had heard just such a cry far away in the Marish as they \\nfled from Hobbiton, and even there in the woods of the Shire it had frozen \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntheir blood. Out here in the waste its terror was far greater: it pierced \\nthem with cold blades of horror and despair, stopping heart and breath. Sam \\nfell flat on his face. Involuntarily Frodo loosed his hold and put his hands \\nover his head and ears. He swayed, slipped, and slithered downwards with a \\nwailing cry. \\n\\nSam heard him and crawled with an effort to the edge. \\'Master, master! \\n\\n\\' he called. \\'Master!\\'. \\n\\nHe heard no answer. He found he was shaking all over, but he gathered \\nhis breath, and once again he shouted: \\'Master!\\' The wind seemed to blow his \\nvoice back into his throat, but as it passed, roaring up the gully and away \\nover the hills, a faint answering cry came to his ears: \\n\\n\\'All right, all right! I\\'m here. But I can\\'t see.\\' \\n\\nFrodo was calling with a weak voice. ,He was not actually very far \\naway. He had slid and not fallen, and had come up with a jolt to his feet on \\na wider ledge not many yards lower down. Fortunately the rock-face at this \\npoint leaned well back and the wind had pressed him against the cliff, so \\nthat he had not toppled over. He steadied himself a little, laying his face \\nagainst the cold stone, feeling his heart pounding. But either the darkness \\nhad grown complete, or else his eyes had lost their sight. All was black \\nabout him. He wondered if he had been struck blind. He took a deep breath. \\n\\n\\'Come back! Come back! \\' he heard Sam\\'s voice out of the blackness \\nabove. \\n\\n\\'I can\\'t,\\' he said. \\'I can\\'t see. I can\\'t find any hold. I can\\'t move \\nyet.\\' \\n\\n\\'What can I do, Mr. Frodo? What can I do? \\' shouted Sam, leaning out \\ndangerously far. Why could not his master see? It was dim, certainly, but \\nnot as dark as all that. He could see Frodo below him, a grey forlorn figure \\nsplayed against the cliff. But he was far out of the reach of any helping \\nhand. \\n\\nThere was another crack of thunder; and then the rain came. In a \\nblinding sheet, mingled with hail, it drove against the cliff, bitter cold. \\n\\nTm coming down to you,\\' shouted Sam, though how he hoped to help in \\nthat way he could not have said. \\n\\n\\'No, no! wait! \\'Frodo called back, more strongly now. \\'I shall be \\nbetter soon. I feel better already. Wait! You can\\'t do anything without a \\nrope.\\' \\n\\n\\'Rope!\\' cried Sam, talking wildly to himself in his excitement and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nrelief. \\'Well, if I don\\'t deserve to be hung on the end of one as a warning \\nto numbskulls! You\\'re nowt but a ninnyhammer, Sam Gamgee: that\\'s what \\nthe \\n\\nGaffer said to me often enough, it being a word of his. Rope!\\' \\n\\n\\'Stop chattering!\\' cried Frodo, now recovered enough to feel both \\namused and annoyed. \\'Never mind your Gaffer! Are you trying to tell yourself \\nyou\\'ve got some rope in your pocket? If so, out with it! \\n\\n\\'Yes, Mr. Frodo, in my pack and all. Carried it hundreds of miles and \\nI\\'d clean forgotten it!\\' \\n\\n\\'Then get busy and let an end down!\\' \\n\\nQuickly Sam unslung his pack and rummaged in it. There indeed at the \\nbottom was a coil of the silken-grey rope made by the folk of Lurien. He \\ncast an end to his master. The darkness seemed to lift from Frodo\\'s eyes, or \\nelse his sight was returning. He could see the grey line as it came dangling \\ndown, and he thought it had a faint silver sheen. Now that he had some point \\nin the darkness to fix his eyes on, he felt less giddy. Leaning his weight \\nforward, he made the end fast round his waist, and then he grasped the line \\nwith both hands. \\n\\nSam stepped back and braced his feet against a stump a yard or two from \\nthe edge. Half hauled, half scrambling. Frodo came up and threw himself on \\nthe ground. \\n\\nThunder growled and rumbled in the distance, and the rain was still \\nfalling heavily. The hobbits crawled away back into the gully; but they did \\nnot find much shelter there. Rills of water began to run down; soon they \\ngrew to a spate that splashed and fumed on the stones, and spouted out over \\nthe cliff like the gutters of a vast roof. \\n\\n\\'I should have been half drowned down there, or washed clean off,\\' said \\nFrodo. \\'What a piece of luck you had that rope!\\' \\n\\n\\'Better luck if I\\'d thought of it sooner,\\' said Sam. \\'Maybe you \\nremember them putting the ropes in the boats, as we started off: in the \\nelvish country. I took a fancy to it, and I stowed a coil in my pack. Years \\nago, it seems. \"It may be a help in many needs,\" he said: Haldir, or one of \\nthose folk. And he spoke right.\\' \\n\\n\\'A pity I didn\\'t think of bringing another length,\\' said Frodo; \\'but I \\nleft the Company in such a hurry and confusion. If only we had enough we \\ncould use it to get down. How long is your rope, I wonder?\\' \\n\\nSam paid it out slowly, measuring it with his arms: \\'Five, ten, twenty, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthirty ells, more or less,\\' he said. \\n\\n\\'Who\\'d have thought it!\\' Frodo exclaimed. \\n\\n\\'Ah! Who would? \\' said Sam. \\'Elves are wonderful folk. It looks a bit \\nthin, but it\\'s tough; and soft as milk to the hand. Packs close too, and as \\nlight as light. Wonderful folk to be sure!\\' \\n\\n\\'Thirty ells! \\' said Frodo considering. \\'I believe it would be enough. \\n\\nIf the storm passes before nightfall, I\\'m going to try it.\\' \\n\\n\\'The rain\\'s nearly given over already,\\' said Sam; \\'but don\\'t you go \\ndoing anything risky in the dim again, Mr. Frodo! And I haven\\'t got over \\nthat shriek on the wind yet, if you have. Like a Black Rider it sounded-but \\none up in the air, if they can fly. I\\'m thinking we\\'d best lay up in this \\ncrack till night\\'s over.\\' \\n\\n\\'And I\\'m thinking that I won\\'t spend a moment longer than I need stuck \\nup on this edge with the eyes of the Dark Country looking over the marshes,\\' \\nsaid Frodo. \\n\\nWith that he stood up and went down to the bottom of the gully again. \\n\\nHe looked out. Clear sky was growing in the East once more. The skirts of \\nthe storm were lifting, ragged and wet, and the main battle had passed to \\nspread its great wings over the Emyn Muil; upon which the dark thought of \\nSauron brooded for a while. Thence it turned, smiting the Vale of Anduin \\nwith hail and lightning, and casting its shadow upon Minas Tirith with \\nthreat of war. Then, lowering in the mountains, and gathering its great \\nspires, it rolled on slowly over Gondor and the skirts of Rohan, until far \\naway the Riders on the plain saw its black towers moving behind the sun, as \\nthey rode into the West. But here, over the desert and the reeking marshes \\nthe deep blue sky of evening opened once more, and a few pallid stars \\nappeared, like small white holes in the canopy above the crescent moon. \\n\\n\\'It\\'s good to be able to see again,\\' said Frodo, breathing deep. \\'Do \\nyou know, I thought for a bit that I had lost my sight? From the lightning \\nor something else worse. I could see nothing, nothing at all, until the grey \\nrope came down. It seemed to shimmer somehow.\\' \\n\\n\\'It does look sort of silver in the dark,\\' said Sam. \\'Never noticed it \\nbefore, though I can\\'t remember as I\\'ve ever had it out since I first stowed \\nit. But if you\\'re so set on climbing, Mr. Frodo, how are you going to use \\nit? Thirty ells, or say, about eighteen fathom: that\\'s no more than your \\nguess at the height of the cliff.\\' \\n\\nFrodo thought for a while. \\'Make it fast to that stump, Sam! \\' he said. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Then I think you shall have your wish this time and go first. I\\'ll lower \\nyou, and you need do no more than use your feet and hands to fend yourself \\noff the rock. Though, if you put your weight on some of the ledges and give \\nme a rest, it will help. When you\\'re down, I\\'ll follow. I feel quite myself \\nagain now.\\' \\n\\n\\'Very well,\\' said Sam heavily. \\'If it must be, let\\'s get it over! \\' He \\ntook up the rope and made it fast over the stump nearest to the brink; then \\nthe other end he tied about his own waist. Reluctantly he turned and \\nprepared to go over the edge a second time. \\n\\nIt did not, however, turn out half as bad as he had expected. The rope \\nseemed to give him confidence, though he shut his eyes more than once when \\nhe looked down between his feet. There was one awkward spot, where there \\nwas \\n\\nno ledge and the wall was sheer and even undercut for a short space; there \\nhe slipped and swung out on the silver line. But Frodo lowered him slowly \\nand steadily, and it was over at last. His chief fear had been that the \\nrope-length would give out while he was still high up, but there was still a \\ngood bight in Frodo\\'s hands, when Sam came to the bottom and called up: \\'I\\'m \\ndown! \\' His voice came up clearly from below, but Frodo could not see him; \\nhis grey elven-cloak had melted into the twilight. \\n\\nFrodo took rather more time to follow him. He had the rope about his \\nwaist and it was fast above, and he had shortened it so that it would pull \\nhim up before he reached the ground; still he did not want to risk a fall, \\nand he had not quite Sam\\'s faith in this slender grey line. He found two \\nplaces, all the same, where he had to trust wholly to it: smooth surfaces \\nwhere there was no hold even for his strong hobbit fingers and the ledges \\nwere far apart. But at last he too was down. \\n\\n\\'Well!\\' he cried. \\'We\\'ve done it! We\\'ve escaped from the Emyn Muil! And \\nnow what next, I wonder? Maybe we shall soon be sighing for good hard rock \\nunder foot again.\\' \\n\\nBut Sam did not answer: he was staring back up the cliff. \\n\\n\\'Ninny hammers! \\' he said. \\'Noodles! My beautiful rope! There it is tied to a \\nstump, and we\\'re at the bottom. Just as nice a little stair for that \\nslinking Gollum as we could leave. Better put up a signpost to say which way \\nwe\\'ve gone! I thought it seemed a bit too easy.\\' \\n\\n\\'If you can think of any way we could have both used the rope and yet \\nbrought it down with us, then you can pass on to me ninnyhammer, or any \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nother name your Gaffer gave you,\\' said Frodo. \\'Climb up and untie it and let \\nyourself down, if you want to!\\' \\n\\nSam scratched his head. \\'No, I can\\'t think how, begging your pardon,\\' \\nhe said. \\'But I don\\'t like leaving it, and that\\'s a fact.\\' He stroked the \\nrope\\'s end and shook it gently. \\'It goes hard parting with anything I \\nbrought out of the Elf-country. Made by Galadriel herself, too, maybe. \\nGaladriel,\\' he murmured nodding his head mournfully. He looked up and gave \\none last pull to the rope as if in farewell. \\n\\nTo the complete surprise of both the hobbits it came loose. Sam fell \\nover, and the long grey coils slithered silently down on top of him. Frodo \\nlaughed. \\'Who tied the rope? \\' he said. \\'A good thing it held as long as it \\ndid! To think that I trusted all my weight to your knot!\\' \\n\\nSam did not laugh. \\'I may not be much good at climbing, Mr. Frodo,\\' he \\nsaid in injured tones, \\'but I do know something about rope and about knots. \\n\\nIt\\'s in the family, as you might say. Why, my grand-dad, and my uncle Andy \\nafter him, him that was the Gaffer\\'s eldest brother he had a rope-walk over \\nby Tighfield many a year. And I put as fast a hitch over the stump as any \\none could have done, in the Shire or out of it.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then the rope must have broken -- frayed on the rock-edge, I expect,\\' \\nsaid Frodo. \\n\\n\\'I bet it didn\\'t! \\' said Sam in an even more injured voice. He stooped \\nand examined the ends. \\'Nor it hasn\\'t neither. Not a strand!\\' \\n\\n\\'Then I\\'m afraid it must have been the knot,\\' said Frodo. \\n\\nSam shook his head and did not answer. He was passing the rope through \\nhis fingers thoughtfully. \\'Have it your own way, Mr. Frodo,\\' he said at \\nlast, \\'but I think the rope came off itself -- when I called.\\' He coiled it \\nup and stowed it lovingly in his pack. \\n\\n\\'It certainly came,\\' said Frodo, \\'and that\\'s the chief thing. But now \\nwe\\'ve got to think of our next move. Night will be on us soon. How beautiful \\nthe stars are, and the Moon!\\' \\n\\n\\'They do cheer the heart, don\\'t they? \\' said Sam looking up. \\'Elvish \\nthey are. somehow. And the Moon\\'s growing. We haven\\'t seen him for a night \\nor two in this cloudy weather. He\\'s beginning to give quite a light.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Frodo; \\'but he won\\'t be full for some days. I don\\'t think \\nwe\\'ll try the marshes by the light of half a moon.\\' \\n\\nUnder the first shadows of night they started out on the next stage of \\ntheir journey. After a while Sam turned and looked back at the way they had \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncome. The mouth of the gully was a black notch in the dim cliff. Tm glad \\nwe\\'ve got the rope,\\' he said. \\'We\\'ve set a little puzzle for that footpad, \\nanyhow. He can try his nasty flappy feet on those ledges!\\' \\n\\nThey picked their steps away from the skirts of the cliff, among a \\nwilderness of boulders and rough stones, wet and slippery with the heavy \\nrain. The ground still fell away sharply. They had not gone very far when \\nthey came upon a great fissure that yawned suddenly black before their feet. \\nIt was not wide, but it was too wide to jump across in the dim light. They \\nthought they could hear water gurgling in its depths. It curved away on \\ntheir left northward, back towards the hills, and so barred their road in \\nthat direction, at any rate while darkness lasted. \\n\\n\\'We had better try a way back southwards along the line of the cliff, I \\nthink,\\' said Sam. \\'We might find some nook there, or even a cave or \\nsomething.\\' \\n\\n\\'I suppose so,\\' said Frodo. Tm tired, and I don\\'t think I can \\nscramble among stones much longer tonight -- though I grudge the delay. I \\nwish there was a clear path in front of us: then I\\'d go on till my legs gave \\nway.\\' \\n\\nThey did not find the going any easier at the broken feet of the Emyn \\nMuil. Nor did Sam find any nook or hollow to shelter in: only bare stony \\nslopes frowned over by the cliff, which now rose again, higher and more \\nsheer as they went back. In the end, worn out, they just cast themselves on \\nthe ground under the lee of a boulder lying not far from the foot of the \\nprecipice. There for some time they sat huddled mournfully together in the \\ncold stony night, while sleep crept upon them in spite of all they could do \\nto hold it off. The moon now rode high and clear. Its thin white light lit \\nup the faces of the rocks and drenched the cold frowning walls of the cliff, \\nturning all the wide looming darkness into a chill pale grey scored with \\nblack shadows. \\n\\n\\'Well! \\' said Frodo, standing up and drawing his cloak more closely \\nround him. \\'You sleep for a bit Sam and take my blanket. I\\'ll walk up and \\ndown on sentry for a while.\\' Suddenly he stiffened, and stooping he gripped \\nSam by the arm. \\'What\\'s that? \\' he whispered. \\'Look over there on the \\ncliff!\\' \\n\\nSam looked and breathed in sharply through his teeth. \\'Ssss!\\' he said. \\n\\'That\\'s what it is. It\\'s that Gollum! Snakes and adders! And to think that I \\nthought that we\\'d puzzle him with our bit of a climb! Look at him! Like a \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnasty crawling spider on a wall.\\' \\n\\nDown the face of a precipice, sheer and almost smooth it seemed in the \\npale moonlight, a small black shape was moving with its thin limbs splayed \\nout. Maybe its soft clinging hands and toes were finding crevices and holds \\nthat no hobbit could ever have seen or used, but it looked as if it was just \\ncreeping down on sticky pads, like some large prowling thing of insect-kind. \\nAnd it was coming down head first, as if it was smelling its way. Now and \\nagain it lifted its head slowly, turning it right back on its long skinny \\nneck, and the hobbits caught a glimpse of two small pale gleaming lights, \\nits eyes that blinked at the moon for a moment and then were quickly lidded \\nagain. \\n\\n\\'Do you think he can see us? \\' said Sam. \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know,\\' said Frodo quietly, \\'but I think not. It is hard even \\nfor friendly eyes to see these elven-cloaks: I cannot see you in the shadow \\neven at a few paces. And I\\'ve heard that he doesn\\'t like Sun or Moon.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then why is he coming down just here? \\' asked Sam. \\n\\n\\'Quietly, Sam! \\' said Frodo. \\'He can smell us, perhaps. And he can hear \\nas keen as Elves, I believe. I think he has heard something now: our voices \\nprobably. We did a lot of shouting away back there; and we were talking far \\ntoo loudly until a minute ago.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, I\\'m sick of him,\\' said Sam. \\'He\\'s come once too often for me and \\nI\\'m going to have a word with him, if I can. I don\\'t suppose we could give \\nhim the slip now anyway.\\' Drawing his grey hood well over his face, Sam \\ncrept stealthily towards the cliff. \\n\\n\\'Careful!\\' whispered Frodo coming behind. \\'Don\\'t alarm him! He\\'s much \\nmore dangerous than he looks.\\' \\n\\nThe black crawling shape was now three-quarters of the way down, and \\nperhaps fifty feet or less above the cliffs foot. Crouching stone-still in \\nthe shadow of a large boulder the hobbits watched him. He seemed to have \\ncome to a difficult passage or to be troubled about something. They could \\nhear him snuffling, and now and again there was a harsh hiss of breath that \\nsounded like a curse. He lifted his head, and they thought they heard him \\nspit. Then he moved on again. Now they could hear his voice creaking and \\nwhistling. \\n\\n\\'Ach, sss! Cautious, my precious! More haste less speed. We musstn\\'t \\nrissk our neck, musst we, precious? No, precious -- golluml\\' He lifted his \\nhead again, blinked at the moon, and quickly shut his eyes. \\'We hate it,\\' he \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhissed. \\'Nassty, nassty shivery light it is -- sss -- it spies on us, \\nprecious -- it hurts our eyes.\\' \\n\\nHe was getting lower now and the hisses became sharper and clearer. \\n\\'Where iss it, where iss it: my Precious, my Precious? It\\'s ours, it is, and \\nwe wants it. The thieves, the thieves, the filthy little thieves. Where are \\nthey with my Precious? Curse them! We hates them.\\' \\n\\n\\'It doesn\\'t sound as if he knew we were here, does it? \\' whispered Sam. \\n\\'And what\\'s his Precious? Does he mean the\\' \\n\\n\\'Hsh! \\' breathed Frodo. \\'He\\'s getting near now, near enough to hear a \\nwhisper.\\' \\n\\nIndeed Gollum had suddenly paused again, and his large head on its \\nscrawny neck was lolling from side to side as if he was listening. His pale \\neyes were half unlidded. Sam restrained himself, though his fingers were \\ntwitching. His eyes, filled with anger and disgust, were fixed on the \\nwretched creature as he now began to move again, still whispering and \\nhissing to himself. \\n\\nAt last he was no more than a dozen feet from the ground, right above \\ntheir heads. From that point there was a sheer drop, for the cliff was \\nslightly undercut, and even Gollum could not find a hold of any kind. He \\nseemed to be trying to twist round, so as to go legs first, when suddenly \\nwith a shrill whistling shriek he fell. As he did so, he curled his legs and \\narms up round him, like a spider whose descending thread is snapped. \\n\\nSam was out of his hiding in a flash and crossed the space between him \\nand the cliff foot in a couple of leaps. Before Gollum could get up, he was \\non top of him. But he found Gollum more than he bargained for, even taken \\nlike that, suddenly, off his guard after a fall. Before Sam could get a \\nhold, long legs and arms were wound round him pinning his arms, and a \\nclinging grip, soft but horribly strong, was squeezing him like slowly \\ntightening cords; clammy fingers were feeling for his throat. Then sharp \\nteeth bit into his shoulder. All he could do was to butt his hard round head \\nsideways into the creature\\'s face. Gollum hissed and spat, but he did not \\nlet go. \\n\\nThings would have gone ill with Sam, if he had been alone. But Frodo \\nsprang up, and drew Sting from its sheath. With his left hand he drew back \\nGollum\\'s head by his thin lank hair, stretching his long neck, and forcing \\nhis pale venomous eyes to stare up at the sky. \\n\\n\\'Let go! Gollum,\\' he said. \\'This is Sting. You have seen it before once \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nupon a time. Let go, or you\\'ll feel it this time! I\\'ll cut your throat.\\' \\n\\nGollum collapsed and went as loose as wet string. Sam got up, fingering \\nhis shoulder. His eyes smouldered with anger, but he could not avenge \\nhimself: his miserable enemy lay grovelling on the stones whimpering. \\n\\n\\'Don\\'t hurt us! Don\\'t let them hurt us, precious! They won\\'t hurt us \\nwill they, nice little hobbitses? We didn\\'t mean no harm, but they jumps on \\nus like cats on poor mices, they did, precious. And we\\'re so lonely, gollum. \\nWe\\'ll be nice to them, very nice, if they\\'ll be nice to us, won\\'t we, yes, \\nyess.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, what\\'s to be done with it? \\' said Sam. \\'Tie it up, so as it \\ncan\\'t come sneaking after us no more, I say.\\' \\n\\n\\'But that would kill us, kill us,\\' whimpered Gollum. \\'Cruel little \\nhobbitses. Tie us up in the cold hard lands and leave us, gollum, gollum.\\' \\nSobs welled up in his gobbling throat. \\n\\n\\'No,\\' said Frodo. \\'If we kill him, we must kill him outright. But we \\ncan\\'t do that, not as things are. Poor wretch! He has done us no harm.\\' \\n\\n\\'Oh hasn\\'t he! \\' said Sam rubbing his shoulder. \\'Anyway he meant to, \\nand he means to, I\\'ll warrant. Throttle us in our sleep, that\\'s his plan.\\' \\n\\n\\'I daresay,\\' said Frodo. \\'But what he means to do is another matter.\\' \\n\\nHe paused for a while in thought. Gollum lay still, but stopped whimpering. \\nSam stood glowering over him. \\n\\nIt seemed to Frodo then that he heard, quite plainly but far off, \\nvoices out of the past: \\n\\nWhat a pity Bilbo did not stub the vile creature, when he had a chance! \\n\\nPity? It was Pity that stayed his hand. Pity, and Mercy: not to strike \\nwithout need. \\n\\nI do not feel any pity for Gollum. He deserves death. \\n\\nDeserves death! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And \\nsome die that deserve life. Can you give that to them? Then be not too eager \\nto deal out death in the name of justice, fearing for your own safety. Even \\nthe wise cannot see all ends. \\n\\n\\'Very well,\\' he answered aloud, lowering his sword. \\'But still I am \\nafraid. And yet, as you see, I will not touch the creature. For now that I \\nsee him, I do pity him.\\' \\n\\nSam stared at his master, who seemed to be speaking to some one who was \\nnot there. Gollum lifted his head. \\n\\n\\'Yess, wretched we are, precious,\\' he whined. \\'Misery misery! Hobbits \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwon\\'t kill us, nice hobbits.\\' \\n\\n\\'No, we won\\'t,\\' said Frodo. \\'But we won\\'t let you go, either. You\\'re \\nfull of wickedness and mischief, Gollum. You will have to come with us, \\nthat\\'s all, while we keep an eye on you. But you must help us, if you can. \\n\\nOne good turn deserves another.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yess, yes indeed,\\' said Gollum sitting up. \\'Nice hobbits! We will come \\nwith them. Find them safe paths in the dark, yes we will. And where are they \\ngoing in these cold hard lands, we wonders, yes we wonders? \\' He looked up \\nat them, and a faint light of cunning and eagerness flickered for a second \\nin his pale blinking eyes. \\n\\nSam scowled at him, and sucked his teeth; but he seemed to sense that \\nthere was something odd about his master\\'s mood and that the matter was \\nbeyond argument. All the same he was amazed at Frodo\\'s reply. \\n\\nFrodo looked straight into Gollum\\'s eyes which flinched and twisted \\naway. \\'You know that, or you guess well enough, Smjagol,\\' he said, quietly \\nand sternly. \\'We are going to Mordor, of course. And you know the way there, \\nI believe.\\' \\n\\n\\'Ach! sss! \\' said Gollum, covering his ears with his hands, as if such \\nfrankness, and the open speaking of the names, hurt him. \\'We guessed, yes we \\nguessed,\\' he whispered; \\'and we didn\\'t want them to go, did we? No, \\nprecious, not the nice hobbits. Ashes, ashes, and dust, and thirst there is; \\nand pits, pits, pits, and Ores, thousands of Orcses. Nice hobbits mustn\\'t go \\nto -- sss -- those places.\\' \\n\\n\\'So you have been there? \\' Frodo insisted. \\'And you\\'re being drawn back \\nthere, aren\\'t you?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yess. Yess. No! \\' shrieked Gollum. \\'Once, by accident it was, wasn\\'t \\nit, precious? Yes, by accident. But we won\\'t go back, no, no!\\' Then suddenly \\nhis voice and language changed, and he sobbed in his throat, and spoke but \\nnot to them. \\'Leave me alone, golluml You hurt me. O my poor hands, gollum \\nI, we, I don\\'t want to come back. I can\\'t find it. I am tired. I, we can\\'t \\nfind it, gollum, gollum, no, nowhere. They\\'re always awake. Dwarves, Men, \\nand Elves, terrible Elves with bright eyes. I can\\'t find it. Ach! \\' He got \\nup and clenched his long hand into a bony fleshless knot, shaking it towards \\nthe East. \\'We won\\'t! \\' he cried. \\'Not for you.\\' Then he collapsed again. \\n\\'Gollum, gollum,\\' he whimpered with his face to the ground. \\'Don\\'t look at \\nus! Go away! Go to sleep!\\' \\n\\n\\'He will not go away or go to sleep at your command, Smjagol,\\' said \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrodo. \\'But if you really wish to be free of him again, then you must help \\nme. And that I fear means finding us a path towards him. But you need not go \\nall the way, not beyond the gates of his land.\\' \\n\\nGollum sat up again and looked at him under his eyelids. \\'He\\'s over \\nthere,\\' he cackled. \\'Always there. Ores will take you all the way. Easy to \\nfind Ores east of the River. Don\\'t ask Smjagol. Poor, poor Smjagol, he went \\naway long ago. They took his Precious, and he\\'s lost now.\\' \\n\\n\\'Perhaps we\\'ll find him again, if you come with us,\\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'No, no, never! He\\'s lost his Precious,\\' said Gollum. \\n\\n\\'Get up! \\' said Frodo. \\n\\nGollum stood up and backed away against the cliff. \\n\\n\\'Now! \\' said Frodo. \\'Can you find a path easier by day or by night? \\n\\nWe\\'re tired; but if you choose the night, we\\'ll start tonight.\\' \\n\\n\\'The big lights hurt our eyes, they do,\\' Gollum whined. \\'Not under the \\nWhite Face, not yet. It will go behind the hills soon, yess. Rest a bit \\nfirst, nice hobbits!\\' \\n\\n\\'Then sit down,\\' said Frodo, \\'and don\\'t move!\\' \\n\\nThe hobbits seated themselves beside him, one on either side, with \\ntheir backs to the stony wall, resting their legs. There was no need for any \\narrangement by word: they knew that they must not sleep for a moment. Slowly \\nthe moon went by. Shadows fell down from the hills, and all grew dark before \\nthem. The stars grew thick and bright in the sky above. No one stirred. \\nGollum sat with his legs drawn up, knees under chin, flat hands and feet \\nsplayed on the ground, his eyes closed; but he seemed tense, as if thinking \\nor listening. \\n\\nFrodo looked across at Sam. Their eyes met and they understood. They \\nrelaxed, leaning their heads back, and shutting their eyes or seeming to. \\n\\nSoon the sound of their soft breathing could be heard. Gollum\\'s hands \\ntwitched a little. Hardly perceptibly his head moved to the left and the \\nright, and first one eye and then the other opened a slit. The hobbits made \\nno sign. \\n\\nSuddenly, with startling agility and speed, straight off the ground \\nwith a jump like a grasshopper or a frog. Gollum bounded forward into the \\ndarkness. But that was just what Frodo and Sam had expected. Sam was on \\nhim \\n\\nbefore he had gone two paces after his spring. Frodo coming behind grabbed \\nhis leg and threw him. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Your rope might prove useful again, Sam.\\' he said. \\n\\nSam got out the rope. \\'And where were you off to in the cold hard \\nlands, Mr. Gollum?\\' he growled. \\'We wonders, aye, we wonders. To find \\nsome \\n\\nof your ore-friends, I warrant. You nasty treacherous creature. It\\'s round \\nyour neck this rope ought to go, and a tight noose too.\\' \\n\\nGollum lay quiet and tried no further tricks. He did not answer Sam, \\nbut gave him a swift venomous look. \\n\\n\\'All we need is something to keep a hold on him,\\' said Frodo. \\'We want \\nhim to walk, so it\\'s no good tying his legs-or his arms, he seems to use \\nthem nearly as much. Tie one end to his ankle, and keep a grip on the other \\nend.\\' \\n\\nHe stood over Gollum, while Sam tied the knot. The result surprised \\nthem both. Gollum began to scream, a thin, tearing sound, very horrible to \\nhear. He writhed, and tried to get his mouth to his ankle and bite the rope. \\n\\nHe kept on screaming. \\n\\nAt last Frodo was convinced that he really was in pain; but it could \\nnot be from the knot. He examined it and found that it was not too tight, \\nindeed hardly tight enough. Sam was gentler than his words. \\'What\\'s the \\nmatter with you? \\' he said. \\'If you will try to run away, you must be tied; \\nbut we don\\'t wish to hurt you.\\' \\n\\n\\'It hurts us, it hurts us,\\' hissed Gollum. \\'It freezes, it bites! Elves \\ntwisted it, curse them! Nasty cruel hobbits! That\\'s why we tries to escape, \\nof course it is, precious. We guessed they were cruel hobbits. They visits \\nElves, fierce Elves with bright eyes. Take it off us! It hurts us.\\' \\n\\n\\'No, I will not take it off you,\\' said Frodo, \\'not unless\\' -- he paused \\na moment in thought -- \\'not unless there is any promise you can make that I \\ncan trust.\\' \\n\\n\\'We will swear to do what he wants, yes, yess, said Gollum, still \\ntwisting and grabbling at his ankle. \\'It hurts us.\\' \\n\\n\\'Swear? \\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'Smjagol,\\' said Gollum suddenly and clearly, opening his eyes wide and \\nstaring at Frodo with a strange light. \\'Smjagol will swear on the Precious.\\' \\n\\nFrodo drew himself up, and again Sam was startled by his words and his \\nstern voice. \\'On the Precious? How dare you? \\' he said. \\'Think! \\n\\nOne Ring to rule them all and in the Darkness bind them. \\n\\nWould you commit your promise to that, Smjagol? It will hold you. But \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nit is more treacherous than you are. It may twist your words. Beware!\\' \\n\\nGollum cowered. \\'On the Precious, on the Precious! \\' he repeated. \\n\\n\\'And what would you swear? \\' asked Frodo. \\n\\n\\'To be very very good,\\' said Gollum. Then crawling to Frodo\\'s feet he \\ngrovelled before him, whispering hoarsely: a shudder ran over him, as if the \\nwords shook his very bones with fear. \\'Smjagol will swear never, never, to \\nlet Him have it. Never! Smjagol will save it. But he must swear on the \\nPrecious.\\' \\n\\n\\'No! not on it,\\' said Frodo, looking down at him with stern pity. \\'All \\nyou wish is to see it and touch it, if you can, though you know it would \\ndrive you mad. Not on it. Swear by it, if you will. For you know where it \\nis. Yes, you know, Smjagol. It is before you.\\' \\n\\nFor a moment it appeared to Sam that his master had grown and Gollum \\nhad shrunk: a tall stern shadow, a mighty lord who hid his brightness in \\ngrey cloud, and at his feet a little whining dog. Yet the two were in some \\nway akin and not alien: they could reach one another\\'s minds. Gollum raised \\nhimself and began pawing at Frodo, fawning at his knees. \\n\\n\\'Down! down! \\' said Frodo. \\'Now speak your promise!\\' \\n\\n\\'We promises, yes I promise!\\' said Gollum. \\'I will serve the master of \\nthe Precious. Good master, good Smjagol, gollum, gollumY Suddenly he began \\nto weep and bite at his ankle again. \\n\\n\\'Take the rope off, Sam!\\' said Frodo. \\n\\nReluctantly Sam obeyed. At once Gollum got up and began prancing about, \\nlike a whipped cur whose master has patted it. From that moment a change, \\nwhich lasted for some time, came over him. He spoke with less hissing and \\nwhining, and he spoke to his companions direct, not to his precious self. He \\nwould cringe and flinch, if they stepped near him or made any sudden \\nmovement, and he avoided the touch of their elven-cloaks; but he was \\nfriendly, and indeed pitifully anxious to please. He would cackle with \\nlaughter and caper, if any jest was made, or even if Frodo spoke kindly to \\nhim, and weep if Frodo rebuked him. Sam said little to him of any sort. He \\nsuspected him more deeply than ever, and if possible liked the new Gollum, \\nthe Smjagol, less than the old. \\n\\n\\'Well, Gollum, or whatever it is we\\'re to call you,\\' he said, \\'now for \\nit! The Moon\\'s gone, and the night\\'s going. We\\'d better start.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, yes,\\' agreed Gollum, skipping about. \\'Off we go! There\\'s only one \\nway across between the North-end and the South-end. I found it, I did. Ores \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndon\\'t use it, Ores don\\'t know it. Ores don\\'t cross the Marshes, they go \\nround for miles and miles. Very lucky you came this way. Very lucky you \\nfound Smjagol, yes. Follow Smjagol!\\' \\n\\nHe took a few steps away and looked back inquiringly, like a dog \\ninviting them for a walk. \\'Wait a bit, Gollum!\\' cried Sam. \\'Not too far \\nahead now! I\\'m going to be at your tail, and I\\'ve got the rope handy.\\' \\n\\n\\'No, no! \\' said Gollum. \\'Smjagol promised.\\' \\n\\nIn the deep of night under hard clear stars they set off. Gollum led \\nthem back northward for a while along the way they had come; then he slanted \\nto the right away from the steep edge of the Emyn Muil, down the broken \\nstony slopes towards the vast fens below. They faded swiftly and softly into \\nthe darkness. Over all the leagues of waste before the gates of Mordor there \\nwas a black silence. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 2 . The Passage of the Marshes \\n\\n\\n\\nGollum moved quickly, with his head and neck thrust forward, often \\nusing his hands as well as his feet. Frodo and Sam were hard put to it to \\nkeep up with him; but he seemed no longer to have any thought of escaping, \\nand if they fell behind, he would turn and wait for them. After a time he \\nbrought them to the brink of the narrow gully that they had struck before; \\nbut they were now further from the hills. \\n\\n\\'Here it is!\\' he cried. \\'There is a way down inside, yes. Now we \\nfollows it -- out, out away over there.\\' He pointed south and east towards \\nthe marshes. The reek of them came to their nostrils, heavy and foul even in \\nthe cool night air. . \\n\\nGollum cast up and down along the brink, and at length he called to \\nthem. \\'Here! We can get down here. Smjagol went this way once: I went this \\nway, hiding from Ores.\\' \\n\\nHe led the way, and following him the hobbits climbed down into the \\ngloom. It was not difficult, for the rift was at this point only some \\nfifteen feet deep and about a dozen across. There was running water at the \\nbottom: it was in fact the bed of one of the many small rivers that trickled \\ndown from the hills to feed the stagnant pools and mires beyond. Gollum \\nturned to the right, southward more or less, and splashed along with his \\nfeet in the shallow stony stream. He seemed greatly delighted to feel the \\nwater, and chuckled to himself, sometimes even croaking in a sort of song. \\n\\nThe cold hard lands, \\nthey bites our hands, \\nthey gnaws our feet. \\n\\nThe rocks and stones \\nare like old bones \\nall bare of meat. \\n\\nBut stream and pool \\nis wet and cool: \\nso nice for feet! \\n\\nAnd now we wish -- \\n\\n\\'Ha! ha! What does we wish?\\' he said, looking sidelong at the hobbits. \\n\\'We\\'ll tell you.\\' he croaked. \\'He guessed it long ago, Baggins guessed it.\\' \\n\\nA glint came into his eyes, and Sam catching the gleam in the darkness \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthought it far from pleasant. \\n\\nAlive without breath; \\nas cold as death; \\nnever thirsting, ever drinking; \\nclad in mail, never clinking. \\n\\nDrowns on dry land, \\nthinks an island \\nis a mountain; \\nthinks a fountain \\nis a puff of air. \\n\\nSo sleek, so fair! \\n\\nWhat a joy to meet! \\n\\nWe only wish \\nto catch a fish, \\nso juicy-sweet! \\n\\nThese words only made more pressing to Sam\\'s mind a problem that had \\nbeen troubling him from the moment when he understood that hir master was \\ngoing to adopt Gollum as a guide: the problem of food. It did not occur to \\nhim that his master might also have thought of it. hut he supposed Gollum \\nhad. Indeed how had Gollum kept himself in all his lonely wandering? \\'Not \\ntoo well,\\' thought Sam. \\'He looks fair famished. Not too dainty to try what \\nhobbit tastes like if there ain\\'t no fish, I\\'ll wager -- supposing as he \\ncould catch us napping. Well, he won\\'t: not Sam Gamgee for one.\\' \\n\\nThey stumbled along in the dark winding gully for a long time, or so it \\nseemed to the tired feet of Frodo and Sam. The gully turned eastward, and as \\nthey went on it broadened and got gradually shallower. At last the sky above \\ngrew faint with the first grey of morning. Gollum had shown no signs of \\ntiring, but now he looked up and halted. \\n\\n\\'Day is near,\\' he whispered, as if Day was something that might \\noverhear him and spring on him. \\'Smjagol will stay here: I will stay here, \\nand the Yellow Face won\\'t see me.\\' \\n\\n\\'We should be glad to see the Sun;\\' said Frodo, \\'but we will stay here: \\nwe are too tired to go any further at present.\\' \\n\\n\\'You are not wise to be glad of the Yellow Face,\\' said Gollum. \\'It \\nshows you up. Nice sensible hobbits stay with Smjagol. Ores and nasty things \\nare about. They can see a long way. Stay and hide with me! \\' \\n\\nThe three of them settled down to rest at the foot of the rocky wall of \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe gully. It was not much more than a tall man\\'s height now, and at its \\nbase there were wide flat shelves of dry stone; the water ran in a channel \\non the other side. Frodo and Sam sat on one of the flats, resting their \\nbacks. Gollum paddled and scrabbled in the stream. \\n\\n\\'We must take a little food,\\' said Frodo. \\'Are you hungry, Smjagol? We \\nhave very little to share, but we will spare you what we can.\\' \\n\\nAt the word hungry a greenish light was kindled in Gollum\\'s pale eyes, \\nand they seemed to protrude further than ever from his thin sickly face. For \\na moment he relapsed into his old Gollum-manner. \\'We are famisshed, yes \\nfamisshed we are. precious,\\' he said. \\'What is it they eats? Have they nice \\nfisshes? \\' His tongue lolled out between his sharp yellow teeth, licking his \\ncolourless lips. \\n\\n\\'No, we have got no fish,\\' said Frodo. \\'We have only got this\\' -- he \\nheld up a wafer of lembas -- \\'and water, if the water here is fit to drink.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yess, yess, nice water,\\' said Gollum. \\'Drink it, drink it, while we \\ncan! But what is it they\\'ve got, precious? Is it crunchable? Is it tasty? \\' \\n\\nFrodo broke off a portion of a wafer and handed it to him on its \\nleaf- wrapping. Gollum sniffed at the leaf and his face changed: a spasm of \\ndisgust came over it, and a hint of his old malice. \\'Smjagol smells it! \\'he \\nsaid. \\'Leaves out of the elf-country, gah! They stinks. He climbed in those \\ntrees, and he couldn\\'t wash the smell off his hands, my nice hands.\\' \\nDropping the leaf, he took a corner of the lembas and nibbled it. He spat, \\nand a fit of coughing shook him. \\n\\n\\'Ach! No! \\' he spluttered. \\'You try to choke poor Smjagol. Dust and \\nashes, he can\\'t eat that. He must starve. But Smjagol doesn\\'t mind. Nice \\nhobbits! Smjagol has promised. He will starve. He can\\'t eat hobbits\\' food. \\n\\nHe will starve. Poor thin Smjagol! \\' \\n\\n\\'I\\'m sorry,\\' said Frodo; \\'but I can\\'t help you, I\\'m afraid. I think \\nthis food would do you good, if you would try. But perhaps you can\\'t even \\ntry, not yet anyway.\\' \\n\\nThe hobbits munched their lembas in silence. Sam thought that it tasted \\nfar better, somehow, than it had for a good while: Gollum\\'s behaviour had \\nmade him attend to its flavour again. But he did not feel comfortable. \\nGollum watched every morsel from hand to mouth, like an expectant dog by \\ndiner\\'s chair. Only when they had finished and were preparing to rest, was \\nhe apparently convinced that they had no hidden dainties that he could share \\nin. Then he went and sat by himself a few paces away and whimpered a little. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Look here! \\' Sam whispered to Frodo, not too softly: he did not really \\ncare whether Gollum heard him or not. \\'We\\'ve got to get some sleep; but not \\nboth together with that hungry villain nigh, promise or no promise. Smjagol \\nor Gollum, he won\\'t change his habits in a hurry, I\\'ll warrant. You go to \\nsleep, Mr. Frodo, and I\\'ll call you when I can\\'t keep my eyelids propped up. \\nTurn and about, same as before, while he\\'s loose.\\' \\n\\n\\'Perhaps you\\'re right, Sam,\\' said Frodo speaking openly. \\'There is a \\nchange in him, but just what kind of a change and how deep, I\\'m not sure \\nyet. Seriously though, I don\\'t think there is any need for fear -- at \\npresent. Still watch if you wish. Give me about two hours, not more, and \\nthen call me.\\' \\n\\nSo tired was Frodo that his head fell forward on his breast and he \\nslept, almost as soon as he had spoken the words. Gollum seemed no longer to \\nhave any fears. He curled up and went quickly to sleep, quite unconcerned. \\nPresently his breath was hissing softly through his clenched teeth, hut he \\nlay still as stone. After a while, fearing that he would drop off himself, \\nif he sat listening to his two companions breathing, Sam got up and gently \\nprodded Gollum. His hands uncurled and twitched, but he made no other \\nmovement. Sam bent down and said fissh close to his ear, but there was no \\nresponse, not even a catch in Gollum\\'s breathing. \\n\\nSam scratched his head. \\'Must really be asleep,\\' he muttered. \\'And if I \\nwas like Gollum, he wouldn\\'t wake up never again.\\' He restrained the \\nthoughts of his sword and the rope that sprang to his mind, and went and sat \\ndown by his master. \\n\\nWhen he woke up the sky above was dim, not lighter but darker than when \\nthey had breakfasted. Sam leapt to his feet. Not least from his own feeling \\nof vigour and hunger, he suddenly understood that he had slept the daylight \\naway, nine hours at least. Frodo was still fast asleep, lying now stretched \\non his side. Gollum was not to be seen. Various reproachful names for \\nhimself came to Sam\\'s mind, drawn from the Gaffer\\'s large paternal \\nword-hoard; then it also occurred to him that his master had been right: \\nthere had for the present been nothing to guard against. They were at any \\nrate both alive and unthrottled. \\n\\n\\'Poor wretch! \\' he said half remorsefully. \\'Now I wonder where he\\'s got \\nto? \\' \\n\\n\\'Not far, not far! \\' said a voice above him. He looked up and saw the \\nshape of Gollum\\'s large head and ears against the evening sky. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Here, what are you doing? \\' cried Sam, his suspicions coming back as \\nsoon as he saw that shape. \\n\\n\\'Smjagol is hungry,\\' said Gollum. \\'Be back soon.\\' \\n\\n\\'Come back now!\\' shouted Sam. \\'Hi! Come back!\\' But Gollum had vanished. \\n\\nFrodo woke at the sound of Sam\\'s shout and sat up, rubbing his eyes. \\n\\'Hullo!\\' he said. \\'Anything wrong? What\\'s the time?\\' \\n\\n\\'I dunno,\\' said Sam. \\'After sundown, I reckon. And he\\'s gone off. Says \\nhe\\'s hungry.\\' \\n\\n\\'Don\\'t worry!\\' said Frodo. \\'There\\'s no help for it. But he\\'ll come \\nback, you\\'ll see. The promise will hold yet a while. And he won\\'t leave his \\nPrecious, anyway.\\' \\n\\nFrodo made light of it when he learned that they had slept soundly for \\nhours with Gollum, and a very hungry Gollum too, loose beside them. \\'Don\\'t \\nthink of any of your Gaffer\\'s hard names,\\' he said. \\'You were worn out, and \\nit has turned out well: we are now both rested. And we have a hard road \\nahead, the worst road of all.\\' \\n\\n\\'About the food,\\' said Sam. \\'How long\\'s it going to take us to do this \\njob? And when it\\'s done, what are we going to do then? This waybread keeps \\nyou on your legs in a wonderful way, though it doesn\\'t satisfy the innards \\nproper, as you might say: not to my feeling anyhow, meaning no disrespect to \\nthem as made it. But you have to eat some of it every day, and it doesn\\'t \\ngrow. I reckon we\\'ve got enough to last, say, three weeks or so, and that \\nwith a tight belt and a light tooth, mind you. We\\'ve been a bit free with it \\nso far.\\' \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know how long we shall take to -- to finish,\\' said Frodo. \\'We \\nwere miserably delayed in the hills. But Samwise Gamgee, my dear hobbit -- \\nindeed, Sam my dearest hobbit, friend of friends -- I do not think we need \\ngive thought to what comes after that. To do the job as you put it -- what \\nhope is there that we ever shall? And if we do, who knows what will come of \\nthat? If the One goes into the Fire, and we are at hand? I ask you, Sam, are \\nwe ever likely to need bread again? I think not. If we can nurse our limbs \\nto bring us to Mount Doom, that is all we can do. More than I can, I begin \\nto feel.\\' \\n\\nSam nodded silently. He took his master\\'s hand and bent over it. He did \\nnot kiss it, though his tears fell on it. Then he turned away, drew his \\nsleeve over his nose, and got up, and stamped about, trying to whistle, and \\nsaying between the efforts: \\'Where\\'s that dratted creature?\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was actually not long before Gollum returned; but he came so quietly \\nthat they did not hear him till he stood before them. His fingers and face \\nwere soiled with black mud. He was still chewing and slavering. What he was \\nchewing, they did not ask or like to think. \\n\\n\\'Worms or beetles or something slimy out of holes,\\' thought Sam. \\'Brr! \\n\\nThe nasty creature; the poor wretch! \\' \\n\\nGollum said nothing to them, until he had drunk deeply and washed \\nhimself in the stream. Then he came up to them, licking his lips. \\'Better \\nnow,\\' he said. \\'Are we rested? Ready to go on? Nice hobbits, they sleep \\nbeautifully. Trust Smjagol now? Very, very good.\\' \\n\\nThe next stage of their journey was much the same as the last. As they \\nwent on the gully became ever shallower and the slope of its floor more \\ngradual. Its bottom was less stony and more earthy, and slowly its sides \\ndwindled to mere banks. It began to wind and wander. That night drew to its \\nend, but clouds were now over moon and star, and they knew of the coming of \\nday only by the slow spreading of the thin grey light. \\n\\nIn a chill hour they came to the end of the water -course. The banks \\nbecame moss-grown mounds. Over the last shelf of rotting stone the stream \\ngurgled and fell down into a brown bog and was lost. Dry reeds hissed and \\nrattled though they could feel no wind. \\n\\nOn either side and in front wide fens and mires now lay, stretching \\naway southward and eastward into the dim half-light. Mists curled and smoked \\nfrom dark and noisome pools. The reek of them hung stifling in the still \\nair. Far away, now almost due south, the mountain-walls of Mordor loomed, \\nlike a black bar of rugged clouds floating above a dangerous fog-bound sea. \\n\\nThe hobbits were now wholly in the hands of Gollum. They did now know, \\nand could not guess in that misty light, that they were in fact only just \\nwithin the northern borders of the marshes, the main expanse of which lay \\nsouth of them. They could, if they had known the lands, with some delay have \\nretraced their steps a little, and then turning east have come round over \\nhard roads to the bare plain of Dagorlad: the field of the ancient battle \\nbefore the gates of Mordor. Not that there was great hope in such a course. \\n\\nOn that stony plain there was no cover, and across it ran the highways of \\nthe Ores and the soldiers of the Enemy. Not even the cloaks of Lurien would \\nhave concealed them there. \\n\\n\\'How do we shape our course now, Smjagol? \\' asked Frodo. \\'Must we cross \\nthese evil-smelling fens? \\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'No need, no need at all,\\' said Gollum. \\'Not if hobbits want to reach \\nthe dark mountains and go to see Him very quick. Back a little, and round a \\nlittle\\' -- his skinny arm waved north and east -- \\'and you can come on hard \\ncold roads to the very gates of His country. Lots of His people will be \\nthere looking out for guests, very pleased to take them straight to Him, O \\nyes. His Eye watches that way all the time. It caught Smjagol there, long \\nago.\\' Gollum shuddered. \\'But Smjagol has used his eyes since then, yes, yes: \\nI\\'ve used eyes and feet and nose since then. 1 know other ways. More \\ndifficult, not so quick; but better, if we don\\'t want Him to see. Follow \\nSmjagol! He can take you through the marshes, through the mists, nice thick \\nmists. Follow Smjagol very carefully, and you may go a long way. quite a \\nlong way, before He catches you, yes perhaps.\\' \\n\\nIt was already day, a windless and sullen morning, and the marsh-reeks \\nlay in heavy banks. No sun pierced the low clouded sky, and Gollum seemed \\nanxious to continue the journey at once. So after a brief rest they set out \\nagain and were soon lost in a shadowy silent world, cut off from all view of \\nthe lands about, either the hills that they had left or the mountains that \\nthey sought. They went slowly in single file: Gollum, Sam, Frodo. \\n\\nFrodo seemed the most weary of the three, and slow though they went, he \\noften lagged. The hobbits soon found that what had looked like one vast fen \\nwas really an endless network of pools, and soft mires, and winding \\nhalf- strangled water -courses. Among these a cunning eye and foot could \\nthread a wandering path. Gollum certainly had that cunning, and needed all \\nof it. His head on its long neck was ever turning this way and that, while \\nhe sniffed and muttered all the time to himself. Sometimes he would hold up \\nhis hand and halt them, while he went forward a little, crouching, testing \\nthe ground with fingers or toes, or merely listening with one ear pressed to \\nthe earth. \\n\\nIt was dreary and wearisome. Cold clammy winter still held sway in this \\nforsaken country. The only green was the scum of livid weed on the dark \\ngreasy surfaces of the sullen waters. Dead grasses and rotting reeds loomed \\nup in the mists like ragged shadows of long-forgotten summers. \\n\\nAs the day wore on the light increased a little, and the mists lifted, \\ngrowing thinner and more transparent. Far above the rot and vapours of the \\nworld the Sun was riding high and golden now in a serene country with floors \\nof dazzling foam, but only a passing ghost of her could they see below, \\nbleared, pale, giving no colour and no warmth. But even at this faint \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nreminder of her presence Gollum scowled and flinched. He halted their \\njourney, and they rested, squatting like little hunted animals, in the \\nborders of a great brown reed-thicket. There was a deep silence, only \\nscraped on its surfaces by the faint quiver of empty seed-plumes, and broken \\ngrass-blades trembling in small air -movements that they could not feel. \\n\\n\\'Not a bird! \\' said Sam mournfully. \\n\\n\\'No, no birds,\\' said Gollum. \\'Nice birds! \\' He licked his teeth. \\'No \\nbirds here. There are snakeses, wormses, things in the pools. Lots of \\nthings, lots of nasty things. No birds,\\' he ended sadly. Sam looked at him \\nwith distaste. \\n\\nSo passed the third day of their journey with Gollum. Before the \\nshadows of evening were long in happier lands, they went on again, always on \\nand on with only brief halts. These they made not so much for rest as to \\nhelp Gollum; for now even he had to go forward with great care, and he was \\nsometimes at a loss for a while. They had come to the very midst of the Dead \\nMarshes, and it was dark. \\n\\nThey walked slowly, stooping, keeping close in line, following \\nattentively every move that Gollum made. The fens grew more wet, opening \\ninto wide stagnant meres, among which it grew more and more difficult to \\nfind the firmer places where feet could tread without sinking into gurgling \\nmud. The travellers were light, or maybe none of them would ever have found \\na way through. \\n\\nPresently it grew altogether dark: the air itself seemed black and \\nheavy to breathe. When lights appeared Sam rubbed his eyes: he thought his \\nhead was going queer. He first saw one with the corner of his left eye, a \\nwisp of pale sheen that faded away; but others appeared soon after: some \\nlike dimly shining smoke, some like misty flames flickering slowly above \\nunseen candles; here and there they twisted like ghostly sheets unfurled by \\nhidden hands. But neither of his companions spoke a word. \\n\\nAt last Sam could bear it no longer. \\'What\\'s all this, Gollum? \\' he \\nsaid in a whisper. \\'These lights? They\\'re all round us now. Are we trapped? \\nWho are they? \\' \\n\\nGollum looked up. A dark water was before him, and he was crawling on \\nthe ground, this way and that, doubtful of the way. \\'Yes, they are all round \\nus,\\' he whispered. \\'The tricksy lights. Candles of corpses, yes, yes. Don\\'t \\nyou heed them! Don\\'t look! Don\\'t follow them! Where\\'s the master? \\' \\n\\nSam looked back and found that Frodo had lagged again. He could not see \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhim. He went some paces back into the darkness, not daring to move far, or \\nto call in more than a hoarse whisper. Suddenly he stumbled against Frodo, \\nwho was standing lost in thought, looking at the pale lights. His hands hung \\nstiff at his sides; water and slime were dripping from them. \\n\\n\\'Come, Mr. Frodo! \\' said Sam. \\'Don\\'t look at them! Gollum says we \\nmustn\\'t. Let\\'s keep up with him and get out of this cursed place as quick as \\nwe can -- if we can! \\' \\n\\n\\'All right,\\' said Frodo, as if returning out of a dream. \\'I\\'m coming. \\n\\nGo on! \\' \\n\\nHurrying forward again, Sam tripped, catching his foot in some old root \\nor tussock. He fell and came heavily on his hands, which sank deep into \\nsticky ooze, so that his face was brought close to the surface of the dark \\nmere. There was a faint hiss, a noisome smell went up, the lights flickered \\nand danced and swirled. For a moment the water below him looked like some \\nwindow, glazed with grimy glass, through which he was peering. Wrenching \\nhis \\n\\nhands out of the bog, he sprang back with a cry. \\'There are dead things, \\ndead faces in the water,\\' he said with horror. \\'Dead faces ! \\' \\n\\nGollum laughed. \\'The Dead Marshes, yes, yes: that is their names,\\' he \\ncackled. \\'You should not look in when the candles are lit.\\' \\n\\n\\'Who are they? What are they? \\' asked Sam shuddering, turning to Frodo, \\nwho was now behind him. \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know,\\' said Frodo in a dreamlike voice. \\'But I have seen them \\ntoo. In the pools when the candles were lit. They lie in all the pools, pale \\nfaces, deep deep under the dark water. I saw them: grim faces and evil, and \\nnoble faces and sad. Many faces proud and fair, and weeds in their silver \\nhair. But all foul, all rotting, all dead. A fell light is in them.\\' Frodo \\nhid his eyes in his hands. \\'I know not who they are; but I thought I saw \\nthere Men and Elves, and Ores beside them.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, yes,\\' said Gollum. \\'All dead, all rotten. Elves and Men and Ores. \\n\\nThe Dead Marshes. There was a great battle long ago, yes, so they told him \\nwhen Smjagol was young, when I was young before the Precious came. It was \\na \\n\\ngreat battle. Tall Men with long swords, and terrible Elves, and Orcses \\nshrieking. They fought on the plain for days and months at the Black Gates. \\nBut the Marshes have grown since then, swallowed up the graves; always \\ncreeping, creeping.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'But that is an age and more ago,\\' said Sam. The Dead can\\'t be really \\nthere! Is it some devilry hatched in the Dark Land? \\' \\n\\n\\'Who knows? Smjagol doesn\\'t know,\\' answered Gollum. \\'You cannot reach \\nthem, you cannot touch them. We tried once, .yes, precious. I tried once; \\nbut you cannot reach them. Only shapes to see, perhaps, not to touch. No \\nprecious! All dead.\\' \\n\\nSam looked darkly at him and shuddered again, thinking that he guessed \\nwhy Smjagol had tried to touch them. \\'Well, I don\\'t want to see them,\\' he \\nsaid. \\'Never again! Can\\'t we get on and get away? \\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, yes,\\' said Gollum. \\'But slowly, very slowly. Very carefully! Or \\nhobbits go down to join the Dead ones and light little candles. Follow \\nSmjagol! Don\\'t look at lights! \\' \\n\\nHe crawled away to the right, seeking for a path round the mere. They \\ncame close behind, stooping, often using their hands even as he did. \\'Three \\nprecious little Gollums in a row we shall be, if this goes on much longer,\\' \\nthought Sam. \\n\\nAt last they came to the end of the black mere, and they crossed it, \\nperilously, crawling or hopping from one treacherous island tussock to \\nanother. Often they floundered, stepping or falling hands-first into waters \\nas noisome as a cesspool, till they were slimed and fouled almost up to \\ntheir necks and stank in one another\\'s nostrils. \\n\\nIt was late in the night when at length they reached firmer ground \\nagain. Gollum hissed and whispered to himself, but it appeared that he was \\npleased: in some mysterious way, by some blended sense of feel, and smell, \\nand uncanny memory for shapes in the dark, he seemed to know just where he \\nwas again, and to be sure of his road ahead. \\n\\n\\'Now on we go! \\'he said. \\'Nice hobbits! Brave hobbits! Very very \\nweary, of course; so we are, my precious, all of us. But we must take master \\naway from the wicked lights, yes, yes, we must.\\' With these words he started \\noff again, almost at a trot, down what appeared to be a long lane between \\nhigh reeds, and they stumbled after him as quickly as they could. But in a \\nlittle while he stopped suddenly and sniffed the air doubtfully, hissing as \\nif he was troubled or displeased again. \\n\\n\\'What is it? \\' growled Sam, misinterpreting the signs. \\'What\\'s the need \\nto sniff? The stink nearly knocks me down with my nose held. You stink, and \\nmaster stinks; the whole place stinks.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, yes, and Sam stinks! \\' answered Gollum. \\'Poor Smjagol smells it, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbut good Smjagol bears it. Helps nice master. But that\\'s no matter. The \\nair\\'s moving, change is coming. Smjagol wonders; he\\'s not happy.\\' \\n\\nHe went on again, but his uneasiness grew, and every now and again he \\nstood up to his full height, craning his neck eastward and southward. For \\nsome time the hobbits could not hear or feel what was troubling him. Then \\nsuddenly all three halted, stiffening and listening. To Frodo and Sam it \\nseemed that they heard, far away, a long wailing cry, high and thin and \\ncruel. They shivered. At the same moment the stirring of the air became \\nperceptible to them; and it grew very cold. As they stood straining their \\nears, they heard a noise like a wind coming in the distance. The misty \\nlights wavered, dimmed, and went out. \\n\\nGollum would not move. He stood shaking and gibbering to himself, until \\nwith a rush the wind came upon them, hissing and snarling over the marshes. \\nThe night became less dark, light enough for them to see, or half see, \\nshapeless drifts of fog, curling and twisting as it rolled over them and \\npassed them. Looking up they saw the clouds breaking and shredding; and then \\nhigh in the south the moon glimmered out, riding in the flying wrack. \\n\\nFor a moment the sight of it gladdened the hearts of the hobbits; but \\nGollum cowered down, muttering curses on the White Face. Then Frodo and \\nSam \\n\\nstaring at the sky, breathing deeply of the fresher air, saw it come: a \\nsmall cloud flying from the accursed hills; a black shadow loosed from \\nMordor; a vast shape winged and ominous. It scudded across the moon, and \\nwith a deadly cry went away westward, outrunning the wind in its fell speed. \\n\\nThey fell forward, grovelling heedlessly on the cold earth. But the \\nshadow of horror wheeled and returned, passing lower now, right above them, \\nsweeping the fen-reek with its ghastly wings. And then it was gone, flying \\nback to Mordor with the speed of the wrath of Sauron; and behind it the wind \\nroared away, leaving the Dead Marshes bare and bleak. The naked waste, as \\nfar as the eye could pierce, even to the distant menace of the mountains, \\nwas dappled with the fitful moonlight. \\n\\nFrodo and Sam got up, rubbing their eyes, like children wakened from an \\nevil dream to find the familiar night still over the world. But Gollum lay \\non the ground as if he had been stunned. They roused him with difficulty, \\nand for some time he would not lift his face, but knelt forward on his \\nelbows, covering the back of his head with his large flat hands. \\n\\n\\'Wraiths!\\' he wailed. \\'Wraiths on wings! The Precious is their master. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThey see everything, everything. Nothing can hide from them. Curse the White \\nFace! And they tell Him everything. He sees, He knows. Ach, gollum, gollum, \\ngolluml \\' It was not until the moon had sunk, westering far beyond Tol \\nBrandir, that he would get up or make a move. \\n\\nFrom that time on Sam thought that he sensed a change in Gollum again. \\n\\nHe was more fawning and would-be friendly; but Sam surprised some strange \\nlooks in his eyes at times, especially towards Frodo; and he went back more \\nand more into his old manner of speaking. And Sam had another growing \\nanxiety. Frodo seemed to be weary, weary to the point of exhaustion. He said \\nnothing, indeed he hardly spoke at all; and he did not complain, but he \\nwalked like one who carries a load, the weight of which is ever increasing; \\nand he dragged along, slower and slower, so that Sam had often to beg Gollum \\nto wait and not to leave their master behind. \\n\\nIn fact with every step towards the gates of Mordor Frodo felt the Ring \\non its chain about his neck grow more burdensome. He was now beginning to \\nfeel it as an actual weight dragging him earthwards. But far more he was \\ntroubled by the Eye: so he called it to himself. It was that more than the \\ndrag of the Ring that made him cower and stoop as he walked. The Eye: that \\nhorrible growing sense of a hostile will that strove with great power to \\npierce all shadows of cloud, and earth, and flesh, and to see you: to pin \\nyou under its deadly gaze, naked, immovable. So thin, so frail and thin, the \\nveils were become that still warded it off. Frodo knew just where the \\npresent habitation and heart of that will now was: as certainly as a man can \\ntell the direction of the sun with his eyes shut. He was facing it, and its \\npotency beat upon his brow. \\n\\nGollum probably felt something of the same sort. But what went on in \\nhis wretched heart between the pressure of the Eye, and the lust of the Ring \\nthat was so near, and his grovelling promise made half in the fear of cold \\niron, the hobbits did not guess: Frodo gave no thought to it. Sam\\'s mind was \\noccupied mostly with his master hardly noticing the dark cloud that had \\nfallen on his own heart. He put Frodo in front of him now, and kept a \\nwatchful eye on every movement of his, supporting him if he stumbled, and \\ntrying to encourage him with clumsy words. \\n\\nWhen day came at last the hobbits were surprised to see how much closer \\nthe ominous mountains had already drawn. The air was now clearer and colder, \\nand though still far off, the walls of Mordor were no longer a cloudy menace \\non the edge of sight, but as grim black towers they frowned across a dismal \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwaste. The marshes were at an end, dying away into dead peats and wide flats \\nof dry cracked mud. The land ahead rose in long shallow slopes, barren and \\npitiless, towards the desert that lay at Sauron\\'s gate. \\n\\nWhile the grey light lasted, they cowered under a black stone like \\nworms, shrinking, lest the winged terror should pass and spy them with its \\ncruel eyes. The remainder of that journey was a shadow of growing fear in \\nwhich memory could find nothing to rest upon. For two more nights they \\nstruggled on through the weary pathless land. The air, as it seemed to them, \\ngrew harsh, and filled with a bitter reek that caught their breath and \\nparched their mouths. \\n\\nAt last, on the fifth morning since they took the road with Gollum, \\nthey halted once more. Before them dark in the dawn the great mountains \\nreached up to roofs of smoke and cloud. Out from their feet were flung huge \\nbuttresses and broken hills that were now at the nearest scarce a dozen \\nmiles away. Frodo looked round in horror. Dreadful as the Dead Marshes had \\nbeen, and the arid moors of the Noman-lands, more loathsome far was the \\ncountry that the crawling day now slowly unveiled to his shrinking eyes. \\nEven to the Mere of Dead Faces some haggard phantom of green spring \\nwould \\n\\ncome; but here neither spring nor summer would ever come again. Here \\nnothing \\n\\nlived, not even the leprous growths that feed on rottenness. The gasping \\npools were choked with ash and crawling muds, sickly white and grey, as if \\nthe mountains had vomited the filth of their entrails upon the lands about. \\n\\nHigh mounds of crushed and powdered rock, great cones of earth fire-blasted \\nand poison-stained, stood like an obscene graveyard in endless rows, slowly \\nrevealed in the reluctant light. \\n\\nThey had come to the desolation that lay before Mordor: the lasting \\nmonument to the dark labour of its slaves that should endure when all their \\npurposes were made void; a land defiled, diseased beyond all healing -- \\nunless the Great Sea should enter in and wash it with oblivion. V I feel \\nsick,\\' said Sam. Frodo did not speak. \\n\\nFor a while they stood there, like men on the edge of a sleep where \\nnightmare lurks, holding it off, though they know that they can only come to \\nmorning through the shadows. The light broadened and hardened. The \\ngasping \\n\\npits and poisonous mounds grew hideously clear. The sun was up, walking \\n\\n\\n\\n\\namong clouds and long flags of smoke, but even the sunlight was defiled. The \\nhobbits had no welcome for that light; unfriendly it seemed, revealing them \\nin their helplessness -- little squeaking ghosts that wandered among the \\nash-heaps of the Dark Lord. \\n\\nToo weary to go further they sought for some place where they could \\nrest. For a while they sat without speaking under the shadow of a mound of \\nslag; but foul fumes leaked out of it, catching their throats and choking \\nthem. Gollum was the first to get up. Spluttering and cursing he rose, and \\nwithout a word or a glance at the hobbits he crawled away on all fours. \\nFrodo and Sam crawled after him, until they came to a wide almost circular \\npit, high-banked upon the west. It was cold and dead, and a foul sump of \\noily many-coloured ooze lay at its bottom. In this evil hole they cowered, \\nhoping in its shadow to escape the attention of the Eye. \\n\\nThe day passed slowly. A great thirst troubled them, but they drank \\nonly a few drops from their bottles-last filled in the gully, which now as \\nthey looked back in thought seemed to them a place of peace and beauty. The \\nhobbits took it in turn to watch. At first, tired as they were, neither of \\nthem could sleep at all; but as the sun far away was climbing down into slow \\nmoving cloud, Sam dozed. It was Frodo\\'s turn to be on guard. He lay back on \\nthe slope of the pit, but that did not ease the sense of burden that was on \\nhim. He looked up at the smoke-streaked sky and saw strange phantoms, dark \\nriding shapes, and faces out of the past. He lost count of time, hovering \\nbetween sleep and waking, until forgetfulness came over him. \\n\\nSuddenly Sam woke up thinking that he heard his master calling. It was \\nevening. Frodo could not have called, for he had fallen asleep, and had slid \\ndown nearly to the bottom of the pit. Gollum was by him. For a moment Sam \\nthought that he was trying to rouse Frodo; then he saw that it was not so. \\nGollum was talking to himself. Smjagol was holding a debate with some other \\nthought that used the same voice but made it squeak and hiss. A pale light \\nand a green light alternated in his eyes as he spoke. \\n\\n\\'Smjagol promised,\\' said the first thought. \\n\\n\\'Yes, yes, my precious,\\' came the answer, \\'we promised: to save our \\nPrecious, not to let Him have it -- never. But it\\'s going to Him yes, nearer \\nevery step. What\\'s the hobbit going to do with it, we wonders, yes we \\nwonders.\\' \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know. I can\\'t help it. Master\\'s got it. Smjagol promised to \\nhelp the master.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Yes, yes, to help the master: the master of the Precious. But if we \\nwas master, then we could help ourself s, yes, and still keep promises.\\' \\n\\n\\'But Smjagol said he would be very very good. Nice hobbit! He took \\ncruel rope off Smjagol\\'s leg. He speaks nicely to me.\\' \\n\\n\\'Very very good, eh, my precious? Let\\'s be good, good as fish, sweet \\none, but to ourselfs. Not hurt the nice hobbit, of course, no, no.\\' \\n\\n\\'But the Precious holds the promise,\\' the voice of Smjagol objected. \\n\\n\\'Then take it,\\' said the other, \\'and let\\'s hold it ourselfs! Then we \\nshall be master, golluml Make the other hobbit, the nasty suspicious hobbit, \\nmake him crawl, yes, golluml\\' \\n\\n\\'But not the nice hobbit? \\' \\n\\n\\'Oh no, not if it doesn\\'t please us. Still he\\'s a Baggins, my precious, \\nyes, a Baggins. A Baggins stole it. He found it and he said nothing, \\nnothing. We hates Bagginses.\\' \\n\\n\\'No, not this Baggins.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, every Baggins. All peoples that keep the Precious. We must have \\nit! \\' \\n\\n\\'But He\\'ll see, He\\'ll know. He\\'ll take it from us! \\' \\n\\n\\'He sees. He knows. He heard us make silly promises -- against His \\norders, yes. Must take it. The Wraiths are searching. Must take it.\\' \\n\\n\\'Not for Him! \\' \\n\\n\\'No, sweet one. See, my precious: if we has it, then we can escape, \\neven from Him, eh? Perhaps we grows very strong, stronger than Wraiths. Lord \\nSmjagol? Gollum the Great? The Gollum! Eat fish every day, three times a \\nday; fresh from the sea. Most Precious Gollum! Must have it. We wants it, we \\nwants it, we wants it! \\' \\n\\n\\'But there\\'s two of them. They\\'ll wake too quick and kill us,\\' whined \\nSmjagol in a last effort. \\'Not now. Not yet.\\' \\n\\n\\'We wants it! But\\' -- and here there was a long pause, as if a new \\nthought had wakened. \\'Not yet, eh? Perhaps not. She might help. She might, \\nyes.\\' \\n\\n\\'No, no! Not that way! \\' wailed Smjagol. \\n\\n\\'Yes! We wants it! We wants it! \\' \\n\\nEach time that the second thought spoke, Gollum\\'s long hand crept out \\nslowly, pawing towards Frodo, and then was drawn back with a jerk as \\nSmjagol \\n\\nspoke again. Finally both arms, with long fingers flexed and twitching, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nclawed towards his neck. \\n\\nSam had lain still, fascinated by this debate, but watching every move \\nthat Gollum made from under his half-closed eye-lids. To his simple mind \\nordinary hunger, the desire to eat hobbits, had seemed the chief danger in \\nGollum. He realized now that it was not so: Gollum was feeling the terrible \\ncall of the Ring. The Dark Lord was He, of course; but Sam wondered who \\nShe \\n\\nwas. One of the nasty friends the little wretch had made in his wanderings, \\nhe supposed. Then he forgot the point, for things had plainly gone far \\nenough, and were getting dangerous. A great heaviness was in all his limbs, \\nbut he roused himself with an effort and sat up. Something warned him to be \\ncareful and not to reveal that he had overheard the debate. He let out a \\nloud sigh and gave a huge yawn. \\n\\n\\'What\\'s the time? \\' he said sleepily. \\n\\nGollum sent out a long hiss through his teeth. He stood up for a \\nmoment, tense and menacing; and then he collapsed, falling forward on to all \\nfours and crawling up the bank of the pit. \\'Nice hobbits! Nice Sam! \\' he \\nsaid. \\'Sleepy heads, yes, sleepy heads! Leave good Smjagol to watch! But \\nit\\'s evening. Dusk is creeping. Time to go.\\' \\n\\n\\'High time! \\' thought Sam. \\'And time we parted, too.\\' Yet it crossed \\nhis mind to wonder if indeed Gollum was not now as dangerous turned loose as \\nkept with them. \\'Curse him! I wish he was choked!\\' he muttered. He stumbled \\ndown the bank and roused his master. \\n\\nStrangely enough, Frodo felt refreshed. He had been dreaming. The dark \\nshadow had passed, and a fair vision had visited him in this land of \\ndisease. Nothing remained of it in his memory, yet because of it he felt \\nglad and lighter of heart. His burden was less heavy on him. Gollum welcomed \\nhim with dog-like delight. He chuckled and chattered, cracking his long \\nfingers, and pawing at Frodo\\'s knees. Frodo smiled at him. \\n\\n\\'Come! \\' he said. \\'You have guided us well and faithfully. This is the \\nlast stage. Bring us to the Gate, and then I will not ask you to go further. \\n\\nBring us to the Gate, and you may go where you wish -- only not to our \\nenemies.\\' \\n\\n\\'To the Gate, eh?\\' Gollum squeaked, seeming surprised and frightened. \\n\\n\\'To the Gate, master says! Yes, he says so. And good Smjagol does what he \\nasks, O yes. But when we gets closer, we\\'ll see perhaps we\\'ll see then. It \\nwon\\'t look nice at all. O no! O no!\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Go on with you! \\' said Sam. \\'Let\\'s get it over! \\' \\n\\nIn the falling dusk they scrambled out of the pit and slowly threaded \\ntheir way through the dead land. They had not gone far before they felt once \\nmore the fear that had fallen on them when the winged shape swept over the \\nmarshes. They halted, cowering on the evil-smelling ground; but they saw \\nnothing in the gloomy evening sky above, and soon the menace passed, high \\noverhead, going maybe on some swift errand from Barad-dyr. After a while \\nGollum got up and crept forward again, muttering and shaking. \\n\\nAbout an hour after midnight the fear fell on them a third time, but it \\nnow seemed more remote, as if it were passing far above the clouds, rushing \\nwith terrible speed into the West. Gollum, however, was helpless with \\nterror, and was convinced that they were being hunted, that their approach \\nwas known. \\n\\n\\'Three times! \\' he whimpered. \\'Three times is a threat. They feel us \\nhere, they feel the Precious. The Precious is their master. We cannot go any \\nfurther this way, no. It\\'s no use, no use! \\' \\n\\nPleading and kind words were no longer of any avail. It was not until \\nFrodo commanded him angrily and laid a hand on his sword-hilt that Gollum \\nwould get up again. Then at last he rose with a snarl, and went before them \\nlike a beaten dog. \\n\\nSo they stumbled on through the weary end of the night, and until the \\ncoming of another day of fear they walked in silence with bowed heads, \\nseeing nothing, and hearing nothing but the wind hissing in their ears. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 3 . The Black Gate is Closed \\n\\n\\n\\nBefore the next day dawned their journey to Mordor was over. The \\nmarshes and the desert were behind them. Before them, darkling against a \\npallid sky, the great mountains reared their threatening heads. \\n\\nUpon the west of Mordor marched the gloomy range of Ephel D(r)ath, the \\nMountains of Shadow, and upon the north the broken peaks and barren ridges \\nof Ered Lithui, grey as ash. But as these ranges approached one another, \\nbeing indeed but parts of one great wall about the mournful plains of \\nLithlad and of Gorgoroth, and the bitter inland sea of N(r) men amidmost, they \\nswung out long arms northward; and between these arms there was a deep \\ndefile. This was Cirith Gorgor, the Haunted Pass, the entrance to the land \\nof the Enemy. High cliffs lowered upon either side, and thrust forward from \\nits mouth were two sheer hills, black -boned and bare. Upon them stood the \\nTeeth of Mordor, two towers strong and tall. In days long past they were \\nbuilt by the Men of Gondor in their pride and power, after the overthrow of \\nSauron and his flight, lest he should seek to return to his old realm. But \\nthe strength of Gondor failed, and men slept, and for long years the towers \\nstood empty. Then Sauron returned. Now the watch-towers, which had fallen \\ninto decay, were repaired, and filled with arms, and garrisoned with \\nceaseless vigilance. Stony -faced they were, with dark window-holes staring \\nnorth and east and west, and each window was full of sleepless eyes. \\n\\nAcross the mouth of the pass, from cliff to cliff, the Dark Lord had \\nbuilt a rampart of stone. In it there was a single gate of iron, and upon \\nits battlement sentinels paced unceasingly. Beneath the hills on either side \\nthe rock was bored into a hundred caves and maggot-holes: there a host of \\nores lurked, ready at a signal to issue forth like black ants going to war. \\n\\nNone could pass the Teeth of Mordor and not feel their bite, unless they \\nwere summoned by Sauron, or knew the secret passwords that would open \\nthe \\n\\nMorannon, the black gate of his land. \\n\\nThe two hobbits gazed at the towers and the wall in despair. Even from \\na distance they could see in the dim light the movement of the black guards \\nupon the wall, and the patrols before the gate. They lay now peering over \\nthe edge of a rocky hollow beneath the out-stretched shadow of the northmost \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbuttress of Ephel D(r)ath. Winging the heavy air in a straight flight a crow, \\nmaybe, would have flown but a furlong from their hiding-place to the black \\nsummit of the nearer tower. A faint smoke curled above it, as if fire \\nsmouldered in the hill beneath. \\n\\nDay came, and the fallow sun blinked over the lifeless ridges of Ered \\nLithui. Then suddenly the cry of brazen-throated trumpets was heard: from \\nthe watch-towers they blared, and far away from hidden holds and outposts in \\nthe hills came answering calls; and further still, remote but deep and \\nominous, there echoed in the hollow land beyond the mighty horns and drums \\nof Barad-dyr. Another dreadful day of fear and toil had come to Mordor; and \\nthe night-guards were summoned to their dungeons and deep halls, and the \\nday-guards, evil-eyed and fell, were marching to their posts. Steel gleamed \\ndimly on the battlement. \\n\\n\\'Well, here we are! \\' said Sam. \\'Here\\'s the Gate, and it looks to me as \\nif that\\'s about as far as we are ever going to get. My word, but the Gaffer \\nwould have a thing or two to say, if he saw me now! Often said I\\'d come to a \\nbad end, if I didn\\'t watch my step, he did. But now I don\\'t suppose I\\'ll \\never see the old fellow again. He\\'ll miss his chance of I told\\'ee so, Sam: \\nmore\\'s the pity. He could go on telling me as long as he\\'d got breath, if \\nonly I could see his old face again. But I\\'d have to get a wash first, or he \\nwouldn\\'t know me. \\n\\n\\'I suppose it\\'s no good asking \"what way do we go now?\" We can\\'t go no \\nfurther -unless we want to ask the ores for a lift.\\' \\n\\n\\'No, no! \\' said Gollum. \\'No use. We can\\'t go further. Smjagol said so. \\n\\nHe said: we\\'ll go to the Gate, and then we\\'ll see. And we do see. O yes. my \\nprecious, we do see. Smjagol knew hobbits could not go this way. O yes. \\nSmjagol knew \\' \\n\\n\\'Then what the plague did you bring us here for? \\' said Sam, not \\nfeeling in the mood to be just or reasonable. \\n\\n\\'Master said so. Master says: Bring us to the Gate. So good Smjagol \\ndoes so. Master said so, wise master.\\' \\n\\n\\'I did,\\' said Frodo. His face was grim and set. but resolute. He was \\nfilthy, haggard, and pinched with weariness, but he cowered no longer, and \\nhis eyes were clear. \\'I said so, because I purpose to enter Mordor, and I \\nknow no other way. Therefore I shall go this way. I do not ask anyone to go \\nwith me.\\' \\n\\n\\'No, no, master! \\' wailed Gollum; pawing at him, and seeming in great \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndistress. \\'No use that way! No use! Don\\'t take the Precious to Him! He\\'ll \\neat us all, if He gets it, eat all the world. Keep it, nice master, and be \\nkind to Smjagol. Don\\'t let Him have it. Or go away, go to nice places, and \\ngive it back to little Smjagol. Yes, yes, master: give it back, eh? Smjagol \\nwill keep it safe; he will do lots of good, especially to nice hobbits. \\n\\nHobbits go home. Don\\'t go to the Gate! \\' \\n\\n\\'I am commanded to go to the land of Mordor, and therefore I shall go,\\' \\nsaid Frodo. \\'If there is only one way, then I must take it. What comes after \\nmust come.\\' \\n\\nSam said nothing. The look on Frodo\\'s face was enough for him he knew \\nthat words of his were useless. And after all he never had any real hope in \\nthe affair from the beginning; but being a cheerful hobbit he had not needed \\nhope, as long as despair could be postponed. Now they were come to the \\nbitter end. But he had stuck to his master all the way; that was what he had \\nchiefly come for, and he would still stick to him. His master would not go \\nto Mordor alone. Sam would go with him-and at any rate they would get rid of \\nGollum. \\n\\nGollum, however, did not intend to be got rid of, yet. He knelt at \\nFrodo\\'s feet, wringing his hands and squeaking. \\'Not this way, master! \\' he \\npleaded, \\'There is another way. O yes indeed there is. Another way. darker, \\nmore difficult to find, more secret. But Smjagol knows it. Let Smjagol show \\nyou! \\' \\n\\n\\'Another way! \\' said Frodo doubtfully, looking down at Gollum with \\nsearching eyes. \\n\\n\\'Yess! Yess indeed! There was another way. Smjagol found it. Let\\'s go \\nand see if it\\'s still there! \\' \\n\\n\\'You have not spoken of this before.\\' \\n\\n\\'No. Master did not ask. Master did not say what he meant to do. He \\ndoes not tell poor Smjagol. He says: Smjagol, take me to the Gate -- and \\nthen good bye! Smjagol can run away and be good. But now he says: I purpose \\nto enter Mordor this way. So Smjagol is very afraid. He does not want to \\nlose nice master. And he promised, master made him promise, to save the \\nPrecious. But master is going to take it to Him, straight to the Black Hand, \\nif master will go this way. So Smjagol must save them both, and he thinks of \\nanother way that there was, once upon a time. Nice master. Smjagol very \\ngood, always helps.\\' \\n\\nSam frowned. If he could have bored holes in Gollum with his eyes, he \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwould have done. His mind was full of doubt. To all appearances Gollum was \\ngenuinely distressed and anxious to help Frodo. But Sam, remembering the \\noverheard debate, found it hard to believe that the long submerged Smjagol \\nhad come out on top: that voice at any rate had not had the last word in the \\ndebate. Sam\\'s guess was that the Smjagol and Gollum halves (or what in his \\nown mind he called Slinker and Stinker) had made a truce and a temporary \\nalliance: neither wanted the Enemy to get the Ring; both wished to keep \\nFrodo from capture, and under their eye, as long as possible -- at any rate \\nas long as Stinker still had a chance of laying hands on his \\'Precious\\'. \\nWhether there really was another way into Mordor Sam doubted. \\n\\n\\'And it\\'s a good thing neither half of the old villain don\\'t know what \\nmaster means to do,\\' he thought. \\'If he knew that Mr. Frodo is trying to put \\nan end to his Precious for good and all, there\\'d be trouble pretty quick, I \\nbet. Anyhow old Stinker is so frightened of the Enemy -- and he\\'s under \\norders of some kind from him, or was -- that he\\'d give us away rather than \\nbe caught helping us; and rather than let his Precious be melted, maybe. At \\nleast that\\'s my idea. And I hope the master will think it out carefully. \\n\\nHe\\'s as wise as any, but he\\'s soft-hearted, that\\'s what he is. It\\'s beyond \\nany Gamgee to guess what he\\'ll do next.\\' \\n\\nFrodo did not answer Gollum at once. While these doubts were passing \\nthrough Sam\\'s slow but shrewd mind, he stood gazing out towards the dark \\ncliff of Cirith Gorgor. The hollow in which they had taken refuge was delved \\nin the side of a low hill, at some little height above a long trenchlike \\nvalley that lay between it and the outer buttresses of the mountains. In the \\nmidst of the valley stood the black foundations of the western watch-tower. \\n\\nBy morning -light the roads that converged upon the Gate of Mordor could \\nnow \\n\\nbe clearly seen, pale and dusty; one winding back northwards; another \\ndwindling eastwards into the mists that clung about the feet of Ered Lithui; \\nand a third that ran towards him. As it bent sharply round the tower, it \\nentered a narrow defile and passed not far below the hollow where he stood. \\nWestward, to his right, it turned, skirting the shoulders of the mountains, \\nand went off southwards into the deep shadows that mantled all the western \\nsides of Ephel D(r)ath; beyond his sight it journeyed on into the narrow land \\nbetween the mountains and the Great River. \\n\\nAs he gazed Frodo became aware that there was a great stir and movement \\non the plain. It seemed as if whole armies were on the march, though for the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmost part they were hidden by the reeks and fumes drifting from the fens and \\nwastes beyond. But here and there he caught the gleam of spears and helmets; \\nand over the levels beside the roads horsemen could be seen riding in many \\ncompanies. He remembered his vision from afar upon Amon Hen, so few \\ndays \\n\\nbefore, though now it seemed many years ago. Then he knew that the hope that \\nhad for one wild moment stirred in his heart was vain. The trumpets had not \\nrung in challenge but in greeting. This was no assault upon the Dark Lord by \\nthe men of Gondor, risen like avenging ghosts from the graves of valour long \\npassed away. These were Men of other race, out of the wide Eastlands, \\ngathering to the summons of their Overlord; armies that had encamped before \\nhis Gate by night and now marched in to swell his mounting power. As if \\nsuddenly made fully aware of the peril of their position, alone, in the \\ngrowing light of day, so near to this vast menace, Frodo quickly drew his \\nfrail grey hood close upon his head, and stepped down into the dell. Then he \\nturned to Gollum. \\n\\n\\'Smjagol,\\' he said, \\'I will trust you once more. Indeed it seems that I \\nmust do so, and that it is my fate to receive help from you. where I least \\nlooked for it, and your fate to help me whom you long pursued with evil \\npurpose. So far you have deserved well of me and have kept your promise \\ntruly. Truly, I say and mean,\\' he added with a glance at Sam, \\'for twice now \\nwe have been in your power, and you have done no harm to us. Nor have you \\ntried to take from me what you once sought. May the third time prove the \\nbest! But I warn you, Smjagol, you are in danger.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, yes, master! \\' said Gollum. \\'Dreadful danger! Smjagol\\'s bones \\nshake to think of it. but he doesn\\'t run away. He must help nice master.\\' \\n\\n\\'I did not mean the danger that we all share,\\' said Frodo. \\'I mean a \\ndanger to yourself alone. You swore a promise by what you call the Precious. \\nRemember that! It will hold you to it; but it will seek a way to twist it to \\nyour own undoing. Already you are being twisted. You revealed yourself to me \\njust now, foolishly. Give it back to Smjagol you said. Do not say that \\nagain! Do not let that thought grow in you! You will never get it back. But \\nthe desire of it may betray you to a bitter end. You will never get it back. \\n\\nIn the last need, Smjagol, I should put on the Precious; and the Precious \\nmastered you long ago. If I, wearing it, were to command you, you would \\nobey, even if it were to leap from a precipice or to cast yourself into the \\nfire. And such would be my command. So have a care, Smjagol!\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSam looked at his master with approval, but also with surprise: there \\nwas a look in his face and a tone in his voice that he had not known before. \\n\\nIt had always been a notion of his that the kindness of dear Mr. Frodo was \\nof such a high degree that it must imply a fair measure of blindness. Of \\ncourse, he also firmly held the incompatible belief that Mr. Frodo was the \\nwisest person in the world (with the possible exception of Old Mr. Bilbo and \\nof Gandalf). Gollum in his own way, and with much more excuse as his \\nacquaintance was much briefer, may have _made a similar mistake, confusing \\nkindness and blindness. At any rate this speech abashed and terrified him. \\n\\nHe grovelled on the ground and could speak no clear words but nice master. \\n\\nFrodo waited patiently for a while, then he spoke again less sternly. \\n\\n\\'Come now, Gollum or Smjagol if you wish, tell me of this other way, and \\nshow me, if you can, what hope there is in it, enough to justify me in \\nturning aside from my plain path. I am in haste.\\' \\n\\nBut Gollum was in a pitiable state, and Frodo\\'s threat had quite \\nunnerved him. It was not easy to get any clear account out of him, amid his \\nmumblings and squeakings, and the frequent interruptions in which he crawled \\non the floor and begged them both to be kind to \\'poor little Smjagol\\'. After \\na while he grew a little calmer, and Frodo gathered bit by bit that, if a \\ntraveller followed the road that turned west of Ephel D(r)ath, he would come \\nin time to a crossing in a circle of dark trees. On the right a road went \\ndown to Osgiliath and the bridges of the Anduin; in the middle the road went \\non southwards. \\n\\n\\'On, on, on,\\' said Gollum. \\'We never went that way, but they say it \\ngoes a hundred leagues, until you can see the Great Water that is never \\nstill. There are lots of fishes there, and big birds eat fishes: nice birds: \\nbut we never went there, alas no! we never had a chance. And further still \\nthere are more lands, they say, but the Yellow Face is very hot there, and \\nthere are seldom any clouds, and the men are fierce and have dark faces. We \\ndo not want to see that land.\\' \\n\\n\\'No! \\' said Frodo. \\'But do not wander from your road. What of the third \\nturning? \\' \\n\\n\\'O yes, O yes, there is a third way,\\' said Gollum. \\'That is the road to \\nthe left. At once it begins to climb up, up, winding and climbing back \\ntowards the tall shadows. When it turns round the black rock, you\\'ll see it. \\nsuddenly you\\'ll see it above you, and you\\'ll want to hide.\\' \\n\\n\\'See it, see it? What will you see? \\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'The old fortress, very old, very horrible now. We used to hear tales \\nfrom the South, when Smjagol was young, long ago. O yes. we used to tell \\nlots of tales in the evening, sitting by the banks of the Great River, in \\nthe willow-lands, when the River was younger too, gollum, gollum.\\' He began \\nto weep and mutter. The hobbits waited patiently. \\n\\n\\'Tales out of the South,\\' Gollum went on again, \\'about the tall Men \\nwith the shining eyes, and their houses like hills of stone, and the silver \\ncrown of their King and his White Tree: wonderful tales. They built very \\ntall towers, and one they raised was silver-white, and in it there was a \\nstone like the Moon, and round it were great white walls. O yes, there were \\nmany tales about the Tower of the Moon.\\' \\n\\n\\'That would be Minas Ithil that Isildur the son of Elendil built \\' said \\nFrodo. \\'It was Isildur who cut off the finger of the Enemy.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, He has only four on the Black Hand, but they are enough,\\' said \\nGollum shuddering. \\'And He hated Isildur\\' s city.\\' \\n\\n\\'What does he not hate? \\' said Frodo. \\'But what has the Tower of the \\nMoon to do with us? \\' \\n\\n\\'Well, master, there it was and there it is: the tall tower and the \\nwhite houses and the wall; but not nice now, not beautiful. He conquered it \\nlong ago. It is a very terrible place now. Travellers shiver when they see \\nit, they creep out of sight, they avoid its shadow. But master will have to \\ngo that way. That is the only other way, For the mountains are lower there, \\nand the old road goes up and up, until it reaches a dark pass at the top, \\nand then it goes down, down, again -- to Gorgoroth.\\' His voice sank to a \\nwhisper and he shuddered. \\n\\n\\'But how will that help us? \\' asked Sam. \\'Surely the Enemy knows all \\nabout his own mountains, and that road will be guarded as close as this? The \\ntower isn\\'t empty, is it? \\' \\n\\n\\'O no, not empty! \\' whispered Gollum. \\'It seems empty, but it isn\\'t, O \\nno! Very dreadful things live there. Ores, yes always Ores; but worse \\nthings, worse things live there too. The road climbs right under the shadow \\nof the walls and passes the gate. Nothing moves on the road that they don\\'t \\nknow about. The things inside know: the Silent Watchers.\\' \\n\\n\\'So that\\'s your advice is it,\\' said Sam, \\'that we should go another \\nlong march south, to find ourselves in the same fix or a worse one, when we \\nget there, if we ever do? \\' \\n\\n\\'No, no indeed,\\' said Gollum. \\'Hobbits must see, must try to \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nunderstand. He does not expect attack that way. His Eye is all round, but it \\nattends more to some places than to others. He can\\'t see everything all at \\nonce, not yet. You see, He has conquered all the country west of the Shadowy \\nMountains down to the River, and He holds the bridges now. He thinks no one \\ncan come to the Moontower without fighting big battle at the bridges, or \\ngetting lots of boats which they cannot hide and He will know about.\\' \\n\\n\\'You seem to know a lot about what He\\'s doing and thinking,\\' said Sam. \\n\\'Have you been talking to Him lately? Or just hobnobbing with Ores? \\' \\n\\n\\'Not nice hobbit, not sensible,\\' said Gollum, giving Sam an angry \\nglance and turning to Frodo. \\'Smjagol has talked to Ores, yes of course, \\nbefore he met master, and to many peoples: he has walked very far. And what \\nhe says now many peoples are saying. It\\'s here in the North that the big \\ndanger is for Him, and for us. He will come out of the Black Gate one day, \\none day soon. That is the only way big armies can come. But away down west \\nHe is not afraid, and there are the Silent Watchers.\\' \\n\\n\\'Just so! \\' said Sam, not to be put off. \\'And so we are to walk up and \\nknock at their gate and ask if we\\'re on the right road for Mordor? Or are \\nthey too silent to answer? It\\'s not. sense. We might as well do it here, and \\nsave ourselves a long tramp.\\' \\n\\n\\'Don\\'t make jokes about it,\\' hissed Gollum. \\'It isn\\'t funny, O no! Not \\namusing. It\\'s nut sense to try and get into Mordor at all. But if master \\nsays I must go or I will go, then he must try some way. But he must not go \\nto the terrible city, O no, of course not. That is where Smjagol helps, nice \\nSmjagol. though no one tells him what it is all about. Smjagol helps again. \\n\\nHe found it. He knows it.\\' \\n\\n\\'What did you find? \\' asked Frodo. \\n\\nGollum crouched down and his voice sank to a whisper again. \\'A little \\npath leading up into the mountains: and then a stair, a narrow stair, O yes, \\nvery long and narrow. And then more stairs. And then\\' -- his voice sank even \\nlower -- \\'a tunnel, a dark tunnel; and at last a little cleft, and a path \\nhigh above the main pass. It was that way that Smjagol got out of the \\ndarkness. But it was years ago. The path may have vanished now; but perhaps \\nnot, perhaps not.\\' \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t like the sound of it at all,\\' said Sam. \\'Sounds too easy at \\nany rate in the telling. If that path is still there, it\\'ll be guarded too. \\n\\nWasn\\'t it guarded, Gollum? \\' As he said this, he caught or fancied he caught \\na green gleam in Gollum\\' s eye. Gollum muttered but did not reply. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Is it not guarded? \\' asked Frodo sternly. \\'And did you escape out of \\nthe darkness, Smjagol? Were you not rather permitted to depart upon an \\nerrand? That at least is w hat Aragorn thought, who found you by the Dead \\nMarshes some years ago.\\' \\n\\n\\'It\\'s a lie! \\' hissed Gollum, and an evil light came into his eyes at \\nthe naming of Aragorn. \\'He lied on me, yes he did. I did escape, all by my \\npoor self. Indeed I was told to seek for the Precious; and I have searched \\nand searched, of course I have. But not for the Black One. The Precious was \\nours, it was mine I tell you. I did escape.\\' \\n\\nFrodo felt a strange certainty that in this matter Gollum was for once \\nnot so far from the truth as might be suspected; that he had somehow found a \\nway out of Mordor, and at least believed that it was by his own cunning. For \\none thing, he noted that Gollum used I, and that seemed usually to be a \\nsign, on its rare appearances, that some remnants of old truth and sincerity \\nwere for the moment on top. But even if Gollum could be trusted on this \\npoint, Frodo did not forget the wiles of the Enemy. The \\'escape\\' may have \\nbeen allowed or arranged, and well known in the Dark Tower. And in any case \\nGollum was plainly keeping a good deal back. \\n\\n\\'I ask you again,\\' he said: \\'is not this secret way guarded? \\' \\n\\nBut the name of Aragorn had put Gollum into a sullen mood. He had all \\nthe injured air of a liar suspected when for once he has told the truth, or \\npart of it. He did not answer. \\n\\n\\'Is it not guarded? \\' Frodo repeated. \\n\\n\\'Yes, yes, perhaps. No safe places in this country,\\' said Gollum \\nsulkily. \\'No safe places. But master must try it or go home. . No other \\nway.\\' They could not get him to say more. The name of the perilous place and \\nthe high pass he could not tell, or would not. \\n\\nIts name was Cirith Ungol, a name of dreadful rumour. Aragorn could \\nperhaps have told them that name and its significance: Gandalf would have \\nwarned them. But they were alone, and Aragorn was far away, and Gandalf \\nstood amid the ruin of Isengard and strove with Saruman, delayed by treason. \\nYet even as he spoke his last words to Saruman, and the palantnr crashed in \\nfire upon the steps of Orthanc. his thought was ever upon Frodo and Samwise, \\nover the long leagues his mind sought for them in hope and pity. \\n\\nMaybe Frodo felt it, not knowing it, as he had upon Amon Hen, even \\nthough he believed that Gandalf was gone, gone for ever into the shadow in \\nMoria far away. He sat upon the ground for a long while, silent, his head \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbowed, striving to recall all that Gandalf had said to him. But for this \\nchoice he could recall no counsel. Indeed Gandalf s guidance had been taken \\nfrom them too soon, too soon, while the Dark Land was still very far away. \\nHow they should enter it at the last Gandalf had not said. Perhaps he could \\nnot say. Into the stronghold of the Enemy in the North, into Dol Guldur, he \\nhad once ventured. But into Mordor, to the Mountain of Fire and to \\nBarad-dyr, since the Dark Lord rose in power again, had he ever journeyed \\nthere? Frodo did not think so. And here he was a little halfling from the \\nShire, a simple hobbit of the quiet countryside expected to find a way where \\nthe great ones could not go, or dared not go. It was an evil fate. But he \\nhad taken it on himself in his own sitting-room in the far-off spring of \\nanother year, so remote now that it was like a chapter in a story of the \\nworld\\'s youth, when the Trees of Silver and Gold were still in bloom. This \\nwas an evil choice. Which way should he choose? And if both led to terror \\nand death, what good lay in choice? \\n\\nThe day drew on. A deep silence fell upon the little grey hollow where \\nthey lay, so near to the borders of the land of fear: a silence that could \\nbe felt, as if it were a thick veil that cut them off from all the world \\nabout them. Above them was a dome of pale sky barred with fleeting smoke, \\nbut it seemed high and far away, as if seen through great deeps of air heavy \\nwith brooding thought. \\n\\nNot even an eagle poised against the sun would have marked the hobbits \\nsitting there, under the weight of doom, silent, p not moving, shrouded in \\ntheir thin grey cloaks. For a moment he might have paused to consider \\nGollum, a tiny figure sprawling on the ground: there perhaps lay the \\nfamished skeleton of some child of Men, its ragged garment still clinging to \\nit, its long arms and legs almost bone -white and bone-thin: no flesh worth a \\npeck. \\n\\nFrodo\\'s head was bowed over his knees, but Sam leaned back, with hands \\nbehind his head, staring out of his hood at the empty sky. At least for a \\nlong while it was empty. Then presently Sam thought he saw a dark bird-like \\nfigure wheel into the circle of his sight, and hover, and then wheel away \\nagain. Two more followed, and then a fourth. They were very small to look \\nat, yet he knew, somehow, that they were huge, with a vast stretch of \\npinion, flying at a great height. He covered his eyes and bent forward, \\ncowering. The same warning fear was on him as he had felt in the presence of \\nthe Black Riders, the helpless horror that had come with the cry in the wind \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand the shadow on the moon, though now it was not so crushing or compelling: \\nthe menace was more remote. But menace it was. Frodo felt it too. His \\nthought was broken. He stirred and shivered, but he did not look up. Gollum \\nhuddled himself together like a cornered spider. The winged shapes wheeled, \\nand stooped swiftly down, speeding back to Mordor. \\n\\nSam took a deep breath. \\'The Riders are about again, up in the air,\\' he \\nsaid in a hoarse whisper. \\'I saw them. Do you think they could see us? They \\nwere very high up. And if they are Black Riders same as before, then they \\ncan\\'t see much by daylight, can they? \\' \\n\\n\\'No, perhaps not,\\' said Frodo. \\'But their steeds could see. And these \\nwinged creatures that they ride on now, they can probably see more than any \\nother creature. They are like great carrion birds. They are looking for \\nsomething: the Enemy is on the watch, I fear.\\' \\n\\nThe feeling of dread passed, but the enfolding silence was broken. For \\nsome time they had been cut off from the world, as if in an invisible \\nisland; now they were laid bare again, peril had returned. But still Frodo \\ndid not speak to Gollum or make his choice. His eyes were closed, as if he \\nwere dreaming, or looking inward into his heart and memory. At last he \\nstirred and stood up, and it seemed that he was about to speak and to \\ndecide. But \\'hark!\\' he said. \\'What is that?\\' \\n\\nA new fear was upon them. They heard singing and hoarse shouting. At \\nfirst it seemed a long way off, but it drew nearer: it was coming towards \\nthem. It leaped into all their minds that the Black Wings had spied them and \\nhad sent armed soldiers to seize them: no speed seemed too great for these \\nterrible servants of Sauron. They crouched, listening. The voices and the \\nclink of weapons and harness were very close. Frodo and Sam loosened their \\nsmall swords in their sheaths. Flight was impossible. \\n\\nGollum rose slowly and crawled insect-like to the lip of the hollow. \\n\\nVery cautiously he raised himself inch by inch, until he could peer over it \\nbetween two broken points of stone. He remained there without moving for \\nsome time, making no sound. Presently the voices began to recede again, and \\nthen they slowly faded away. Far off a horn blew on the ramparts of the \\nMorannon. Then quietly Gollum drew back and slipped down into the hollow. \\n\\n\\'More Men going to Mordor,\\' he said in a low voice. \\'Dark faces. We \\nhave not seen Men like these before, no, Smjagol has not. They are fierce. \\nThey have black eyes, and long black hair, and gold rings in their ears; \\nyes, lots of beautiful gold. And some have red paint on their cheeks, and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nred cloaks; and their flags are red, and the tips of their spears; and they \\nhave round shields, yellow and black with big spikes. Not nice; very cruel \\nwicked Men they look. Almost as bad as Ores, and much bigger. Smjagol \\nthinks \\n\\nthey have come out of the South beyond the Great River\\'s end: they came up \\nthat road. They have passed on to the Black Gate; but more may follow. \\nAlways more people coming to Mordor. One day all the peoples will be \\ninside.\\' \\n\\n\\'Were there any oliphaunts?\\' asked Sam, forgetting his fear in his \\neagerness for news of strange places. \\n\\n\\'No, no oliphaunts. What are oliphaunts? \\' said Gollum. \\n\\nSam stood up, putting his hands behind his back (as he always did when \\n\\'speaking poetry\\'), and began: \\n\\nGrey as a mouse, \\n\\nBig as a house. \\n\\nNose like a snake, \\n\\nI make the earth shake, \\n\\nAs I tramp through the grass; \\n\\nTrees crack as I pass. \\n\\nWith horns in my mouth \\nI walk in the South, \\n\\nFlapping big ears. \\n\\nBeyond count of years \\nI stump round and round, \\n\\nNever lie on the ground, \\n\\nNot even to die. \\n\\nOliphaunt am I, \\n\\nBiggest of all, \\n\\nHuge, old, and tall. \\n\\nIf ever you\\'d met me \\nYou wouldn \\'t forget me. \\n\\nIf you never do, \\n\\nYou won\\'t think I\\'m true; \\n\\nBut old Oliphaunt am I, \\n\\nAnd I never lie. \\n\\n\\'That,\\' said Sam, when he had finished reciting, \\'that\\'s a rhyme we \\nhave in the Shire. Nonsense maybe, and maybe not. But we have our tales too, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand news out of the South, you know. In the old days hobbits used to go on \\ntheir travels now and again. Not that many ever came back, and not that all \\nthey said was believed: news from Bree , and not sure as Shiretalk, as the \\nsayings go. But I\\'ve heard tales of the big folk down away in the Sunlands. \\nSwertings we call \\'em in our tales; and they ride on oliphaunts, \\'tis said, \\nwhen they fight. They put houses and towers on the oliphauntses backs and \\nall, and the oliphaunts throw rocks and trees at one another. So when you \\nsaid \"Men out of the South, all in red and gold;\" I said \"were there any \\noliphaunts? \" For if there was, I was going to take a look, risk or no. But \\nnow I don\\'t suppose I\\'ll ever see an oliphaunt. Maybe there ain\\'t no such a \\nbeast.\\' He sighed. \\n\\n\\'No, no oliphaunts,\\' said Gollum again. \\'Smjagol has not heard of them. \\n\\nHe does not want to see them. He does not want them to be. Smjagol wants to \\ngo away from here and hide somewhere safer. Smjagol wants master to go. \\nNice \\n\\nmaster, won\\'t he come with Smjagol? \\' \\n\\nFrodo stood up. He had laughed in the midst of all his cares when Sam \\ntrotted out the old fireside rhyme of Oliphaunt , and the laugh had released \\nhim from hesitation. \\'I wish we had a thousand oliphaunts with Gandalf on a \\nwhite one at their head,\\' he said. \\'Then we\\'d break a way into this evil \\nland, perhaps. But we\\'ve not; just our own tired legs, that\\'s all. Well, \\nSmjagol, the third turn may turn the best. I will come with you.\\' \\n\\n\\'Good master, wise master, nice master!\\' cried Gollum in delight, \\npatting Frodo\\'s knees. \\'Good master! Then rest now, nice hobbits, under the \\nshadow of the stones, close under the stones ! Rest and lie quiet, till the \\nYellow Face goes away. Then we can go quickly. Soft and quick as shadows \\nwe \\n\\nmust be!\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 4 . Of Herbs and Stewed Rabbit \\n\\n\\n\\nFor the few hours of daylight that were left they rested, shifting into \\nthe shade as the sun moved, until at last the shadow of the western rim of \\ntheir dell grew long, and darkness filled all the hollow. Then they ate a \\nlittle, and drank sparingly. Gollum ate nothing, but he accepted water \\ngladly. \\n\\n\\'Soon get more now,\\' he said, licking his lips. \\'Good water runs down \\nin streams to the Great River, nice water in the lands we are going to. \\nSmjagol will get food there too, perhaps. He\\'s very hungry, yes, gollumV He \\nset his two large flat hands on his shrunken belly, and a pale green light \\ncame into his eyes. \\n\\nThe dusk was deep when at length they set out, creeping over the \\nwestward rim of the dell, and fading like ghosts into the broken country on \\nthe borders of the road: The moon was now three nights from the full, but it \\ndid not climb over the mountains until nearly midnight, and the early night \\nwas very dark. A single red light burned high up in the Towers of the Teeth, \\nbut otherwise no sign could be seen or heard of the sleepless watch on the \\nMorannon. \\n\\nFor many miles the red eye seemed to stare at them as they fled, \\nstumbling through a barren stony country. They did not dare to take the \\nroad, but they kept it on their left, following its line as well as they \\ncould at a little distance. At last, when night was growing old and they \\nwere already weary, for they had taken only one short rest, the eye dwindled \\nto a small fiery point and then vanished: they had turned the dark northern \\nshoulder of the lower mountains and were heading southwards. \\n\\nWith hearts strangely lightened they now rested again, but not for \\nlong. They were not going quick enough for Gollum. By his reckoning it was \\nnearly thirty leagues from the Morannon to the cross-roads above Osgiliath, \\nand he hoped to cover that distance in four journeys. So soon they struggled \\non once more, until the dawn began to spread slowly in the wide grey \\nsolitude. They had then walked almost eight leagues; and the hobbits could \\nnot have gone any further, even if they had dared. \\n\\nThe growing light revealed to them a land already, less barren and \\nruinous. The mountains still loomed up ominously on their left, but near at \\nhand they could see the southward road, now bearing away from the black \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nroots of the hills and slanting westwards. Beyond it were slopes covered \\nwith sombre trees like dark clouds, but all about them lay a tumbled \\nheathland, grown with ling and broom and cornel, and other shrubs that they \\ndid not know. Here and there they saw knots of tall pine-trees. The hearts \\nof the hobbits rose again a little in spite of weariness: the air was fresh \\nand fragrant, and it reminded them of the uplands of the Northfarthing far \\naway. It seemed good to be reprieved, to walk in a land that had only been \\nfor a few years under the dominion of the Dark Lord and was not yet fallen \\nwholly into decay. But they did not forget their danger, nor the Black Gate \\nthat was still all too near, hidden though it was behind the gloomy heights. \\nThey looked about for a hiding-place where they could shelter from evil eyes \\nwhile the light lasted. \\n\\nThe day passed uneasily. They lay deep in the heather and counted out \\nthe slow hours, in which there seemed little change; for they were still \\nunder the shadows of the Ephel D(r)ath, and the sun was veiled. Frodo slept at \\ntimes, deeply and peacefully, either trusting Gollum or too tired to trouble \\nabout him; but Sam found it difficult to do more than doze, even when Gollum \\nwas plainly fast asleep, whiffling and twitching in his secret dreams. \\nHunger, perhaps, more than mistrust kept him wakeful: he had begun to long \\nfor a good homely meal, \\'something hot out of the pot\\'. \\n\\nAs soon as the land faded into a formless grey under coming night, they \\nstarted out again. In a little while Gollum led them down on to the \\nsouthward road; and after that they went on more quickly, though the danger \\nwas greater. Their ears were strained for the sound of hoof or foot on the \\nroad ahead, or following them from behind; but the night passed, and they \\nheard no sound of walker or rider. \\n\\nThe road had been made in a long lost time: and for perhaps thirty \\nmiles below the Morannon it had been newly repaired, but as it went south \\nthe wild encroached upon it. The handiwork of Men of old could still be seen \\nin its straight sure flight and level course: now and again it cut its way \\nthrough hillside slopes, or leaped over a stream upon a wide shapely arch of \\nenduring masonry; but at last all signs of stonework faded, save for a \\nbroken pillar here and there, peering out of bushes at the side, or old \\npaving-stones still lurking amid weeds and moss. Heather and trees and \\nbracken scrambled down and overhung the banks, or sprawled out over the \\nsurface. It dwindled at last to a country cart-road little used; but it did \\nnot wind: it held on its own sure course and guided them by the swiftest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nway. \\n\\nSo they passed into the northern marches of that land that Men once \\ncalled Ithilien, a fair country of climbing woods and swift -falling streams. \\n\\nThe night became fine under star and round moon, and it seemed to the \\nhobbits that the fragrance of the air grew as they went forward; and from \\nthe blowing and muttering of Gollum it seemed that he noticed it too, and \\ndid not relish it. At the first signs of day they halted again. They had \\ncome to the end of a long cutting, deep, and sheer-sided in the middle, by \\nwhich the road clove its way through a stony ridge. Now they climbed up the \\nwestward bank and looked abroad. \\n\\nDay was opening in the sky, and they saw that the mountains were now \\nmuch further off, receding eastward in a long curve that was lost in the \\ndistance. Before them, as they turned west, gentle slopes ran down into dim \\nhazes far below. All about them were small woods of resinous trees, fir and \\ncedar and cypress, and other kinds unknown in the Shire, with wide glades \\namong them; and everywhere there was a wealth of sweet-smelling herbs and \\nshrubs. The long journey from Rivendell had brought them far south of their \\nown land, but not until now in this more sheltered region had the hobbits \\nfelt the change of clime. Here Spring was already busy about them: fronds \\npierced moss and mould, larches were green-fingered, small flowers were \\nopening in the turf, birds were singing. Ithilien, the garden of Gondor now \\ndesolate kept still a dishevelled dryad loveliness. \\n\\nSouth and west it looked towards the warm lower vales of Anduin, \\nshielded from the east by the Ephel D(r)ath and yet not under the \\nmountain-shadow, protected from the north by the Emyn Muil, open to the \\nsouthern airs and the moist winds from the Sea far away. Many great trees \\ngrew there, planted long ago, falling into untended age amid a riot of \\ncareless descendants; and groves and thickets there were of tamarisk and \\npungent terebinth, of olive and of bay; and there were junipers and myrtles; \\nand thymes that grew in bushes, or with their woody creeping stems mantled \\nin deep tapestries the hidden stones; sages of many kinds putting forth blue \\nflowers, or red, or pale green; and marjorams and new-sprouting parsleys, \\nand many herbs of forms and scents beyond the garden-lore of Sam. The grots \\nand rocky walls were already starred with saxifrages and stonecrops. \\nPrimeroles and anemones were awake in the filbert -brakes; and asphodel and \\nmany lily -flowers nodded their half-opened heads in the grass: deep green \\ngrass beside the pools, where falling streams halted in cool hollows on \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntheir journey down to Anduin. \\n\\nThe travellers turned their backs on the road and went downhill. As \\nthey walked, brushing their way through bush and herb, sweet odours rose \\nabout them. Gollum coughed and retched; but the hobbits breathed deep, and \\nsuddenly Sam laughed, for heart\\'s ease not for jest. They followed a stream \\nthat went quickly down before them. Presently it brought them to a small \\nclear lake in a shallow dell: it lay in the broken ruins of an ancient stone \\nbasin, the carven rim of which was almost wholly covered with mosses and \\nrose-brambles; iris-swords stood in ranks about it. and water-lily leaves \\nfloated on its dark gently-rippling surface; but it was deep and fresh, and \\nspilled ever softly out over a stony lip at the far end. \\n\\nHere they washed themselves and drank their fill at the in-falling \\nfreshet. Then they sought for a resting-place, and a hiding-place: for this \\nland, fair-seeming still, was nonetheless now territory of the Enemy. They \\nhad not come very far from the road, and yet even in so short a space they \\nhad seen scars of the old wars, and the newer wounds made by the Ores and \\nother foul servants of the Dark Lord: a pit of uncovered filth and refuse; \\ntrees hewn down wantonly and left to die, with evil runes or the fell sign \\nof the Eye cut in rude strokes on their bark. \\n\\nSam scrambling below the outfall of the lake, smelling and touching the \\nunfamiliar plants and trees, forgetful for the moment of Mordor, was \\nreminded suddenly of their ever-present peril. He stumbled on a ring still \\nscorched by fire, and in the midst of it he found a pile of charred and \\nbroken bones and skulls. The swift growth of the wild with briar and \\neglantine and trailing clematis was already drawing a veil over this place \\nof dreadful feast and slaughter; but it was not ancient. He hurried back to \\nhis companions, but he said nothing: the bones were best left in peace and \\nnot pawed and routed by Gollum. \\n\\n\\'Let\\'s find a place to lie up in,\\' he said. \\'Not lower down. Higher up \\nfor me.\\' \\n\\nA little way back above the lake they found a deep brown bed of last \\nyear\\'s fern. Beyond it was a thicket of dark -leaved bay-trees climbing up a \\nsteep bank that was crowned with old cedars. Here they decided to rest and \\npass the day, which already promised to be bright and warm. A good day for \\nstrolling on their way along the groves and glades of Ithilien; but though \\nOres may shun the sunlight, there were too many places here where they could \\nlie hid and watch; and other evil eyes were abroad: Sauron had many \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nservants. Gollum, in any case, would not move under the Yellow. Face. Soon \\nit would look over the dark ridges of the Ephel D(r)ath, and he would faint \\nand cower in the light and heat. \\n\\nSam had been giving earnest thought to food as they marched. Now that \\nthe despair of the impassable Gate was behind him, he did not feel so \\ninclined as his master to take no thought for their livelihood beyond the \\nend of their errand; and anyway it seemed wiser to him to save the waybread \\nof the Elves for worse times ahead. Six days or more had passed since he \\nreckoned that they had only a bare supply for three weeks. \\n\\n\\'If we reach the Fire in that time, we\\'ll be lucky at this rate ! \\' he \\nthought. \\'And we might be wanting to get back. We might! \\' \\n\\nBesides, at the end of a long night-march, and after bathing and \\ndrinking, he felt even more hungry than usual. A supper, or a breakfast, by \\nthe fire in the old kitchen at Bagshot Row was what he really wanted. An \\nidea struck him and he turned to Gollum. Gollum had just begun to sneak off \\non his own, and he was crawling away on all fours through the fern. \\n\\n\\'Hi! Gollum! \\' said Sam. \\'Where are you going? Hunting? Well see here, \\nold noser, you don\\'t like our food, and I\\'d not be sorry for a change \\nmyself. Your new motto\\'s always ready to help. Could you find anything fit \\nfor a hungry hobbit? \\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, perhaps, yes,\\' said Gollum. \\'Smjagol always helps, if they asks \\n-- if they asks nicely.\\' \\n\\n\\'Right!\\' said Sam \\'I does ask. And if that isn\\'t nice enough, I begs.\\' \\n\\nGollum disappeared. He was away some time, and Frodo after a few \\nmouthfuls of lembas settled deep into the brown fern and went to sleep. Sam \\nlooked at him. The early daylight was only just creeping down into the \\nshadows under the trees, but he saw his master\\'s face very clearly, and his \\nhands, too, lying at rest on the ground beside him. He was reminded suddenly \\nof Frodo as he had lain, asleep in the house of Elrond, after his deadly \\nwound. Then as he had kept watch Sam had noticed that at times a light \\nseemed to be shining faintly within; but now the light was even clearer and \\nstronger. Frodo\\'s face was peaceful, the marks of fear and care had left it; \\nbut it looked old, old and beautiful, as if the chiselling of the shaping \\nyears was now revealed in many fine lines that had before been hidden, \\nthough the identity of the face was not changed. Not that Sam Gamgee put it \\nthat way to himself. He shook his head, as if finding words useless, and \\nmurmured: \\'I love him. He\\'s like that, and sometimes it shines through, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsomehow. But I love him, whether or no.\\' \\n\\nGollum returned quietly and peered over Sam\\'s shoulder. Looking at \\nFrodo, he shut his eyes and crawled away without a sound. Sam came to him \\nmoment later and found him chewing something and muttering to himself. \\nOn \\n\\nthe ground beside him lay two small rabbits, which he was beginning to eye \\ngreedily. \\n\\n\\'Smjagol always helps,\\' he said. \\'He has brought rabbits, nice rabbits. \\n\\nBut master has gone to sleep, and perhaps Sam wants to sleep. Doesn\\'t want \\nrabbits now? Smjagol tries to help, but he can\\'t catch things all in a \\nminute.\\' \\n\\nSam, however, had no objection to rabbit at all, and said so. At least \\nnot to cooked rabbit. All hobbits, of course, can cook, for they begin to \\nlearn the art before their letters (which many never reach): but Sam was a \\ngood cook, even by hobbit reckoning, and he had done a good deal of the \\ncamp-cooking on their travels, when there was a chance. He still hopefully \\ncarried some of his gear in his pack: a small tinder-box, two small shallow \\npans, the smaller fitting into the larger; inside them a wooden spoon, a \\nshort two-pronged fork and some skewers were stowed; and hidden at the \\nbottom of the pack in a flat wooden box a dwindling treasure, some salt. But \\nhe needed a fire, and other things besides. He thought for a bit, while he \\ntook out his knife, cleaned and whetted it, and began to dress the rabbits. \\n\\nHe was not going to leave Frodo alone asleep even for a few minutes. \\n\\n\\'Now, Gollum,\\' he said, \\'I\\'ve another job for you. Go and fill these \\npans with water, and bring \\'em back! \\' \\n\\n\\'Smjagol will fetch water, yes,\\' said Gollum. \\'But what does the hobbit \\nwant all that water for? He has drunk, he has washed.\\' \\n\\n\\'Never you mind,\\' said Sam. \\'If you can\\'t guess, you\\'ll soon find out. \\n\\nAnd the sooner you fetch the water, the sooner you\\'ll learn. Don\\'t you \\ndamage one of my pans, or I\\'ll carve you into mincemeat.\\' \\n\\nWhile Gollum was away Sam took another look at Frodo. He was still \\nsleeping quietly, but Sam was now struck most by the leanness of his face \\nand hands. \\'Too thin and drawn he is,\\' he muttered. \\'Not right for a hobbit. \\n\\nIf I can get these coneys cooked, I\\'m going to wake him up.\\' \\n\\nSam gathered a pile of the driest fern, and then scrambled up the bank \\ncollecting a bundle of twigs and broken wood; the fallen branch of a cedar \\nat the top gave him a good supply. He cut out some turves at the foot of the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbank just outside the fern-brake, and made a shallow hole and laid his fuel \\nin it. Being handy with flint and tinder he soon had a small blaze going. It \\nmade little or no smoke but gave off an aromatic scent. He was just stooping \\nover his fire, shielding it and building it up with heavier wood, when \\nGollum returned, carrying the pans carefully and grumbling to himself. \\n\\nHe set the pans down, and then suddenly saw what Sam was doing. He gave \\na thin hissing shriek, and seemed to be both frightened and angry. \\'Ach! Sss \\n-- no!\\' he cried. \\'No! Silly hobbits, foolish, yes foolish! They mustn\\'t do \\nit!\\' \\n\\n\\'Mustn\\'t do what?\\' asked Sam in surprise. \\n\\n\\'Not make the nassty red tongues,\\' hissed Gollum. \\'Fire, fire! It\\'s \\ndangerous, yes it is. It burns, it kills. And it will bring enemies, yes it \\nwill.\\' \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t think so,\\' said Sam. \\'Don\\'t see why it should, if you don\\'t \\nput wet stuff on it and make a smother. But if it does, it does. I\\'m going \\nto risk it, anyhow. I\\'m going to stew these coneys.\\' \\n\\n\\'Stew the rabbits!\\' squealed Gollum in dismay. \\'Spoil beautiful meat \\nSmjagol saved for you, poor hungry Smjagol! What for? What for, silly \\nhobbit? They are young, they are tender, they are nice. Eat them, eat them!\\' \\n\\nHe clawed at the nearest rabbit, already skinned and lying by the fire. \\n\\n\\'Now, now! \\' said Sam. \\'Each to his own fashion. Our bread chokes you, \\nand raw coney chokes me. If you give me a coney, the coney\\'s mine, see, to \\ncook, if I have a mind. And I have. You needn\\'t watch me. Go and catch \\nanother and eat it as you fancy -- somewhere private and out o\\' my sight. \\nThen you won\\'t see the fire, and I shan\\'t see you, and we\\'ll both be the \\nhappier. I\\'ll see the fire don\\'t smoke, if that\\'s any comfort to you.\\' \\n\\nGollum withdrew grumbling, and crawled into the fern. Sam busied \\nhimself with his pans. \\'What a hobbit needs with coney,\\' he said to himself, \\n\\n\\'is some herbs and roots, especially taters -- not to mention bread. Herbs \\nwe can manage, seemingly.\\' \\n\\n\\'Gollum!\\' he called softly. \\'Third time pays for all. I want some \\nherbs.\\' Gollum\\'s head peeped out of the fern, but his looks were neither \\nhelpful nor friendly. \\'A few bay-leaves, some thyme and sage, will do -- \\nbefore the water boils,\\' said Sam. \\n\\n\\'No! \\' said Gollum. \\'Smjagol is not pleased. And Smjagol doesn\\'t like \\nsmelly leaves. He doesn\\'t eat grasses or roots, no precious, not till he\\'s \\nstarving or very sick, poor Smjagol. \\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Smjagol\\'ll get into real true hot water, when this water boils, if he \\ndon\\'t do as he\\'s asked,\\' growled Sam. \\'Sam\\'llput his head in it, yes \\nprecious. And I\\'d make him look for turnips and carrots, and taters too, if \\nit was the time o\\' the year. I\\'ll bet there\\'s all sorts of good things \\nrunning wild in this country. I\\'d give a lot for half a dozen taters.\\' \\n\\n\\'Smjagol won\\'t go, O no precious, not this time,\\' hissed Gollum. \\'He\\'s \\nfrightened, and he\\'s very tired, and this hobbit\\'s not nice, not nice at \\nall. Smjagol won\\'t grub for roots and carrotses and -- taters. What\\'s \\ntaters, precious, eh, what\\'s taters? \\n\\n\\'Po-ta-toes,\\' said Sam. \\'The Gaffer\\'s delight, and rare good ballast \\nfor an empty belly. But you won\\'t find any, so you needn\\'t look. But be good \\nSmjagol and fetch me the herbs, and I\\'ll think better of you. What\\'s more, \\nif you turn over a new leaf, and keep it turned, I\\'ll cook you some taters \\none of these days. I will: fried fish and chips served by S. Gamgee. You \\ncouldn\\'t say no to that.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, yes we could. Spoiling nice fish, scorching it. Give me fish now, \\nand keep nassty chips ! \\' \\n\\n\\'Oh you\\'re hopeless,\\' said Sam. \\'Go to sleep!\\' \\n\\nIn the end he had to find what he wanted for himself; but he did not \\nhave to go far, not out of sight of the place where his master lay, still \\nsleeping. For a while Sam sat musing, and tending the fire till the water \\nboiled. The daylight grew and the air became warm; the dew faded off turf \\nand leaf. Soon the rabbits cut up lay simmering in their pans with the \\nbunched herbs. Almost Sam fell asleep as the time went by. He let them stew \\nfor close on an hour, testing them now and again with his fork, and tasting \\nthe broth. \\n\\nWhen he thought all was ready he lifted the pans off the fire, and \\ncrept along to Frodo. Frodo half opened his eyes as Sam stood over him, and \\nthen he wakened from his dreaming: another gentle, unrecoverable dream of \\npeace. \\n\\n\\'Hullo, Sam! \\' he said. \\'Not resting? Is anything wrong? What is the \\ntime? \\' \\n\\n\\'About a couple of hours after daybreak,\\' said Sam, \\'and nigh on half \\npast eight by Shire clocks, maybe. But nothing\\'s wrong. Though it ain\\'t \\nquite what I\\'d call right: no stock, no onions, no taters. I\\'ve got a bit of \\na stew for you, and some broth, Mr. Frodo. Do you good. You\\'ll have to sup \\nit in your mug; or straight from the pan, when it\\'s cooled a bit. I haven\\'t \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbrought no bowls, nor nothing proper.\\' \\n\\nFrodo yawned and stretched. \\'You should have been resting Sam,\\' he \\nsaid. \\'And lighting a fire was dangerous in these parts. But I do feel \\nhungry. Hmm! Can I smell it from here? What have you stewed? \\' \\n\\n\\'A present from Smjagol,\\' said Sam: \\'a brace o\\' young coneys; though I \\nfancy Gollum\\'s regretting them now. But there\\'s nought to go with them but a \\nfew herbs.\\' \\n\\nSam and his master sat just within the fern-brake and ate their stew \\nfrom the pans, sharing the old fork and spoon. They allowed themselves half \\na piece of the Elvish waybread each. It seemed a feast. \\n\\n\\'Wheew! Gollum! \\' Sam called and whistled softly. \\'Come on! Still time \\nto change your mind. There\\'s some left, if you want to try stewed coney.\\' \\nThere was no answer. \\n\\n\\'Oh well, I suppose he\\'s gone off to find something for himself. We\\'ll \\nfinish it,\\' said Sam. \\n\\n\\'And then you must take some sleep,\\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'Don\\'t you drop off, while I\\'m nodding, Mr. Frodo. I don\\'t feel too \\nsure of him. There\\'s a good deal of Stinker -the bad Gollum, if you \\nunderstand me-in him still, and it\\'s getting stronger again. Not but what I \\nthink he\\'d try to throttle me first now. We don\\'t see eye to eye, and he\\'s \\nnot pleased with Sam, O no precious, not pleased at all.\\' \\n\\nThey finished, and Sam went off to the stream to rinse his gear. As he \\nstood up to return, he looked back up the slope. At that moment he saw the \\nsun rise out of the reek, or haze, or dark shadow, or whatever it was, that \\nlay ever to the east, and it sent its golden beams down upon the trees and \\nglades about him. Then he noticed a thin spiral of blue-grey, smoke, plain \\nto see as it caught the sunlight, rising from a thicket above him. With a \\nshock he realized that this was the smoke from his little cooking-fire, \\nwhich he had neglected to put out. \\n\\n\\'That won\\'t do! Never thought it would show like that! \\' he muttered, \\nand he started to hurry back. Suddenly he halted and listened. Flad he heard \\na whistle or not? Or was it the call of some strange bird? If it was a \\nwhistle, it did not come from Frodo\\'s direction. There it went again from \\nanother place! Sam began to run as well as he could uphill. \\n\\nHe found that a small brand, burning away to its outer end, had kindled \\nsome fern at the edge of the fire, and the fern blazing up had set the \\nturves smouldering. Hastily he stamped out what was left of the fire, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nscattered the ashes, and laid the turves on the hole. Then he crept back to \\nFrodo. \\n\\n\\'Did you hear a whistle, and what sounded like an answer? \\' he asked. \\n\\n\\'A few minutes back. I hope it was only a bird, but it didn\\'t sound quite \\nlike that: more like somebody mimicking a bird-call, I thought. And I\\'m \\nafraid my bit of fire\\'s been smoking. Now if I\\'ve gone and brought trouble, \\n\\nI\\'ll never forgive myself. Nor won\\'t have a chance, maybe! \\' \\n\\n\\'Hush! \\' whispered Frodo. \\'I thought I heard voices.\\' \\n\\nThe two hobbits trussed their small packs, put them on ready for \\nflight, and then crawled deeper into the fern. There they crouched \\nlistening. \\n\\nThere was no doubt of the voices. They were speaking low and furtively, \\nbut they were near, and coming nearer. Then quite suddenly one spoke clearly \\nclose at hand. \\n\\n\\'Here! Here is where the smoke came from! \\' it said. \\'Twill be nigh at \\nhand. In the fern, no doubt. We shall have it like a coney in a trap. Then \\nwe shall learn what kind of thing it is.\\' \\n\\n\\'Aye, and what it knows! \\' said a second voice. \\n\\nAt once four men came striding through the fern from different \\ndirections. Since flight and hiding were no longer possible, Frodo and Sam \\nsprang to their feet, putting back to back and whipping out their small \\nswords. \\n\\nIf they were astonished at what they saw, their captors were even more \\nastonished. Four tall Men stood there. Two had spears in their hands with \\nbroad bright heads. Two had great bows, almost of their own height, and \\ngreat quivers of long green -feathered arrows. All had swords at their sides, \\nand were clad in green and brown of varied hues, as if the better to walk \\nunseen in the glades of Ithilien. Green gauntlets covered their hands, and \\ntheir faces were hooded and masked with green, except for their eyes, which \\nwere very keen and bright. At once Frodo thought of Boromir, for these Men \\nwere like him in stature and bearing, and in their manner of speech. \\n\\n\\'We have not found what we sought,\\' said one. \\'But what have we found? \\n\\nf \\n\\n\\'Not Ores,\\' said another, releasing the hilt of his sword, which he had \\nseized when he saw the glitter of Sting in Frodo\\'s hand. \\n\\n\\'Elves? \\' said a third, doubtfully. \\n\\n\\'Nay! Not Elves,\\' said the fourth, the tallest, and as it appeared the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchief among them. \\'Elves do not walk in Ithilien in these days. And Elves \\nare wondrous fair to look upon, or so \\'tis said.\\' \\n\\n\\'Meaning we\\'re not, I take you,\\' said Sam. \\'Thank you kindly. And when \\nyou\\'ve finished discussing us, perhaps you\\'ll say who you are, and why you \\ncan\\'t let two tired travellers rest.\\' \\n\\nThe tall green man laughed grimly. \\'I am Faramir, Captain of Gondor,\\' \\nhe said. \\'But there are no travellers in this land: only the servants of the \\nDark Tower, or of the White.\\' \\n\\n\\'But we are neither,\\' said Frodo. \\'And travellers we are, whatever \\nCaptain Faramir may say.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then make haste to declare yourselves and your errand,\\' said Faramir. \\n\\n\\'We have a work to do, and this is no time or place for riddling or \\nparleying. Come! Where is the third of your company? \\' \\n\\n\\'The third? \\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, the skulking fellow that we saw with his nose in the pool down \\nyonder. He had an ill-favoured look. Some spying breed of Ore, I guess, or a \\ncreature of theirs. But he gave us the slip by some fox-trick.\\' \\n\\n\\'I do not know where he is,\\' said Frodo. \\'He is only a chance companion \\nmet upon our road; and I am not answerable for him. If you come on him, \\nspare him. Bring him or send him to us. He is only a wretched gangrel \\ncreature, but I have him under my care for a while. But as for us, we are \\nHobbits of the Shire, far to the North and West, beyond many rivers. Frodo \\nson of Drogo is my name, and with me is Samwise son of Hamfast, a worthy \\nhobbit in my service. We have come by long ways -- out of Rivendell, or \\nImladris as some call it.\\' Here Faramir started and grew intent. \\'Seven \\ncompanions we had: one we lost at Moria, the others we left at Parth Galen \\nabove Rauros: two of my kin; a Dwarf there was also, and an Elf, and two \\nMen. They were Aragorn; and Boromir, who said that he came out of Minas \\nTirith, a city in the South.\\' \\n\\n\\'Boromir! \\' all the four men exclaimed. \\n\\n\\'Boromir son of the Ford Denethor?\\' said Faramir, and a strange stern \\nlook came into his face. \\'You came with him? That is news indeed, if it be \\ntrue. Know, little strangers, that Boromir son of Denethor was High Warden \\nof the White Tower, and our Captain-General: sorely do we miss him. Who are \\nyou then, and what had you to do with him? Be swift, for the Sun is \\nclimbing!\\' \\n\\n\\'Are the riddling words known to you that Boromir brought to Rivendell? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\' Frodo replied. \\n\\nSeek for the Sword that was Broken. \\n\\nIn Imladris it dwells. \\n\\n\\'The words are known indeed,\\' said Faramir in astonishment. v It is some \\ntoken of your truth that you also know them.\\' \\n\\n\\'Aragorn whom I named is the bearer of the Sword that was Broken,\\' said \\nFrodo. \\'And we are the Halflings that the rhyme spoke of.\\' \\n\\n\\'That I see,\\' said Faramir thoughtfully. \\'Or I see that it might be so. \\n\\nAnd what is Isildur\\'s Bane? \\' \\n\\n\\'That is hidden,\\' answered Frodo. \\'Doubtless it will be made clear in \\ntime.\\' \\n\\n\\'We must learn more of this,\\' said Faramir, \\'and know what brings you \\nso far east under the shadow of yonder--,\\' he pointed and said no name. \\'But \\nnot now. We have business in hand. You are in peril, and you would not have \\ngone far by field or road this day. There will be hard handstrokes nigh at \\nhand ere the day is full. Then death, or swift flight bark to Anduin. I will \\nleave two to guard you, for your good and for mine. Wise man trusts not to \\nchance-meeting on the road in this land. If I return, I will speak more with \\nyou.\\' \\n\\n\\'Farewell!\\' said Frodo, bowing low. \\'Think what you will, I am a friend \\nof all enemies of the One Enemy. We would go with you, if we halfling folk \\ncould hope to serve you, such doughty men and strong as you seem, and if my \\nerrand permitted it. May the light shine on your swords!\\' \\n\\n\\'The Halflings are courteous folk, whatever else they be,\\' said \\nFaramir. \\'Farewell!\\' \\n\\nThe hobbits sat down again, but they said nothing to one another of \\ntheir thoughts and doubts. Close by, just under the dappling shadow of the \\ndark bay-trees, two men remained on guard. They took off their masks now and \\nagain to cool them, as the day-heat grew, and Frodo saw that they were \\ngoodly men, pale-skinned, dark of hair, with grey eyes and faces sad and \\nproud. They spoke together in soft voices, at first using the Common Speech, \\nbut after the manner of older days, and then changing to another language of \\ntheir own. To his amazement, as he listened Frodo became aware that it was \\nthe Elven-tongue that they spoke, or one but little different; and he looked \\nat them with wonder, for he knew then that they must be D(r)nedain of the \\nSouth, men of the line of the Lords of Westernesse. \\n\\nAfter a while he spoke to them; but they were slow and cautious in \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nanswering. They named themselves Mablung and Damrod, soldiers of Gondor, \\nand \\n\\nthey were Rangers of Ithilien; for they were descended from folk who lived \\nin Ithilien at one time, before it was overrun. From such men the Lord \\nDenethor chose his forayers, who crossed the Anduin secretly (how or where, \\nthey would not say) to harry the Ores and other enemies that roamed between \\nthe Ephel D(r)ath and the River. \\n\\n\\'It is close on ten leagues hence to the east-shore of Anduin,\\' said \\nMablung, \\'and we seldom come so far afield. But we have a new errand on this \\njourney: we come to ambush the Men of Harad. Curse them! \\' \\n\\n\\'Aye, curse the Southrons! \\' said Damrod. \\' \\'Tis said that there were \\ndealings of old between Gondor and the kingdoms of the Harad in the Far \\nSouth; though there was never friendship. In those days our bounds were away \\nsouth beyond the mouths of Anduin, and Umbar, the nearest of their realms, \\nacknowledged our sway. But that is long since. \\'Tis many lives of Men since \\nany passed to or fro between us. Now of late we have learned that the Enemy \\nhas been among them, and they are gone over to Him, or back to Him-they \\nwere \\n\\never ready to His will -as have so many also in the East. I doubt not that \\nthe days of Gondor are numbered, and the walls of Minas Tirith are doomed, \\nso great is His strength and malice.\\' \\n\\n\\'But still we will not sit idle and let Him do all as He would,\\' said \\nMablung. \\'These cursed Southrons come now marching up the ancient roads \\nto \\n\\nswell the hosts of the Dark Tower. Yea, up the very roads that craft of \\nGondor made. And they go ever more heedlessly, we learn, thinking that the \\npower of their new master is great enough, so that the mere shadow of His \\nhills will protect them. We come to teach them another lesson. Great \\nstrength of them was reported to us some days ago, marching north. One of \\ntheir regiments is due by our reckoning to pass by, some time ere noon-up on \\nthe road above, where it passes through the cloven way. The road may pass, \\nbut they shall not! Not while Faramir is Captain. He leads now in all \\nperilous ventures. But his life is charmed, or fate spares him for some \\nother end.\\' \\n\\nTheir talk died down into a listening silence. All seemed still and \\nwatchful. Sam, crouched by the edge of the fern-brake, peered out. With his \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nkeen hobbit-eyes he saw that many more Men were about. He could see \\nthem \\n\\nstealing up the slopes, singly or in long files, keeping always to the shade \\nof grove or thicket, or crawling, hardly visible in their brown and green \\nraiment, through grass and brake. All were hooded and masked, and had \\ngauntlets on their hands, and were armed like Faramir and his companions. \\nBefore long they had all passed and vanished. The sun rose till it neared \\nthe South. The shadows shrank. \\n\\n\\'I wonder where that dratted Gollum is? \\' thought Sam, as he crawled \\nback into deeper shade. \\'He stands a fair chance of being spitted for an \\nOre, or of being roasted by the Yellow Face. But I fancy he\\'ll look after \\nhimself.\\' He lay down beside Frodo and began to doze. \\n\\nHe woke, thinking that he had heard horns blowing. He sat up. It was \\nnow high noon. The guards stood alert and tense in the shadow of the trees. \\nSuddenly the horns rang out louder and beyond mistake from above, over the \\ntop of the slope. Sam thought that he heard cries and wild shouting also, \\nbut the sound was faint, as if it came out of some distant cave. Then \\npresently the noise of fighting broke out near at hand, just above their \\nhiding-place. He could hear plainly the ringing grate of steel on steel, the \\nclang of sword on iron cap, the dull beat of blade on shield; men were \\nyelling and screaming, and one clear loud voice was calling Gondorl Gondorl \\n\\n\\'It sounds like a hundred blacksmiths all smithying together,\\' said Sam \\nto Frodo. \\'They\\'re as near as I want them now.\\' \\n\\nBut the noise grew closer. \\'They are coming!\\' cried Damrod. \\'See! Some \\nof the Southrons have broken from the trap and are flying from the road. \\nThere they go! Our men after them, and the Captain leading.\\' \\n\\nSam, eager to see more, went now and joined the guards. He scrambled a \\nlittle way up into one of the larger of the bay-trees. For a moment he \\ncaught a glimpse of swarthy men in red running down the slope some way off \\nwith green-clad warriors leaping after them, hewing them down as they fled. \\nArrows were thick in the air. Then suddenly straight over the rim of their \\nsheltering bank, a man fell, crashing through the slender trees, nearly on \\ntop of them. He came to rest in the fern a few feet away, face downward, \\ngreen arrow-feathers sticking from his neck below a golden collar. His \\nscarlet robes were tattered, his corslet of overlapping brazen plates was \\nrent and hewn, his black plaits of hair braided with gold were drenched with \\nblood. His brown hand still clutched the hilt of a broken sword. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was Sam\\'s first view of a battle of Men against Men, and he did not \\nlike it much. He was glad that he could not see the dead face. He wondered \\nwhat the man\\'s name was and where he came from; and if he was really evil of \\nheart, or what lies or threats had led him on the long march from his home; \\nand if he would not really rather have stayed there in peace -all in a flash \\nof thought which was quickly driven from his mind. For just as Mablung \\nstepped towards the fallen body, there was a new noise. Great crying and \\nshouting. Amidst it Sam heard a shrill bellowing or trumpeting. And then a \\ngreat thudding and bumping, like huge rams dinning on the ground. \\n\\n\\'Ware! Ware!\\' cried Damrod to his companion. \\'May the Valar turn him \\naside! Mymak! Mymak!\\' \\n\\nTo his astonishment and terror, and lasting delight, Sam saw a vast \\nshape crash out of the trees and come careering down the slope. Big as a \\nhouse, much bigger than a house, it looked to him, a grey-clad moving hill. \\nFear and wonder, maybe, enlarged him in the hobbit\\'s eyes, but the Mymak of \\nHarad was indeed a beast of vast bulk, and the like of him does not walk now \\nin Middle-earth; his kin that live still in latter days are but memories of \\nhis girth and majesty. On he came, straight towards the watchers, and then \\nswerved aside in the nick of time, passing only a few yards away, rocking \\nthe ground beneath their feet: his great legs like trees, enormous sail-like \\nears spread out, long snout upraised like a huge serpent about to strike, \\nhis small red eyes raging. His upturned hornlike tusks were bound with bands \\nof gold and dripped with blood. His trappings of scarlet and gold flapped \\nabout him in wild tatters. The ruins of what seemed a very war-tower lay \\nupon his heaving back, smashed in his furious passage through the woods; and \\nhigh upon his neck still desperately clung a tiny figure-the body of a \\nmighty warrior, a giant among the Swertings. \\n\\nOn the great beast thundered, blundering in blind wrath through pool \\nand thicket. Arrows skipped and snapped harmlessly about the triple hide of \\nhis flanks. Men of both sides fled before him, but many he overtook and \\ncrushed to the ground. Soon he was lost to view, still trumpeting and \\nstamping far away. What became of him Sam never heard: whether he escaped \\nto \\n\\nroam the wild for a time, until he perished far from his home or was trapped \\nin some deep pit; or whether he raged on until he plunged in the Great River \\nand was swallowed up. \\n\\nSam drew a deep breath. \\'An Oliphaunt it was!\\' he said. \\'So there are \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOliphaunts, and I have seen one. What a life! But no one at home will ever \\nbelieve me. Well, if that\\'s over, I\\'ll have a bit of sleep.\\' \\n\\n\\'Sleep while you may,\\' said Mablung. \\'But the Captain will return, if \\nhe is unhurt; and when he comes we shall depart swiftly. We shall be pursued \\nas soon as news of our deed reaches the Enemy, and that will not be long.\\' \\n\\n\\'Go quietly when you must!\\' said Sam. \\'No need to disturb my sleep. I \\nwas walking all night.\\' \\n\\nMablung laughed. \\'I do not think the Captain will leave you here, \\nMaster Samwise,\\' he said. \\'But you shall see.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 5 . The Window on the West \\n\\n\\n\\nIt seemed to Sam that he had only dozed for a few minutes when he awoke \\nto find that it was late afternoon and Faramir had come back. He had brought \\nmany men with him; indeed all the survivors of the foray were now gathered \\non the slope nearby, two or three hundred strong. They sat in a wide \\nsemicircle, between the arms of which Faramir was seated on the ground, \\nwhile Frodo stood before him. It looked strangely like the trial of a \\nprisoner. \\n\\nSam crept out from the fern, but no one paid any attention to him, and \\nhe placed himself at the end of the rows of men, where he could see and hear \\nall that was going on. He watched and listened intently, ready to dash to \\nhis master\\'s aid if needed. He could see Faramir\\'s face, which was now \\nunmasked: it was stern and commanding, and a keen wit lay behind his \\nsearching glance. Doubt was in the grey eyes that gazed steadily at Frodo. \\n\\nSam soon became aware that the Captain was not satisfied with Frodo\\'s \\naccount of himself at several points: what part he had to play in the \\nCompany that set out from Rivendell; why he had left Boromir; and where he \\nwas now going. In particular he returned often to Isildur\\'s Bane. Plainly he \\nsaw that Frodo was concealing from him some matter of great importance. \\n\\n\\'But it was at the coming of the Halfling that Isildur\\'s Bane should \\nwaken, or so one must read the words,\\' he insisted. \\'If then you are the \\nHalfling that was named, doubtless you brought this thing, whatever it may \\nbe, to the Council of which you speak, and there Boromir saw it. Do you deny \\nit? \\' \\n\\nFrodo made no answer. \\'So! \\' said Faramir. V I wish then to learn from \\nyou more of it; for what concerns Boromir concerns me. An ore-arrow slew \\nIsildur, so far as old tales tell. But ore-arrows are plenty, and the sight \\nof one would not be taken as a sign of Doom by Boromir of Gondor. Had you \\nthis thing in keeping? It is hidden, you say; but is not that because you \\nchoose to hide it? \\' \\n\\n\\'No, not because I choose,\\' answered Frodo. v It does not belong to me. \\n\\nIt does not belong to any mortal, great or small; though if any could claim \\nit, it would be Aragorn son of Arathorn, whom I named, the leader of our \\nCompany from Moria to Rauros.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Why so, and not Boromir, prince of the City that the sons of Elendil \\nfounded? \\' \\n\\n\\'Because Aragorn is descended in direct lineage, father to father, from \\nIsildur Elendil\\'s son himself. And the sword that he bears was Elendil\\'s \\nsword.\\' \\n\\nA murmur of astonishment ran through all the ring of men. Some cried \\naloud: \\'The sword of Elendil! The sword of Elendil comes to Minas Tirith! \\nGreat tidings! \\' But Faramir\\'s face was unmoved. \\n\\n\\'Maybe,\\' he said. \\'But so great a claim will need to be established and \\nclear proofs will be required, should this Aragorn ever come to Minas \\nTirith. He had not come, nor any of your Company, when I set out six days \\nago.\\' \\n\\n\\'Boromir was satisfied of that claim,\\' said Frodo. \\'Indeed, if Boromir \\nwere here, he would answer all your questions. And since he was already at \\nRauros many days back, and intended then to go straight to your city, if you \\nreturn, you may soon learn the answers there. My part in the Company was \\nknown to him, as to all the others, for it was appointed to me by Elrond of \\nImladris himself before the whole Council. On that errand I came into this \\ncountry, but it is not mine to reveal to any outside the Company. Yet those \\nwho claim to oppose the Enemy would do well not to hinder it.\\' \\n\\nFrodo\\'s tone was proud, whatever he felt, and Sam approved of it; but \\nit did not appease Faramir. \\n\\n\\'So!\\' he said. \\'You bid me mind my own affairs, and get me back home, \\nand let you be. Boromir will tell all, when he comes. When he comes, say \\nyou! Were you a friend of Boromir?\\' \\n\\nVividly before Frodo\\'s mind came the memory of Boromir\\'s assault upon \\nhim, and for a moment he hesitated. Faramir\\'s eyes watching him grew harder. \\n\\'Boromir was a valiant member of our Company \\' said Frodo at length. \\'Yes, I \\nwas his friend, for my part.\\' \\n\\nFaramir smiled grimly. \\'Then you would grieve to learn that Boromir is \\ndead? \\' \\n\\n\\'I would grieve indeed,\\' said Frodo. Then catching the look in \\nFaramir\\'s eyes, he faltered. \\'Dead?\\' he said. \\'Do you mean that he is dead, \\nand that you knew it? You have been trying to trap me in words, playing with \\nme? Or are you now trying to snare me with a falsehood?\\' \\n\\n\\'I would not snare even an ore with a falsehood,\\' said Faramir. \\n\\n\\'How then did he die, and how do you know of it? Since you say that \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnone of the Company had reached the city when you left.\\' \\n\\n\\'As to the manner of his death, I had hoped that his friend and \\ncompanion would tell me how it was.\\' \\n\\n\\'But he was alive and strong when we parted. And he lives still for all \\nthat I know. Though surely there are many perils in the world.\\' \\n\\n\\'Many indeed,\\' said Faramir, \\'and treachery not the least.\\' \\n\\nSam had been getting more and more impatient and angry at this \\nconversation. These last words were more than he could bear, and bursting \\ninto the middle of the ring, he strode up to his master\\'s side. \\n\\n\\'Begging your pardon, Mr. Frodo,\\' he said, \\'but this has gone on long \\nenough. Tie\\'s no right to talk to you so. After all you\\'ve gone through, as \\nmuch for his good and all these great Men as for anyone else. \\n\\n\\'See here, Captain! \\' He planted himself squarely in front of Faramir \\nhis hands on his hips, and a look on his face as if he was addressing a \\nyoung hobbit who had offered him what he called \\'sauce\\' when questioned \\nabout visits to the orchard. There was some murmuring, but also some grins \\non the faces of the men looking on: the sight of their Captain sitting on \\nthe ground and eye to eye with a young hobbit, legs well apart, bristling \\nwith wrath, was one beyond their experience. \\'See here! \\' he said. \\'What are \\nyou driving at? Let\\'s come to the point before all the Ores of Mordor come \\ndown on us! If you think my master murdered this Boromir and then ran away, \\nyou\\'ve got no sense; but say it, and have done! And then let us know what \\nyou mean to do about it. But it\\'s a pity that folk as talk about fighting \\nthe Enemy can\\'t let others do their bit in their own way without \\ninterfering. He\\'d be mighty pleased, if he could see you now. Think he\\'d got \\na new friend, he would.\\' \\n\\n\\'Patience!\\' said Faramir, but without anger. \\'Do not speak before your \\nmaster, whose wit is greater than yours. And I do not need any to teach me \\nof our peril. Even so, I spare a brief time, in order to judge justly in a \\nhard matter. Were I as hasty as you, I might have slain you long ago. For I \\nam commanded to slay all whom I find in this land without the leave of the \\nLord of Gondor. But I do not slay man or beast needlessly, and not gladly \\neven when it is needed. Neither do I talk in vain. So be comforted. Sit by \\nyour master, and be silent! \\' \\n\\nSam sat down heavily with a red face. Faramir turned to Frodo again: \\n\\n\\'You asked how do I know that the son of Denethor is dead. Tidings of death \\nhave many wings. Night oft brings news to near kindred, \\'tis said. Boromir \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwas my brother.\\' \\n\\nA shadow of sorrow passed over his face. \\'Do you remember aught of \\nspecial mark that the Lord Boromir bore with him among his gear?\\' \\n\\nFrodo thought for a moment, fearing some further trap, and wondering \\nhow this debate would turn in the end. He had hardly saved the Ring from the \\nproud grasp of Boromir, and how he would fare now among so many men, \\nwarlike \\n\\nand strong, he did not know. Yet he felt in his heart that Faramir, though \\nhe was much like his brother in looks, was a man less self-regarding, both \\nsterner and wiser. \\'I remember that Boromir bore a horn,\\' he said at last. \\n\\n\\'You remember well, and as one who has in truth seen him,\\' said \\nFaramir. \\'Then maybe you can see it in your mind\\'s eye: a great horn of the \\nwild ox of the East, bound with silver, and written with ancient characters. \\n\\nThat horn the eldest son of our house has borne for many generations; and it \\nis said that if it be blown at need anywhere within the bounds of Gondor, as \\nthe realm was of old, its voice will not pass unheeded. \\n\\n\\'Five days ere I set out on this venture, eleven days ago at about this \\nhour of the day, I heard the blowing of that horn: from the northward it \\nseemed, but dim, as if it were but an echo in the mind. A boding of ill we \\nthought it, my father and I, for no tidings had we heard of Boromir since he \\nwent away, and no watcher on our borders had seen him pass. And on the third \\nnight after another and a stranger thing befell me. \\n\\n\\'I sat at night by the waters of Anduin, in the grey dark under the \\nyoung pale moon, watching the ever -moving stream; and the sad reeds were \\nrustling. So do we ever watch the shores nigh Osgiliath, which our enemies \\nnow partly hold, and issue from it to harry our lands. But that night all \\nthe world slept at the midnight hour. Then I saw, or it seemed that I saw, a \\nboat floating on the water, glimmering grey, a small boat of a strange \\nfashion with a high prow, and there was none to row or steer it. \\n\\n\\'An awe fell on me, for a pale light was round it. But I rose and went \\nto the bank, and began to walk out into the stream, for I was drawn towards \\nit. Then the boat turned towards me, and stayed its pace, and floated slowly \\nby within my hand\\'s reach, yet I durst not handle it. It waded deep, as if \\nit were heavily burdened, and it seemed to me as it passed under my gaze \\nthat it was almost filled with clear water, from which came the light; and \\nlapped in the water a warrior lay asleep. \\n\\n\\'A broken sword was on his knee. I saw many wounds on him. It was \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBoromir, my brother, dead. I knew his gear, his sword, his beloved face. One \\nthing only I missed: his horn. One thing only I knew not: a fair belt, as it \\nwere of linked golden leaves, about his waist. Boromir! I cried. Where is \\nthy horn? Whither goest thou? O Boromir! But he was gone. The boat turned \\ninto the stream and passed glimmering on into the night. Dreamlike it was. \\nand yet no dream, for there was no waking. And I do not doubt that he is \\ndead and has passed down the River to the Sea.\\' \\n\\n\\'Alas!\\' said Frodo. That was indeed Boromir as I knew him. For the \\ngolden belt was given to him in Lothlurien by the Lady Galadriel. She it was \\nthat clothed us as you see us, in elven-grey. This brooch is of the same \\nworkmanship.\\' Fie touched the green and silver leaf that fastened his cloak \\nbeneath his throat. \\n\\nFaramir looked closely at it. Tt is beautiful,\\' he said. \\'Yes, \\'tis \\nwork of the same craft. So then you passed through the Land of Lurien? \\nLaurelindurenan it was named of old, but long now it has lain beyond the \\nknowledge of Men,\\' he added softly, regarding Frodo with a new wonder in his \\neyes. \\'Much that was strange about you I begin now to understand. Will you \\nnot tell me more? For it is a bitter thought that Boromir died, within sight \\nof the land of his home.\\' \\n\\n\\'No more can I say than I have said,\\' answered Frodo. \\'Though your tale \\nfills me with foreboding. A vision it was that you saw, I think, and no \\nmore, some shadow of evil fortune that has been or will be. Unless indeed it \\nis some lying trick of the Enemy. I have seen the faces of fair warriors of \\nold laid in sleep beneath the pools of the Dead Marshes, or seeming so by \\nhis foul arts.\\' \\n\\n\\'Nay, it was not so,\\' said Faramir. \\'For his works fill the heart with \\nloathing; but my heart was filled with grief and pity.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yet how could such a thing have happened in truth? \\' asked Frodo. \\'For \\nno boat could have been carried over the stony hills from Tol Brandir; and \\nBoromir purposed to go home across the Entwash and the fields of Rohan. \\n\\nAnd \\n\\nyet how could any vessel ride the foam of the great falls and not founder in \\nthe boiling pools, though laden with water? \\' \\n\\n\\'I know not,\\' said Faramir. \\'But whence came the boat? \\' \\n\\n\\'From Lurien,\\' said Frodo. \\'In three such boats we rowed down Anduin to \\nthe Falls. They also were of elven-work.\\' \\n\\n\\'You passed through the Hidden Land,\\' said Faramir, \\'but it seems that \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyou little understood its power. If Men have dealings with the Mistress of \\nMagic who dwells in the Golden Wood, then they may look for strange things \\nto follow. For it is perilous for mortal man to walk out of the world of \\nthis Sun, and few of old came thence unchanged, \\'tis said. \\n\\n\\' Boromir , O Boromir!\\' he cried. \"What did she say to you, the Lady that \\ndies not? What did she see? What woke in your heart then? Why went you ever \\nto Laurelindurenan, and came not by your own road, upon the horses of \\nRohan \\n\\nriding home in the morning?\\' \\n\\nThen turning again to Frodo, he spoke in a quiet voice once more. To \\nthose questions I guess that you could make some answer, Frodo son of Drogo. \\nBut not here or now. maybe. But lest you still should think my tale a \\nvision, I will tell you this. The horn of Boromir at least returned in \\ntruth, and not in seeming. The horn came, but it was cloven in two, as it \\nwere by axe or sword. The shards came severally to shore: one was found \\namong the reeds where watchers of Gondor lay, northwards below the infalls \\nof the Entwash; the other was found spinning on the flood by one who had an \\nerrand in the water. Strange chances, but murder will out, \\'tis said. \\n\\n\\'And now the horn of the elder son lies in two pieces upon the lap of \\nDenethor, sitting in his high chair, waiting for news. And you can tell me \\nnothing of the cleaving of the horn? \\' \\n\\n\\'No, I did not know of it,\\' said Frodo. \\'But the day when you heard it \\nblowing, if your reckoning is true, was the day when we parted, when I and \\nmy servant left the Company. And now your tale fills me with dread. For if \\nBoromir was then in peril and was slain, I must fear that all my companions \\nperished too. And they were my kindred and my friends. \\n\\n\\'Will you not put aside your doubt of me and let me go? I am weary, and \\nfull of grief, and afraid. But I have a deed to do, or to attempt, before I \\ntoo am slain. And the more need of haste, if we two halflings are all that \\nremain of our fellowship. \\n\\n\\'Go back, Faramir, valiant Captain of Gondor, and defend your city \\nwhile you may, and let me go where my doom takes me.\\' \\n\\n\\'For me there is no comfort in our speech together,\\' said Faramir; \\'but \\nyou surely draw from it more dread than need be. Unless the people of Lurien \\nthemselves came to him, who arrayed Boromir as for a funeral? Not Ores or \\nservants of the Nameless. Some of your Company, I guess, live still. \\n\\n\\'But whatever befell on the North March, you, Frodo, I doubt no longer. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf hard days have made me any judge of Men\\'s words and faces, then I may \\nmake a guess at Halflings! Though,\\' and now he smiled, There is something \\nstrange about you, Frodo, an elvish air, maybe. But more lies upon our words \\ntogether than I thought at first. I should now take you back to Minas Tirith \\nto answer there to Denethor, and my life will justly be forfeit, if I now \\nchoose a course that proves ill for my city. So I will not decide in haste \\nwhat is to be done. Yet we must move hence without more delay.\\' \\n\\nHe sprang to his feet and issued some orders. At once the men who were \\ngathered round him broke up into small groups, and went off this way and \\nthat, vanishing quickly into the shadows of the rocks and trees. Soon only \\nMablung and Damrod remained. \\n\\n\\'Now you, Frodo and Samwise, will come with me and my guards,\\' said \\nFaramir. v You cannot go along the road southwards, if that was your purpose. \\nIt will be unsafe for some days, and always more closely watched after this \\naffray than it has been yet. And you cannot, I think, go far today in any \\ncase, for you are weary. And so are we. We are going now to a secret place \\nwe have, somewhat less than ten miles from here. The Ores and spies of the \\nEnemy have not found it yet, and if they did, we could hold it long even \\nagainst many. There we may lie up and rest for a while, and you with us. In \\nthe morning I will decide what is best for me to do, and for you.\\' \\n\\nThere was nothing for Frodo to do but to fall in with this request, or \\norder. It seemed in any case a wise course for the moment, since this foray \\nof the men of Gondor had made a journey in Ithilien more dangerous than \\never. \\n\\nThey set out at once: Mablung and Damrod a little ahead, and Faramir \\nwith Frodo and Sam behind. Skirting the hither side of the pool where the \\nhobbits had bathed, they crossed the stream, climbed a long bank, and passed \\ninto green-shadowed woodlands that marched ever downwards and \\nwestwards. \\n\\nWhile they walked, as swiftly as the hobbits could go, they talked in hushed \\nvoices. \\n\\n\\'I broke off our speech together,\\' said Faramir, \\'not only because time \\npressed, as Master Samwise had reminded me, but also because we were \\ndrawing \\n\\nnear to matters that were better not debated openly before many men. It was \\nfor that reason that I turned rather to the matter of my brother and let be \\nIsildur\\'s Bane. You were not wholly frank with me, Frodo.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'I told no lies, and of the truth all I could,\\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'I do not blame you,\\' said Faramir. \\'You spoke with skill in a hard \\nplace, and wisely, it seemed to me. But I learned or guessed more from you \\nthan your words said. You were not friendly with Boromir, or you did not \\npart in friendship. You, and Master Samwise, too, I guess have some \\ngrievance. Now I loved him dearly, and would gladly avenge his death, yet I \\nknew him well. Isildur\\'s Bane -- I would hazard that Isildur\\'s Bane lay \\nbetween you and was a cause of contention in your Company. Clearly it is a \\nmighty heirloom of some sort, and such things do not breed peace among \\nconfederates, not if aught may be learned from ancient tales. Do I not hit \\nnear the mark?\\' \\n\\n\\'Near,\\' said Frodo, \\'but not in the gold. There was no contention in \\nour Company, though there was doubt: doubt which way we should take from \\nthe \\n\\nEmyn Muil. But be that as it may, ancient tales teach us also the peril of \\nrash words concerning such things as -- heirlooms.\\' \\n\\n\\'Ah, then it is as I thought: your trouble was with Boromir alone. Fie \\nwished this thing brought to Minas Tirith. Alas! it is a crooked fate that \\nseals your lips who saw him last, and holds from me that which I long to \\nknow: what was in his heart and thought in his latest hours. Whether he \\nerred or no, of this I am sure: he died well, achieving some good thing. His \\nface was more beautiful even than in life. \\n\\n\\'But, Frodo, I pressed you hard at first about Isildur\\'s Bane. Forgive \\nme! It was unwise in such an hour and place. I had not had time for thought. \\nWe had had a hard fight, and there was more than enough to fill my mind. But \\neven as I spoke with you, I drew nearer to the mark, and so deliberately \\nshot wider. For you must know that much is still preserved of ancient lore \\namong the Rulers of the city that is not spread abroad. We of my house are \\nnot of the line of Elendil. though the blood of N(r)menor is in us. For we \\nreckon back our line to Mardil, the good steward, who ruled in the king\\'s \\nstead when he went away to war. And that was King Edrnur, last of the line \\nof Anbrion, and childless, and he came never back. And the stewards have \\ngoverned the city since that day, though it was many generations of Men ago. \\n\\n\\'And this I remember of Boromir as a boy, when we together learned the \\ntale of our sires and the history of our city, that always it displeased him \\nthat his father was not king. \"How many hundreds of years needs it to make a \\nsteward a king, if the king returns not? \" he asked. \"Few years, maybe, in \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nother places of less royalty,\" my father answered. \"In Gondor ten thousand \\nyears would not suffice.\" Alas! poor Boromir. Does that not tell you \\nsomething of him? \\' \\n\\n\\'It does,\\' said Frodo. \\'Yet always he treated Aragorn with honour.\\' \\n\\n\\'I doubt it not,\\' said Faramir. \\'If he were satisfied of Aragorn\\'s \\nclaim as you say, he would greatly reverence him. But the pinch has not yet \\ncome. They had not yet reached Minas Tirith or become rivals in her wars. \\n\\n\\'But I stray. We in the house of Denethor know much ancient lore by \\nlong tradition, and there are moreover in our treasuries many things \\npreserved: books and tablets writ on withered parchments, yea, and on stone, \\nand on leaves of silver and of gold, in divers characters. Some none can now \\nread; and for the rest, few ever unlock them. I can read a little in them, \\nfor I have had teaching. It was these records that brought the Grey Pilgrim \\nto us. I first saw him when I was a child, and he has been twice or thrice \\nsince then.\\' \\n\\n\\'The Grey Pilgrim? \\' said Frodo. \\'Had he a name?\\' \\n\\n\\'Mithrandir we called him in elf-fashion,\\' said Faramir, \\'and he was \\ncontent. Many are my names in many countries , he said. Mithrandir among the \\nElves, Tharkyn to the Dwarves; Olurin I was in my youth in the West that is \\nforgotten, in the South Incbnus, in the North Gandalf; to the East I go \\nnot.\\' \\n\\n\\'Gandalf!\\' said Frodo. \\'I thought it was he. Gandalf the Grey dearest \\nof counsellors. Leader of our Company. He was lost in Moria.\\' \\n\\n\\'Mithrandir was lost! \\' said Faramir. \\'An evil fate seems to have \\npursued your fellowship. It is hard indeed to believe that one of so great \\nwisdom, and of power -- for many wonderful things he did among us -- could \\nperish, and so much lore be taken from the world. Are you sure of this, and \\nthat he did not just leave you and depart where he would? \\' \\n\\n\\'Alas! yes,\\' said Frodo. \\'I saw him fall into the abyss.\\' \\n\\n\\'I see that there is some great tale of dread in this.\\' said Faramir \\n\\'which perhaps you may tell me in the evening -time. This Mithrandir was, I \\nnow guess, more than a lore-master: a great mover of the deeds that are done \\nin our time. Had he been among us to consult concerning the hard words of \\nour dream, he could have made them clear to us without need of messenger. \\nYet, maybe, he would not have done so, and the journey of Boromir was \\ndoomed. Mithrandir never spoke to us of what was to be, nor did he reveal \\nhis purposes. He got leave of Denethor, how I do not know, to look at the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsecrets of our treasury, and I learned a little of him, when he would teach \\n(and that was seldom). Ever he would search and would question us above all \\nelse concerning the Great Battle that was fought upon Dagorlad in the \\nbeginning of Gondor, when He whom we do not name was overthrown. And \\nhe was \\n\\neager for stories of Isildur, though of him we had less to tell; for nothing \\ncertain was ever known among us of his end.\\' \\n\\nNow Faramir\\'s voice sank to a whisper. \\'But this much I learned or \\nguessed, and I have kept it ever secret in my heart since: that Isildur took \\nsomewhat from the hand of the Unnamed, ere he went away from Gondor, \\nnever \\n\\nto be seen among mortal men again. Here I thought was the answer to \\nMithrandir\\'s questioning. But it seemed then a matter that concerned only \\nthe seekers after ancient learning. Nor when the riddling words of our dream \\nwere debated among us, did I think of Isildur\\'s Bane as being this same \\nthing. For Isildur was ambushed and slain by ore-arrows, according to the \\nonly legend that we knew, and Mithrandir had never told me more. \\n\\n\\'What in truth this Thing is I cannot yet guess; but some heirloom of \\npower and peril it must be. A fell weapon, perchance, devised by the Dark \\nFord. If it were a thing that gave advantage in battle. I can well believe \\nthat Boromir, the proud and fearless, often rash, ever anxious for the \\nvictory of Minas Tirith (and his own glory therein), might desire such a \\nthing and be allured by it. Alas that ever he went on that errand! I should \\nhave been chosen by my father and the elders but he put himself forward, as \\nbeing the older and the hardier (both true), and he would not be stayed. \\n\\n\\'But fear no more! I would not take this thing, if it layby the \\nhighway. Not were Minas Tirith falling in ruin and I alone could save her, \\nso, using the weapon of the Dark Ford for her good and my glory. No. I do \\nnot wish for such triumphs, Frodo son of Drogo.\\' \\n\\n\\'Neither did the Council,\\' said Frodo. \\'Nor do 1. 1 would have nothing \\nto do with such matters.\\' \\n\\n\\'For myself,\\' said Faramir, \\'I would see the White Tree in flower again \\nin the courts of the kings, and the Silver Crown return, and Minas Tirith in \\npeace: Minas Anor again as of old, full of light, high and fair, beautiful \\nas a queen among other queens: not a mistress of many slaves, nay, not even \\na kind mistress of willing slaves. War must be, while we defend our lives \\nagainst a destroyer who would devour all; but I do not love the bright sword \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfor its sharpness, nor the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his \\nglory. I love only that which they defend: the city of the Men of N(r)menor; \\nand I would have her loved for her memory, her ancientry, her beauty, and \\nher present wisdom. Not feared, save as men may fear the dignity of a man, \\nold and wise. \\n\\n\\'So fear me not! I do not ask you to tell me more. I do not even ask \\nyou to tell me whether I now speak nearer the mark. But if you will trust \\nme, it may be that I can advise you in your present quest, whatever that \\nbe-yes, and even aid you.\\' \\n\\nFrodo made no answer. Almost he yielded to the desire for help and \\ncounsel, to tell this grave young man, whose words seemed so wise and fair, \\nall that was in his mind. But something held him back. His heart was heavy \\nwith fear and sorrow: if he and Sam were indeed, as seemed likely, all that \\nwas now left of the Nine Walkers, then he was in sole command of the secret \\nof their errand. Better mistrust undeserved than rash words. And the memory \\nof Boromir, of the dreadful change that the lure of the Ring had worked in \\nhim, was very present to his mind, when he looked at Faramir and listened to \\nhis voice: unlike they were, and yet also much akin. \\n\\nThey walked on in silence for a while, passing like grey and green \\nshadows under the old trees, their feet making no sound; above them many \\nbirds sang, and the sun glistened on the polished roof of dark leaves in the \\nevergreen woods of Ithilien. \\n\\nSam had taken no part in the conversation, though he had listened; and \\nat the same time he had attended with his keen hobbit ears to all the soft \\nwoodland noises about them. One thing he had noted, that in all the talk the \\nname of Gollum had not once come up. He was glad, though he felt that it was \\ntoo much to hope that he would never hear it again. He soon became aware \\nalso that though they walked alone, there were many men close at hand: not \\nonly Damrod and Mablung flitting in and out of the shadows ahead, but others \\non either side, all making their swift secret way to some appointed place. \\n\\nOnce, looking suddenly back, as if some prickle of the skin told him \\nthat he was watched from behind, he thought he caught a brief glimpse of a \\nsmall dark shape slipping behind a tree-trunk. He opened his mouth to speak \\nand shut it again. Tm not sure of it,\\' he said to himself, \\'and why should \\nI remind them of the old villain, if they choose to forget him? I wish I \\ncould!\\' \\n\\nSo they passed on, until the woodlands grew thinner and the land began \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nto fall more steeply. Then they turned aside again, to the right, and came \\nquickly to a small river in a narrow gorge: it was the same stream that \\ntrickled far above out of the round pool, now grown to a swift torrent, \\nleaping down over many stones in a deep-cloven bed, overhung with ilex and \\ndark box- woods. Looking west they could see, below them in a haze of light, \\nlowlands and broad meads, and glinting far off in the westering sun the wide \\nwaters of the Anduin. \\n\\n\\'Here, alas! I must do you a discourtesy,\\' said Faramir. \"I hope you \\nwill pardon it to one who has so far made his orders give way to courtesy as \\nnot to slay you or to bind you. But it is a command that no stranger, not \\neven one of Rohan that fights with us, shall see the path we now go with \\nopen eyes. I must blindfold you.\\' \\n\\n\\'As you will,\\' said Frodo. \\'Even the Elves do likewise at need, and \\nblindfolded we crossed the borders of fair Lothlurien. Gimli the dwarf took \\nit ill, but the hobbits endured it.\\' \\n\\n\\'It is to no place so fair that I shall lead you,\\' said Faramir. \\'But I \\nam glad that you will take this willingly and not by force.\\' \\n\\nHe called softly and immediately Mablung and Damrod stepped out of the \\ntrees and came back to him. \\'Blindfold these guests,\\' said Faramir. \\n\\'Securely, but not so as to discomfort them. Do not tie their hands. They \\nwill give their word not to try and see. I could trust them to shut their \\neyes of their own accord, but eyes will blink, if the feet stumble. Lead \\nthem so that they do not falter.\\' \\n\\nWith green scarves the two guards now bound up the hobbits\\' eyes and \\ndrew their hoods down almost to their mouths; then quickly they took each \\none by the hand and went on their way. All that Frodo and Sam knew of this \\nlast mile of the road they learned from guessing in the dark. After a little \\nthey found that they were on a path descending steeply; soon it grew so \\nnarrow that they went in single file, brushing a stony wall on either side; \\ntheir guards steered them from behind with hands laid firmly on their \\nshoulders. Now and again they came to rough places and were lifted from \\ntheir feet for a while, and then set down again. Always the noise of the \\nrunning water was on their right hand, and it grew nearer and louder. At \\nlength they were halted. Quickly Mablung and Damrod turned them about, \\nseveral times, and they lost all sense of direction. They climbed upwards a \\nlittle: it seemed cold and the noise of the stream had become faint. Then \\nthey were picked up and carried down, down many steps, and round a corner. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSuddenly they heard the water again, loud now, rushing and splashing. All \\nround them it seemed, and they felt a fine rain on their hands and cheeks. \\n\\nAt last they were set on their feet once more. For a moment they stood so, \\nhalf fearful, blindfold, not knowing where they were; and no one spoke. \\n\\nThen came the voice of Faramir close behind. \\'Let them see! \\' he said. \\n\\nThe scarves were removed and their hoods drawn back, and they blinked and \\ngasped. \\n\\nThey stood on a wet floor of polished stone, the doorstep, as it were, \\nof a rough-hewn gate of rock opening dark behind them. But in front a thin \\nveil of water was hung, so near that Frodo could have put an outstretched \\narm into it. It faced westward. The level shafts of the setting sun behind \\nbeat upon it, and the red light was broken into many flickering beams of \\never-changing colour. It was as if they stood at the window of some \\nelven-tower, curtained with threaded jewels of silver and gold, and ruby, \\nsapphire and amethyst, all kindled with an unconsuming fire. \\n\\n\\'At least by good chance we came at the right hour to reward you for \\nyour patience,\\' said Faramir. \\'This is the Window of the Sunset, Henneth \\nAnnyn, fairest of all the falls of Ithilien, land of many fountains. Few \\nstrangers have ever seen it. But there is no kingly hall behind to match it. \\n\\nEnter now and see ! \\' \\n\\nEven as he spoke the sun sank, and the fire faded in the flowing water. \\n\\nThey turned and passed under the low forbidding arch. At once they found \\nthemselves in a rock-chamber, wide and rough, with an uneven stooping roof. \\nA few torches were kindled and cast a dim light on the glistening walls. \\nMany men were already there. Others were still coming in by twos and threes \\nthrough a dark narrow door on one side. As their eyes grew accustomed to the \\ngloom the hobbits saw that the cave was larger than they had guessed and was \\nfilled with great store of arms and victuals. \\n\\n\\'Well, here is our refuge,\\' said Faramir. \\'Not a place of great ease \\nbut here you may pass the night in peace. It is dry at least, and there is \\nfood, though no fire. At one time the water flowed down through this cave \\nand out of the arch, but its course was changed further up the gorge, by \\nworkmen of old, and the stream sent down in a fall of doubled height over \\nthe rocks far above. All the ways into this grot were then sealed against \\nthe entry of water or aught else, all save one. There are now but two ways \\nout: that passage yonder by which you entered blindfold, and through the \\nWindow-curtain into a deep bowl filled with knives of stone. Now rest a \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhile, until the evening meal is set.\\' \\n\\nThe hobbits were taken to a corner and given a low bed to lie on, if \\nthey wished. Meanwhile men busied themselves about the cave, quietly and in \\norderly quickness. Light tables were taken from the walls and set up on \\ntrestles and laden with gear. This was plain and unadorned for the most \\npart, but all well and fairly, made: round platters, bowls and dishes of \\nglazed brown clay or turned box-wood, smooth and clean. Here and there was a \\ncup or basin of polished bronze; and a goblet of plain silver was set by the \\nCaptain\\'s seat in the middle of the inmost table. \\n\\nFaramir went about among the men, questioning each as he came in, in a \\nsoft voice. Some came back from the pursuit of the Southrons; others, left \\nbehind as scouts near the road, came in latest. All the Southrons had been \\naccounted for, save only the great mymak: what happened to him none could \\nsay. Of the enemy no movement could be seen; not even an ore-spy was \\nabroad. \\n\\n\\'You saw and heard nothing, Anborn?\\' Faramir asked of the latest comer. \\n\\n\\'Well, no, lord,\\' said the man. \\'No Ore at least. But I saw, or thought \\nI saw, something a little strange. It was getting deep dusk, when the eyes \\nmake things greater than they should be. So perhaps it may have been no more \\nthan a squirrel.\\' Sam pricked up his ears at this. \\'Yet if so, it was a \\nblack squirrel, and I saw no tail. \\'Twas like a shadow on the ground, and it \\nwhisked behind a tree-trunk when I drew nigh and went up aloft as swift as \\nany squirrel could. You will not have us slay wild beasts for no purpose, \\nand it seemed no more, so I tried no arrow. It was too dark for sure \\nshooting anyway, and the creature was gone into the gloom of the leaves in a \\ntwinkling. But I stayed for a while, for it seemed strange, and then I \\nhastened back. I thought I heard the thing hiss at me from high above as I \\nturned away. A large squirrel, maybe. Perhaps under the shadow of the \\nUnnamed some of the beasts of Mirkwood are wandering hither to our \\nwoods. \\n\\nThey have black squirrels there, \\'tis said.\\' \\n\\n\\'Perhaps,\\' said Faramir. \\'But that would be an ill omen, if it were so. \\n\\nWe do not want the escapes of Mirkwood in Ithilien.\\' Sam fancied that he \\ngave a swift glance towards the hobbits as he spoke; but Sam said nothing. \\n\\nFor a while he and Frodo lay back and watched the torchlight, and the men \\nmoving to and fro speaking in hushed voices. Then suddenly Frodo fell \\nasleep. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSam struggled with himself, arguing this way and that. \\'He may be all \\nright,\\' he thought, \\'and then he may not. Fair speech may hide a foul \\nheart.\\' He yawned. V I could sleep for a week, and I\\'d be better for it. And \\nwhat can I do, if I do keep awake, me all alone, and all these great Men \\nabout? Nothing, Sam Gamgee; but you\\'ve got to keep awake all the same.\\' And \\nsomehow he managed it. The light faded from the cave door, and the grey veil \\nof falling water grew dim and was lost in gathering shadow. Always the sound \\nof the water went on, never changing its note, morning or evening or night. \\n\\nIt murmured and whispered of sleep. Sam stuck his knuckles in his eyes. \\n\\nNow more torches were being lit. A cask of wine was broached. Storage \\nbarrels were being opened. Men were fetching water from the fall. Some were \\nlaving their hands in basins. A wide copper bowl and a white cloth were \\nbrought to Faramir and he washed. \\n\\n\\'Wake our guests,\\' he said, \\'and take them water. It is time to eat.\\' \\n\\nFrodo sat up and yawned and stretched. Sam, not used to being waited \\non, looked with some surprise at the tall man who bowed, holding a basin of \\nwater before him. \\n\\n\\'Put it on the ground, master, if you please! \\' he said. \\'Easier for me \\nand you.\\' Then to the astonishment and amusement of the Men he plunged his \\nhead into the cold water and splashed his neck and ears. \\n\\n\\'Is it the custom in your land to wash the head before supper? \\' said \\nthe man who waited on the hobbits. \\n\\n\\'No, before breakfast,\\' said Sam. \\'But if you\\'re short of sleep cold \\nwater on the neck\\'s like rain on a wilted lettuce. There! Now I can keep \\nawake long enough to eat a bit.\\' \\n\\nThey were led then to seats beside Faramir: barrels covered with pelts \\nand high enough above the benches of the Men for their convenience. Before \\nthey ate, Faramir and all his men turned and faced west in a moment of \\nsilence. Faramir signed to Frodo and Sam that they should do likewise. \\n\\n\\'So we always do.\\' he said, as they sat down: \\'we look towards N(r)menor \\nthat was, and beyond to Elvenhome that is, and to that which is beyond \\nElvenhome and will ever be. Have you no such custom at meat? \\' \\n\\n\\'No,\\' said Frodo, feeling strangely rustic and untutored. \\'But if we \\nare guests, we bow to our host, and after we have eaten we rise and thank \\nhim.\\' \\n\\n\\'That we do also,\\' said Faramir. \\n\\nAfter so long journeying and camping, and days spent XJn the lonely \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwild, the evening meal seemed a feast to the hobbits: to drink pale yellow \\nwine, cool and fragrant, and eat bread and butter, and salted meats, and \\ndried fruits, and good red cheese, with clean hands and clean knives and \\nplates. Neither Frodo nor Sam refused anything that was offered, nor a \\nsecond, nor indeed a third helping. The wine coursed in their veins and \\ntired limbs, and they felt glad and easy of heart as they had not done since \\nthey left the land of Lurien. \\n\\nWhen all was done Faramir led them to a recess at the back of the cave, \\npartly screened by curtains; and a chair and two stools were brought there. \\n\\nA little earthenware lamp burned in a niche. \\n\\n\\'You may soon desire to sleep,\\' he said, \\'and especially good Samwise, \\nwho would not close his eyes before he ate -- whether for fear of blunting \\nthe edge of a noble hunger, or for fear of me, I do not know. But it is not \\ngood to sleep too soon after meat, and that following a fast. Let us talk a \\nwhile. On your journey from Rivendell there must have been many things to \\ntell. And you, too, would perhaps wish to learn something of us and the \\nlands where you now are. Tell me of Boromir my brother, and of old \\nMithrandir, and of the fair people of Lothlurien.\\' \\n\\nFrodo no longer felt sleepy and he was willing to talk. But though the \\nfood and wine had put him at his ease, he had not lost all his caution. Sam \\nwas beaming and humming to himself, but when Frodo spoke he was at first \\ncontent to listen, only occasionally venturing to make an exclamation of \\nagreement. \\n\\nFrodo told many tales, yet always he steered the matter away from the \\nquest of the Company and from the Ring, enlarging rather on the valiant part \\nBoromir had played in all their adventures, with the wolves of the wild, in \\nthe snows under Caradhras, and in the mines of Moria where Gandalf fell. \\nFaramir was most moved by the story of the fight on the bridge. \\n\\n\\'It must have irked Boromir to run from Ores,\\' he said, \\'or even from \\nthe fell thing you name, the Balrog -- even though he was the last to \\nleave.\\' \\n\\n\\'Fie was the last,\\' said Frodo, \\'but Aragorn was forced to lead us. Fie \\nalone knew the way after Gandalf s fall. But had there not been us lesser \\nfolk to care for, I do not think that either he or Boromir would have fled.\\' \\n\\n\\'Maybe, it would have been better had Boromir fallen there with \\nMithrandir,\\' said Faramir, \\'and not gone on to the fate that waited above \\nthe falls of Rauros.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Maybe. But tell me now of your own fortunes,\\' said Frodo, turning the \\nmatter aside once again. \\'For I would learn more of Minas Ithil and \\nOsgiliath, and Minas Tirith the long-enduring. What hope have you for that \\ncity in your long war? \\' \\n\\n\\'What hope have we? \\' said Faramir. \\'It is long since we had any hope. \\n\\nThe sword of Elendil, if it returns indeed, may rekindle it, but I do not \\nthink that it will do more than put off the evil day, unless other help \\nunlooked-for also comes, from Elves or Men. For the Enemy increases and we \\ndecrease. We are a failing people, a springless autumn. \\n\\n\\'The Men of N(r)menor were settled far and wide on the shores and seaward \\nregions of the Great Lands, but for the most part they fell into evils and \\nfollies. Many became enamoured of the Darkness and the black arts; some \\nwere \\n\\ngiven over wholly to idleness and ease, and some fought among themselves, \\nuntil they were conquered in their weakness by the wild men. \\n\\n\\'It is not said that evil arts were ever practised in Gondor, or that \\nthe Nameless One was ever named in honour there; and the old wisdom and \\nbeauty brought out of the West remained long in the realm of the sons of \\nElendil the Fair, and they linger there still. Yet even so it was Gondor \\nthat brought about its own decay, falling by degrees into dotage, and \\nthinking that the Enemy was asleep, who was only banished not destroyed. \\n\\n\\'Death was ever present, because the N(r)menoreans still, as they had in \\ntheir old kingdom, and so lost it, hungered after endless life unchanging. \\n\\nKings made tombs more splendid than houses of the living, and counted old \\nnames in the rolls of their descent dearer than the names of sons. Childless \\nlords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry; in secret chambers withered men \\ncompounded strong elixirs, or in high cold towers asked questions of the \\nstars. And the last king of the line of Anbrion had no heir. \\n\\n\\'But the stewards were wiser and more fortunate. Wiser, for they \\nrecruited the strength of our people from the sturdy folk of the sea -coast, \\nand from the hardy mountaineers of Ered Nimrais. And they made a truce with \\nthe proud peoples of the North, who often had assailed us, men of fierce \\nvalour, but our kin from afar off, unlike the wild Easterlings or the cruel \\nHaradrim. \\n\\n\\'So it came to pass in the days of Cirion the Twelfth Steward (and my \\nfather is the sit and twentieth) that they rode to our aid and at the great \\nField of Celebrant they destroyed our enemies that had seized our northern \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nprovinces. These are the Rohirrim, as we name them, masters of horses, and \\nwe ceded to them the fields of Calenardhon that are since called Rohan; for \\nthat province had long been sparsely peopled. And they became our allies, \\nand have ever proved true to us, aiding us at need, and guarding our \\nnorthern marches and the Gap of Rohan. \\n\\n\\'Of our lore and manners they have learned what they would, and their \\nlords speak our speech at need; yet for the most part they hold by the ways \\nof their own fathers and to their own memories, and they speak among \\nthemselves their own North tongue. And we love them: tall men and fair \\nwomen, valiant both alike, golden-haired, bright-eyed, and strong; they \\nremind us of the youth of Men, as they were in the Elder Days. Indeed it is \\nsaid by our lore-masters that they have from of old this affinity with us \\nthat they are come from those same Three Houses of Men as were the \\nN(r)menoreans in their beginning not from Hador the Goldenhaired, the \\nElf-friend, maybe, yet from such of his sons and people as went not over Sea \\ninto the West, refusing the call. \\n\\n\\'For so we reckon Men in our lore, calling them the High, or Men of the \\nWest, which were N(r)menoreans; and the Middle Peoples, Men of the \\nTwilight, \\n\\nsuch as are the Rohirrim and their kin that dwell still far in the North; \\nand the Wild, the Men of Darkness. \\n\\n\\'Yet now, if the Rohirrim are grown in some ways more like to us, \\nenhanced in arts and gentleness, we too have become more like to them, and \\ncan scarce claim any longer the title High. We are become Middle Men, of the \\nTwilight, but with memory of other things. For as the Rohirrim do, we now \\nlove war and valour as things good in themselves, both a sport and an end; \\nand though we still hold that a warrior should have more skills and \\nknowledge than only the craft of weapons and slaying, we esteem a warrior, \\nnonetheless, above men of other crafts. Such is the need of our days. So \\neven was my brother, Boromir: a man of prowess, and for that he was \\naccounted the best man in Gondor. And very valiant indeed he was: no heir of \\nMinas Tirith has for long years been so hardy in toil, so onward into \\nbattle, or blown a mightier note on the Great Horn.\\' Faramir sighed and fell \\nsilent for a while. \\n\\n\\'You don\\'t say much in all your tales about the Elves, sir,\\' said Sam, \\nsuddenly plucking up courage. He had noted that Faramir seemed to refer to \\nElves with reverence, and this even more than his courtesy, and his food and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwine, had won Sam\\'s respect and quieted his suspicions. \\n\\n\\'No indeed, Master Samwise,\\' said Faramir, \\'for I am not learned in \\nElven-lore. But there you touch upon another point in which we have changed, \\ndeclining from N(r)menor to Middle-earth. For as you may know, if \\nMithrandir \\n\\nwas your companion and you have spoken with Elrond, the Edain, the Fathers \\nof the N(r)menoreans, fought beside the Elves in the first wars, and were \\nrewarded by the gift of the kingdom in the midst of the Sea, within sight of \\nElvenhome. But in Middle-earth Men and Elves became estranged in the days \\nof \\n\\ndarkness, by the arts of the Enemy, and by the slow changes of time in which \\neach kind walked further down their sundered roads. Men now fear and \\nmisdoubt the Elves, and yet know little of them. And we of Gondor grow like \\nother Men, like the men of Rohan; for even they, who are the foes of the \\nDark Lord, shun the Elves and speak of the Golden Wood with dread. \\n\\n\\'Yet there are among us still some who have dealings with the Elves \\nwhen they may, and ever and anon one will go in secret to Lurien, seldom to \\nreturn. Not I. For I deem it perilous now for mortal man wilfully to seek \\nout the Elder People. Yet I envy you that have spoken with the White Lady.\\' \\n\\n\\'The Lady of Lurien! Galadriel!\\' cried Sam. \\'You should see her indeed \\nyou should, sir. I am only a hobbit, and gardening\\'s my job at home, sir, if \\nyou understand me, and I\\'m not much good at poetry -- not at making it: a \\nbit of a comic rhyme, perhaps, now and again, you know, but not real poetry \\n-- so I can\\'t tell you what I mean. It ought to be sung. You\\'d have to get \\nStrider, Aragorn that is, or old Mr. Bilbo, for that. But I wish I could \\nmake a song about her. Beautiful she is, sir! Lovely! Sometimes like a great \\ntree in flower, sometimes like a white daffadowndilly, small and slender \\nlike. Hard as di\\'monds, soft as moonlight. Warm as sunlight, cold as frost \\nin the stars. Proud and far-off as a snow -mountain, and as merry as any lass \\nI ever saw with daisies in her hair in springtime. But that\\'s a lot o\\' \\nnonsense, and all wide of my mark.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then she must be lovely indeed,\\' said Faramir. \\'Perilously fair.\\' \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know about perilous ,\\' said Sam. \\'It strikes me that folk takes \\ntheir peril with them into Lurien, and finds it there because they\\'ve \\nbrought it. But perhaps you could call her perilous, because she\\'s so strong \\nin herself. You, you could dash yourself to pieces on her, like a ship on a \\nrock; or drownd yourself, like a hobbit in a river. But neither rock nor \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nriver would be to blame. Now Boro -- \\' He stopped and went red in the face. \\n\\n\\'Yes? Now Boromir you would say? \\' said Faramir. \\'What would you say? \\nHe took his peril with him? \\' \\n\\n\\'Yes sir, begging your pardon, and a fine man as your brother was if I \\nmay say so. But you\\'ve been warm on the scent all along. Now I watched \\nBoromir and listened to him, from Rivendell all down the road -- looking \\nafter my master, as you\\'ll understand, and not meaning any harm to Boromir \\n-- and it\\'s my opinion that in Lurien he first saw clearly what I guessed \\nsooner: what he wanted. From the moment he first saw it he wanted the \\nEnemy\\'s Ring! \\' \\n\\n\\'Sam! \\' cried Frodo aghast. He had fallen deep into his own thoughts \\nfor a while, and came out of them suddenly and too late. \\n\\n\\'Save me! \\' said Sam turning white, and then flushing scarlet. \\'There I \\ngo again! When ever you open your big mouth you put your foot in it the \\nGaffer used to say to me, and right enough. O dear, O dear! \\n\\n\\'Now look here, sir! \\' He turned, facing up to Faramir with all the \\ncourage that he could muster. \\'Don\\'t you go taking advantage of my master \\nbecause his servant\\'s no better than a fool. You\\'ve spoken very handsome all \\nalong, put me off my guard, talking of Elves and all. But handsome is as \\nhandsome does we say. Now\\'s a chance to show your quality.\\' \\n\\n\\'So it seems,\\' said Faramir, slowly and very softly, with a strange \\nsmile. \\'So that is the answer to all the riddles! The One Ring that was \\nthought to have perished from the world. And Boromir tried to take it by \\nforce? And you escaped? And ran all the way -- to me! And here in the wild I \\nhave you: two halflings, and a host of men at my call, and the Ring of \\nRings. A pretty stroke of fortune! A chance for Faramir, Captain of Gondor, \\nto show his quality! Ha!\\' He stood up, very tall and stern, his grey eyes \\nglinting. \\n\\nFrodo and Sam sprang from their stools and set themselves side by side \\nwith their backs to the wall, fumbling for their sword-hilts. There was a \\nsilence. All the men in the cave stopped talking and looked towards them in \\nwonder. But Faramir sat down again in his chair and began to laugh quietly, \\nand then suddenly became grave again. \\n\\n\\'Alas for Boromir! It was too sore a trial! \\' he said. \\'How you have \\nincreased my sorrow, you two strange wanderers from a far country, bearing \\nthe peril of Men! But you are less judges of Men than I of Halflings. We are \\ntruth-speakers, we men of Gondor. We boast seldom, and then perform, or die \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nin the attempt. Not if I found it on the highway would I take it I said. \\n\\nEven if I were such a man as to desire this thing, and even though I knew \\nnot clearly what this thing was when I spoke, still I should take those \\nwords as a vow, and be held by them. \\n\\n\\'But I am not such a man. Or I am wise enough to know that there are \\nsome perils from which a man must flee. Sit at peace! And be comforted, \\nSamwise. If you seem to have stumbled, think that it was fated to be so. \\n\\nYour heart is shrewd as well as faithful, and saw clearer than your eyes. \\n\\nFor strange though it may seem, it was safe to declare this to me. It may \\neven help the master that you love. It shall turn to his good, if it is in \\nmy power. So be comforted. But do not even name this thing again aloud. Once \\nis enough.\\' \\n\\nThe hobbits came back to their seats and sat very quiet. Men turned \\nback to their drink and their talk, perceiving that their captain had had \\nsome jest or other with the little guests, and that it was over. \\n\\n\\'Well, Frodo, now at last we understand one another,\\' said Faramir. \\'If \\nyou took this thing on yourself, unwilling, at others\\' asking, then you have \\npity and honour from me. And I marvel at you: to keep it hid and not to use \\nit. You are a new people and a new world to me. Are all your kin of like \\nsort? Your land must be a realm of peace and content, and there must \\ngardeners be in high honour.\\' \\n\\n\\'Not all is well there,\\' said Frodo, \\'but certainly gardeners are \\nhonoured.\\' \\n\\n\\'But folk must grow weary there, even in their gardens, as do all \\nthings under the Sun of this world. And you are far from home and wayworn. \\nNo more tonight. Sleep, both of you -- in peace, if you can. Fear not! I do \\nnot wish to see it, or touch it, or know more of it than I know (which is \\nenough), lest peril perchance waylay me and I fall lower in the test than \\nFrodo son of Drogo. Go now to rest -- but first tell me only, if you will, \\nwhither you wish to go, and what to do. For I must watch, and wait, and \\nthink. Time passes. In the morning we must each go swiftly on the ways \\nappointed to us.\\' \\n\\nFrodo had felt himself trembling as the first shock of fear passed. Now \\na great weariness came down on him like a cloud. He could dissemble and \\nresist no longer. \\n\\n\\'I was going to find a way into Mordor,\\' he said faintly. \\'I was going \\nto Gorgoroth. I must find the Mountain of Fire and cast the thing into the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngulf of Doom. Gandalf said so. I do not think I shall ever get there.\\' \\n\\nFaramir stared at him for a moment in grave astonishment. Then suddenly \\nhe caught him as he swayed, and lifting him gently, carried him to the bed \\nand laid him there, and covered him warmly. At once he fell into a deep \\nsleep. \\n\\nAnother bed was set beside him for his servant. Sam hesitated for a \\nmoment, then bowing very low: \\'Good night, Captain, my lord,\\' he said. \\'You \\ntook the chance, sir.\\' \\n\\n\\'Did I so?\\' said Faramir. \\n\\n\\'Yes sir, and showed your quality: the very highest.\\' \\n\\nFaramir smiled. \\'A pert servant, Master Samwise. But nay: the praise of \\nthe praiseworthy is above all rewards. Yet there was naught in this to \\npraise. I had no lure or desire to do other than I have done.\\' \\n\\n\\'Ah well, sir,\\' said Sam, \\'you said my master had an elvish air and \\nthat was good and true. But I can say this: you have an air too, sir, that \\nreminds me of, of -- well, Gandalf, of wizards. \\n\\n\\'Maybe,\\' said Faramir. \\'Maybe you discern from far away the air of \\nN(r)menor. Good night!\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 6 . The Forbidden Pool \\n\\n\\n\\nFrodo woke to find Faramir bending over him. For a second old fears \\nseized him and he sat up and shrank away. \\n\\n\\'There is nothing to fear,\\' said Faramir. \\n\\n\\'Is it morning already? \\' said Frodo yawning. \\n\\n\\'Not yet, but night is drawing to an end, and the full moon is setting. \\n\\nWill you come and see it? Also there is a matter on which I desire your \\ncounsel. I am sorry to rouse you from sleep, but will you come? \\' \\n\\n\\'I will,\\' said Frodo, rising and shivering a little as he left the warm \\nblanket and pelts. It seemed cold in the fireless cave. The noise of the \\nwater was loud in the stillness. He put on his cloak and followed Faramir. \\n\\nSam, waking suddenly by some instinct of watchfulness, saw first his \\nmaster\\'s empty bed and leapt to his feet. Then he saw two dark figures, \\nFrodo and a man, framed against the archway, which was now filled with \\npale white light. He hurried after them, past rows of men sleeping on \\nmattresses along the wall. As he went by the cave-mouth he saw that the \\nCurtain was now become a dazzling veil of silk and pearls and silver thread: \\nmelting icicles of moonlight. But he did not pause to admire it, and turning \\naside he followed his master through the narrow doorway in the wall of the \\ncave. \\n\\nThey went first along a black passage, then up many wet steps, and so \\ncame to a small flat landing cut in the stone and lit by the pale sky, \\ngleaming high above through a long deep shaft. From here two flights of \\nsteps led: one going on, as it seemed, up on to the high bank of the stream; \\nthe other turning away to the left. This they followed. It wound its way up \\nlike a turret- stair. \\n\\nAt last they came out of the stony darkness and looked about. They were \\non a wide flat rock without rail or parapet. At their right, eastwards, the \\ntorrent fell, splashing over many terraces, and then, pouring down a steep \\nrace, it filled a smooth-hewn channel with a dark force of water flecked \\nwith foam, and curling and rushing almost at their feet it plunged sheer \\nover the edge that yawned upon their left. A man stood there, near the \\nbrink, silent, gazing down. \\n\\nFrodo turned to watch the sleek necks of the water as they curved and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndived. Then he lifted his eyes and gazed far away. The world was quiet and \\ncold, as if dawn were near. Far off in the West the full moon was sinking, \\nround and white. Pale mists shimmered in the great vale below: a wide gulf \\nof silver fume, beneath which rolled the cool night-waters of the Anduin. A \\nblack darkness loomed beyond, and in it glinted, here and there, cold, \\nsharp, remote, white as the teeth of ghosts, the peaks of Ered Nimrais, the \\nWhite Mountains of the Realm of Gondor, tipped with everlasting snow. \\n\\nFor a while Frodo stood there on the high stone, and a shiver ran \\nthrough him, wondering if anywhere in the vastness of the night -lands his \\nold companions walked or slept, or lay dead shrouded in mist. Why was he \\nbrought here out of forgetful sleep? \\n\\nSam was eager for an answer to the same question and could not refrain \\nhimself from muttering, for his master\\'s ear alone as he thought: \\'It\\'s a \\nfine view, no doubt, Mr. Frodo, but chilly to the heart, not to mention the \\nbones ! What\\'s going on? \\' \\n\\nFaramir heard and answered. \\'Moonset over Gondor. Fair Ithil as he goes \\nfrom Middle-earth, glances upon the white locks of old Mindolluin. It is \\nworth a few shivers. But that is not what I brought you to see-though as for \\nyou, Samwise, you were not brought, and do but pay the penalty of your \\nwatchfulness. A draught of wine shall amend it. Come, look now! \\' \\n\\nFie stepped up beside the silent sentinel on the dark edge, and Frodo \\nfollowed. Sam hung back. He already felt insecure enough on this high wet \\nplatform. Faramir and Frodo looked down. Far below them they saw the white \\nwaters pour into a foaming bowl, and then swirl darkly about a deep oval \\nbasin in the rocks, until they found their way out again through a narrow \\ngate, and flowed away, fuming and chattering, into calmer and more level \\nreaches. The moonlight still slanted down to the fall\\'s foot and gleamed on \\nthe ripples of the basin. Presently Frodo was aware of a small dark thing on \\nthe near bank, but even as he looked at it, it dived and vanished just \\nbeyond the boil and bubble of the fall, cleaving the black water as neatly \\nas an arrow or an edgewise stone. \\n\\nFaramir turned to the man at his side. \\'Now what would you say that it \\nis, Anborn? A squirrel, or a kingfisher? Are there black kingfishers in the \\nnight-pools of Mirkwood? \\' \\n\\nv \\'Tis not a bird, whatever else it be,\\' answered Anborn. \\'It has four \\nlimbs and dives manwise; a pretty mastery of the craft it shows, too. What \\nis it at? Seeking a way up behind the Curtain to our hidings? It seems we \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nare discovered at last. I have my bow here, and I have posted other archers, \\nnigh as good marksmen as myself, on either bank. We wait only for your \\ncommand to shoot, Captain.\\' \\n\\n\\'Shall we shoot? \\' said Faramir, turning quickly to Frodo. \\n\\nFrodo did not answer for a moment. Then \\'No! \\' he said. \\'No! I beg you \\nnot to.\\' If Sam had dared, he would have said \\'Yes,\\' quicker and louder. He \\ncould not see, but he guessed well enough from their words what they were \\nlooking at. \\n\\n\\'You know, then, what this thing is? \\' said Faramir. \\'Come, now you \\nhave seen, tell me why it should be spared. In all our words together you \\nhave not once spoken of your gangrel companion, and I let him be for the \\ntime. He could wait till he was caught and brought before me. I sent my \\nkeenest huntsmen to seek him, but he slipped them, and they had no sight of \\nhim till now, save Anborn here, once at dusk y esterevening. But now he has \\ndone worse trespass than only to go coney-snaring in the uplands: he has \\ndared to come to Henneth Annyn, and his life is forfeit. I marvel at the \\ncreature: so secret and so sly as he is, to come sporting in the pool before \\nour very window. Does he think that men sleep without watch all night? Why \\ndoes he so?\\' \\n\\n\\'There are two answers, I think,\\' said Frodo. \\'For one thing, he knows \\nlittle of Men, and sly though he is, your refuge is so hidden that perhaps \\nhe does not know that Men are concealed here. For another, I think he is \\nallured here by a mastering desire, stronger than his caution.\\' \\n\\n\\'He is lured here, you say? \\' said Faramir in a low voice. \\'Can he, \\ndoes he then know of your burden? \\' \\n\\n\\'Indeed yes. He bore it himself for many years.\\' \\n\\n\\'He bore it? \\' said Faramir, breathing sharply in his wonder. \\'This \\nmatter winds itself ever in new riddles. Then he is pursuing it? \\' \\n\\n\\'Maybe. It is precious to him. But I did not speak of that.\\' \\n\\n\\'What then does the creature seek? \\' \\n\\n\\'Fish,\\' said Frodo. \\'Look! \\' \\n\\nThey peered down at the dark pool. A little black head appeared at the \\nfar end of the basin, just out of the deep shadow of the rocks. There was a \\nbrief silver glint, and a swirl of tiny ripples. It swam to the side, and \\nthen with marvellous agility a froglike figure climbed out of the water and \\nup the bank. At once it sat down and began to gnaw at the small silver thing \\nthat glittered as it turned: the last rays of the moon were now falling \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbehind the stony wall at the pool\\'s end. \\n\\nFaramir laughed softly. \\'Fish! \\' he said. \\'It is a less perilous \\nhunger. Or maybe not: fish from the pool of Henneth Annyn may cost him all \\nhe has to give.\\' \\n\\n\\'Now I have him at the arrow-point,\\' said Anborn. \\'Shall I not shoot, \\nCaptain? For coming unbidden to this place death is our law.\\' \\n\\n\\'Wait, Anborn,\\' said Faramir. \\'This is a harder matter than it seems. \\n\\nWhat have you to say now, Frodo? Why should we spare? \\' \\n\\n\\'The creature is wretched and hungry,\\' said Frodo, \\'and unaware of his \\ndanger. And Gandalf, your Mithrandir, he would have bidden you not to slay \\nhim for that reason, and for others. He forbade the Elves to do so. I do not \\nknow clearly why, and of what I guess I cannot speak openly out here. But \\nthis creature is in some way bound up with my errand. Until you found us and \\ntook us, he was my guide.\\' \\n\\n\\'Your guide! \\' said Faramir. \\'The matter becomes ever stranger. I would \\ndo much for you, Frodo, but this I cannot grant: to let this sly wanderer go \\nfree at his own will from here, to join you later if it please him, or to be \\ncaught by Ores and tell all he knows under threat of pain. He must be slain \\nor taken. Slain, if he be not taken very swiftly. But how can this slippery \\nthing of many guises be caught, save by a feathered shaft? \\' \\n\\n\\'Let me go down quietly to him,\\' said Frodo. \\'You may keep your bows \\nbent, and shoot me at least, if I fail. I shall not run away.\\' \\n\\n\\'Go then and be swift! \\' said Faramir. \\'If he comes off alive, he \\nshould be your faithful servant for the rest of his unhappy days. Lead Frodo \\ndown to the bank, Anborn, and go softly. The thing has a nose and ears. Give \\nme your bow.\\' \\n\\nAnborn grunted and led the way down the winding stair to the landing, \\nand then up the other stair, until at last they came to a narrow opening \\nshrouded with thick bushes. Passing silently through, Frodo found himself on \\nthe top of the southern bank above the pool. It was now dark and the falls \\nwere pale and grey, reflecting only the lingering moonlight of the western \\nsky. He could not see Gollum. He went forward a short way and Anborn \\ncame \\n\\nsoftly behind him. \\n\\n\\'Goon! \\' he breathed in Frodo\\'s ear. \\'Have a care to your right. If \\nyou fall in the pool, then no one but your fishing friend can help you. And \\nforget not that there are bowmen near at hand, though you may not see them.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrodo crept forward, using his hands Gollum-like to feel his way and to \\nsteady himself. The rocks were for the most part flat and smooth but \\nslippery. He halted listening. At first he could hear no sound but the \\nunceasing rush of the fall behind him. Then presently he heard, not far \\nahead, a hissing murmur. \\n\\n\\'Fissh, nice fissh. White Face has vanished, my precious, at last, yes. \\n\\nNow we can eat fish in peace. No, not in peace, precious. For Precious is \\nlost; yes, lost. Dirty hobbits, nasty hobbits. Gone and left us, gollum; and \\nPrecious is gone. Only poor Smjagol all alone. No Precious. Nasty Men, \\nthey\\'ll take it, steal my Precious. Thieves. We hates them. Fissh, nice \\nfissh: Makes us strong. Makes eyes bright, fingers tight, yes. Throttle \\nthem, precious. Throttle them all, yes, if we gets chances. Nice fissh. Nice \\nfissh! \\' \\n\\nSo it went on, almost as unceasing as the waterfall, only interrupted \\nby a faint noise of slavering and gurgling. Frodo shivered, listening with \\npity and disgust. He wished it would stop, and that he never need hear that \\nvoice again. Anborn was not far behind. He could creep back and ask him to \\nget the huntsmen to shoot. They would probably get close enough, while \\nGollum was gorging and off his guard. Only one true shot, and Frodo would be \\nrid of the miserable voice for ever. But no, Gollum had a claim on him now. \\nThe servant has a claim on the master for service, even service in fear. \\n\\nThey would have foundered in the Dead Marshes but for Gollum. Frodo \\nknew, \\n\\ntoo, somehow, quite clearly that Gandalf would not have wished it. \\n\\n\\'Smjagol! \\' he said softly. \\n\\n\\'Fissh, nice fissh,\\' said the voice. \\n\\n\\'Smjagol! \\' he said, a little louder. The voice stopped. \\n\\n\\'Smjagol, Master has come to look for you. Master is here. Come, \\nSmjagol! \\' There was no answer but a soft hiss, as of intaken breath. \\n\\n\\'Come, Smjagol! \\' said Frodo. \\'We are in danger. Men will kill you, if \\nthey find you here. Come quickly, if you wish to escape death. Come to \\nMaster!\\' \\n\\n\\'No!\\' said the voice. \\'Not nice Master. Leaves poor Smjagol and goes \\nwith new friends. Master can wait. Smjagol hasn\\'t finished.\\' \\n\\n\\'There\\'s no time,\\' said Frodo. \\'Bring fish with you. Come! \\' \\n\\n\\'No! Must finish fish.\\' \\n\\n\\'Smjagol! \\' said Frodo desperately. \\'Precious will be angry. I shall \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntake Precious, and I shall say: make him swallow the bones and choke. Never \\ntaste fish again. Come, Precious is waiting! \\' \\n\\nThere was a sharp hiss. Presently out of the darkness Gollum came \\ncrawling on all fours, like an erring dog called to heel. He had a \\nhalf-eaten fish in his mouth and another in his hand. He came close to \\nFrodo, almost nose to nose, and sniffed at him. His pale eyes were shining. \\nThen he took the fish out of his mouth and stood up. \\n\\n\\'Nice Master! \\' he whispered. \\'Nice hobbit, come back to poor Smjagol. \\nGood Smjagol comes. Now let\\'s go, go quickly, yes. Through the trees, while \\nthe Faces are dark. Yes, come let\\'s go! \\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, we\\'ll go soon,\\' said Frodo. \\'But not at once. I will go with you \\nas I promised. I promise again. But not now. You are not safe yet. I will \\nsave you, but you must trust me.\\' \\n\\n\\'We must trust Master? \\' said Gollum doubtfully. \\'Why? Why not go at \\nonce? Where is the other one, the cross rude hobbit? Where is he?\\' \\n\\n\\'Away up there,\\' said Frodo, pointing to the waterfall. \\'I am not going \\nwithout him. We must go back to him.\\' His heart sank. This was too much like \\ntrickery. He did not really fear that Faramir would allow Gollum to be \\nkilled, but he would probably make him prisoner and bind him; and certainly \\nwhat Frodo did would seem a treachery to the poor treacherous creature. It \\nwould probably be impossible ever to make him understand or believe that \\nFrodo had saved his life in the only way he could. What else could he do? -- \\nto keep faith, as near as might be, with both sides. \\'Come!\\' he said. \\'Or \\nthe Precious will be angry. We are going back now, up the stream. Go on, go \\non, you go in front! \\' \\n\\nGollum crawled along close to the brink for a little way, snuffling and \\nsuspicious. Presently he stopped and raised his head. \\'Something\\'s there! \\' \\nhe said. \\'Not a hobbit.\\' Suddenly he turned back. A green light was \\nflickering in his bulging eyes. \\'Masster, masster!\\' he hissed. \\'Wicked! \\nTricksy! False!\\' He spat and stretched out his long arms with white snapping \\nfingers. \\n\\nAt that moment the great black shape of Anborn loomed up behind him and \\ncame down on him. A large strong hand took him in the nape of the neck and \\npinned him. He twisted round like lightning, all wet and slimy as he was, \\nwriggling like an eel, biting and scratching like a cat. But two more men \\ncame up out of the shadows. \\n\\n\\'Hold still! \\' said one. \\'Or we\\'ll stick you as full of pins as a \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhedgehog. Hold still!\\' \\n\\nGollum went limp, and began to whine and weep. They tied him, none too \\ngently. \\n\\n\\'Easy, easy! \\' said Frodo. \\'He has no strength to match you. Don\\'t hurt \\nhim, if you can help it. He\\'ll be quieter, if you don\\'t. Smjagol! They won\\'t \\nhurt you. I\\'ll go with you, and you shall come to no harm. Not unless they \\nkill me too. Trust Master! \\' \\n\\nGollum turned and spat at him. The men picked him up, put a hood over \\nhis eyes, and carried him off. \\n\\nFrodo followed them, feeling very wretched. They went through the \\nopening behind the bushes, and back, down the stairs and passages, into the \\ncave. Two or three torches had been lit. Men were stirring. Sam was there, \\nand he gave a queer look at the limp bundle that the men carried. \\'Got him?\\' \\nhe said to Frodo. \\n\\n\\'Yes. Well no, I didn\\'t get him. He came to me, because he trusted me \\nat first, I\\'m afraid. I did not want him tied up like this. I hope it will \\nbe all right; but I hate the whole business.\\' \\n\\n\\'So do I,\\' said Sam. \\'And nothing will ever be all right where that \\npiece of misery is.\\' \\n\\nA man came and beckoned to the hobbits, and took them to the recess at \\nthe back of the cave. Faramir was sitting there in his chair, and the lamp \\nhad been rekindled in its niche above his head. He signed to them to sit \\ndown on the stools beside him. \\'Bring wine for the guests,\\' he said. \\'And \\nbring the prisoner to me.\\' \\n\\nThe wine was brought, and then Anborn came carrying Gollum. He \\nremoved \\n\\nthe cover from Gollum\\'s head and set him on his feet standing behind him to \\nsupport him. Gollum blinked, hooding the malice of his eyes with their heavy \\npale lids. A very miserable creature he looked, dripping and dank, smelling \\nof fish (he still clutched one in his hand); his sparse locks were hanging \\nlike rank weed over his bony brows, his nose was snivelling. \\n\\n\\'Foose us! Foose us! \\' he said. \\'The cord hurts us, yes it does, it \\nhurts us, and we\\'ve done nothing.\\' \\n\\n\\'Nothing? \\' said Faramir, looking at the wretched creature with a keen \\nglance, but without any expression in his face either of anger, or pity, or \\nwonder. \\'Nothing? Have you never done anything worthy of binding or of \\n\\n\\n\\nworse \\n\\n\\n\\n\\npunishment? However, that is not for me to judge, happily. But tonight you \\nhave come where it is death to come. The fish of this pool are dearly \\nbought.\\' \\n\\nGollum dropped the fish from his hand. \\'Don\\'t want fish,\\' he said. \\n\\n\\'The price is not set on the fish,\\' said Faramir. \\'Only to come here \\nand look on the pool bears the penalty of death. I have spared you so far at \\nthe prayer of Frodo here, who says that of him at least you have deserved \\nsome thanks. But you must also satisfy me. What is your name? Whence do \\nyou \\n\\ncome? And whither do you go? What is your business? \\' \\n\\n\\'We are lost, lost,\\' said Gollum. \\'No name, no business, no Precious, \\nnothing. Only empty. Only hungry; yes, we are hungry. A few little fishes, \\nnasty bony little fishes, for a poor creature, and they say death. So wise \\nthey are; so just, so very just.\\' \\n\\n\\'Not very wise,\\' said Faramir. \\'But just: yes perhaps, as just as our \\nlittle wisdom allows. Unloose him Frodo! \\' Faramir took a small nail -knife \\nfrom his belt and handed it to Frodo. Gollum misunderstanding the gesture, \\nsquealed and fell down. \\n\\n\\'Now, Smjagol! \\' said Frodo. \\'You must trust me. I will not desert you. \\nAnswer truthfully, if you can. It will do you good not harm.\\' He cut the \\ncords on Gollum\\'s wrists and ankles and raised him to his feet. \\n\\n\\'Come hither! \\' said Faramir. \\'Look at me! Do you know the name of this \\nplace? Have you been here before? \\' \\n\\nSlowly Gollum raised his eyes and looked unwillingly into Faramir\\'s. \\n\\nAll light went out of them, and they stared bleak and pale for a moment into \\nthe clear unwavering eyes of the man of Gondor. There was a still silence. \\nThen Gollum dropped his head and shrank down, until he was squatting on the \\nfloor, shivering. \\'We doesn\\'t know and we doesn\\'t want to know,\\' he \\nwhimpered. \\'Never came here; never come again.\\' \\n\\n\\'There are locked doors and closed windows in your mind, and dark rooms \\nbehind them,\\' said Faramir. \\'But in this I judge that you speak the truth. \\n\\nIt is well for you. What oath will you swear never to return; and never to \\nlead any living creature hither by word or sign?\\' \\n\\n\\'Master knows,\\' said Gollum with a sidelong glance at Frodo. \\'Yes, he \\nknows. We will promise Master, if he saves us. We\\'ll promise to It, yes.\\' He \\ncrawled to Frodo\\'s feet. \\'Save us, nice Master! \\' he whined. \\'Smjagol \\npromises to Precious, promises faithfully. Never come again, never speak, no \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnever! No, precious, no!\\' \\n\\n\\'Are you satisfied? \\' said Faramir. \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Frodo. \\'At least, you must either accept this promise or \\ncarry out your law. You will get no more. But I promised that if he came to \\nme, he should not be harmed. And I would not be proved faithless.\\' \\n\\nFaramir sat for a moment in thought. \\'Very good,\\' he said at last. \\'I \\nsurrender you to your master, to Frodo son of Drogo. Let him declare what he \\nwill do with you ! \\' \\n\\n\\'But, Lord Faramir,\\' said Frodo bowing, \\'you have not yet declared your \\nwill concerning the said Frodo, and until that is made known, he cannot \\nshape his plans for himself or his companions. Your judgement was postponed \\nuntil the morning; but that is now at hand.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then I will declare my doom,\\' said Faramir. \\'As for you, Frodo, in so \\nfar as lies in me under higher authority, I declare you free in the realm \\nof, Gondor to the furthest of its ancient bounds; save only that neither you \\nnor any that go with you have leave to come to this place unbidden. This \\ndoom shall stand for a year and a day, and then cease, unless you shall \\nbefore that term come to Minas Tirith and present yourself to the Lord and \\nSteward of the City. Then I will entreat him to confirm what I have done and \\nto make it lifelong. In the meantime, whomsoever you take under your \\nprotection shall be under my protection and under the shield of Gondor. Are \\nyou answered? \\' \\n\\nFrodo bowed low. \\'I am answered,\\' he said, \\'and I place myself at your \\nservice, if that is of any worth to one so high and honourable.\\' \\n\\n\\'It is of great worth,\\' said Faramir. \\'And now, do you take this \\ncreature, this Smjagol, under your protection? \\' \\n\\n\\'I do take Smjagol under my protection,\\' said Frodo. Sam sighed \\naudibly; and not at the courtesies, of which, as any hobbit would, he \\nthoroughly approved. Indeed in the Shire such a matter would have required a \\ngreat many more words and bows. \\n\\n\\'Then I say to you,\\' said Faramir, turning to Gollum, \\'you are under \\ndoom of death; but while you walk with Frodo you are safe for our part. Yet \\nif ever you be found by any man of Gondor astray without him, the doom shall \\nfall. And may death find you swiftly, within Gondor or without, if you do \\nnot well serve him. Now answer me: whither would you go? You were his \\nguide, \\n\\nhe says. Whither were you leading him? \\' Gollum made no reply. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'This I will not have secret,\\' said Faramir. \\'Answer me, or I will \\nreverse my judgement! \\' Still Gollum did not answer. \\n\\n\\'I will answer for him,\\' said Frodo. \\'He brought me to the Black Gate, \\nas I asked; but it was impassable.\\' \\n\\n\\'There is no open gate into the Nameless Land,\\' said Faramir. \\n\\n\\'Seeing this, we turned aside and came by the Southward road \\' Frodo \\ncontinued; \\'for he said that there is, or there may be, a path near to Minas \\nIthil . \\' \\n\\n\\'Minas Morgul,\\' said Faramir. \\n\\n\\'I do not know clearly,\\' said Frodo; \\'but the path climbs, I think, up \\ninto the mountains on the northern side of that vale where the old city \\nstands. It goes up to a high cleft and so down to -- that which is beyond.\\' \\n\\n\\'Do you know the name of that high pass? \\' said Faramir. \\n\\n\\'No,\\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'It is called Cirith Ungol.\\' Gollum hissed sharply and began muttering \\nto himself. \\'Is not that its name? \\' said Faramir turning to him. \\n\\n\\'No! \\' said Gollum, and then he squealed, as if something had stabbed \\nhim. \\'Yes, yes, we heard the name once. But what does the name matter to us? \\nMaster says he must get in. So we must try some way. There is no other way \\nto try, no.\\' \\n\\n\\'No other way? \\'said Faramir. \\'How do you know that? And who has \\nexplored all the confines of that dark realm? \\' He looked long and \\nthoughtfully at Gollum. Presently he spoke again. \\'Take this creature away, \\nAnborn. Treat him gently, but watch him. And do not you, Smjagol, try to \\ndive into the falls. The rocks have such teeth there as would slay you \\nbefore your time. Leave us now and take your fish! \\' \\n\\nAnborn went out and Gollum went cringing before him. The curtain was \\ndrawn across the recess. \\n\\n\\'Frodo, I think you do very unwisely in this,\\' said Faramir. \\'I do not \\nthink you should go with this creature. It is wicked.\\' \\n\\n\\'No, not altogether wicked,\\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'Not wholly, perhaps,\\' said Faramir; \\'but malice eats it like a canker, \\nand the evil is growing. He will lead you to no good. If you will part with \\nhim, I will give him safe-conduct and guidance to any point on the borders \\nof Gondor that he may name.\\' \\n\\n\\'He would not take it,\\' said Frodo. \\'He would follow after me as he \\nlong has done. And I have promised many times to take him under my \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nprotection and to go where he led. You would not ask me to break faith with \\nhim?\\' \\n\\n\\'No,\\' said Faramir. \\'But my heart would. For it seems less evil to \\ncounsel another man to break troth than to do so oneself, especially if one \\nsees a friend bound unwitting to his own harm. But no -- if he will go with \\nyou, you must now endure him. But I do not think you are holden to go to \\nCirith Ungol, of which he has told you less than he knows. That much I \\nperceived clearly in his mind. Do not go to Cirith Ungol!\\' \\n\\n\\'Where then shall I go? \\' said Frodo. \\'Back to the Black Gate and \\ndeliver myself up to the guard? What do you know against this place that \\nmakes its name so dreadful? \\' \\n\\n\\'Nothing certain,\\' said Faramir. \\'We of Gondor do not ever pass east of \\nthe Road in these days, and none of us younger men has ever done so, nor has \\nany of us set foot upon the Mountains of Shadow. Of them we know only old \\nreport and the rumour of bygone days. But there is some dark terror that \\ndwells in the passes above Minas Morgul. If Cirith Ungol is named, old men \\nand masters of lore will blanch and fall silent. \\n\\n,The valley of Minas Morgul passed into evil very long ago, and it was \\na menace and a dread while the banished Enemy dwelt yet far away, and \\nIthilien was still for the most part in our keeping. As you know, that city \\nwas once a strong place, proud and fair, Minas Ithil, the twin sister of our \\nown city. But it was taken by fell men whom the Enemy in his first strength \\nhad dominated, and who wandered homeless and masterless after his fall. It \\nis said that their lords were men of N(r)menor who had fallen into dark \\nwickedness; to them the Enemy had given rings of power, and he had \\ndevoured \\n\\nthem: living ghosts they were become, terrible and evil. After his going \\nthey took Minas Ithil and dwelt there, and they filled it, and all the \\nvalley about, with decay: it seemed empty and was not so, for a shapeless \\nfear lived within the ruined walls. Nine Lords there were, and after the \\nreturn of their Master, which they aided and prepared in secret, they grew \\nstrong again. Then the Nine Riders issued forth from the gates of horror, \\nand we could not withstand them. Do not approach their citadel. You will be \\nespied. It is a place of sleepless malice, full of lidless eyes. Do not go \\nthat way! \\' \\n\\n\\'But where else will you direct me? \\' said Frodo. \\'You cannot yourself, \\nyou say, guide me to the mountains, nor over them. But over the mountains I \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nam bound, by solemn undertaking to the Council, to find a way or perish in \\nthe seeking. And if I turn back, refusing the road in its bitter end, where \\nthen shall I go among Elves or Men? Would you have me come to Gondor \\nwith \\n\\nthis Thing, the Thing that drove your brother mad with desire? What spell \\nwould it work in Minas Tirith? Shall there be two cities of Minas Morgul, \\ngrinning at each other across a dead land filled with rottenness? \\' \\n\\n\\'I would not have it so,\\' said Faramir. \\n\\n\\'Then what would you have me do? \\' \\n\\n\\'I know not. Only I would not have you go to death or to torment. And I \\ndo not think that Mithrandir would have chosen this way.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yet since he is gone, I must take such paths as I can find. And there \\nis no time for long searching,\\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'It is a hard doom and a hopeless errand,\\' said Faramir. \\'But at the \\nleast, remember my warning: beware of this guide, Smjagol. He has done \\nmurder before now. I read it in him.\\' He sighed. \\n\\n\\'Well, so we meet and part, Frodo son of Drogo. You have no need of \\nsoft words: I do not hope to see you again on any other day under this Sun. \\nBut you shall go now with my blessing upon you, and upon all your people. \\nRest a little while food is prepared for you. \\n\\n\\'I would gladly learn how this creeping Smjagol became possessed of the \\nThing of which we speak, and how he lost it, but I will not trouble you now. \\nIf ever beyond hope you return to the lands of the living and we retell our \\ntales, sitting by a wall in the sun, laughing at old grief, you shall tell \\nme then. Until that time, or some other time beyond the vision of the \\nSeeing-stones of N(r)menor, farewell! \\' \\n\\nHe rose and bowed low to Frodo, and drawing the curtain passed out into \\nthe cave. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 7. Journey to the Cross-roads \\n\\n\\n\\nFrodo and Sam returned to their beds and lay there in silence resting \\nfor a little, while men bestirred themselves and the business of the day \\nbegan. After a while water was brought to them, and then they were led to a \\ntable where food was set for three. Faramir broke his fast with them. He had \\nnot slept since the battle on the day before, yet he did not look weary. \\n\\nWhen they had finished they stood up. \\'May no hunger trouble you on the \\nroad,\\' said Faramir. \\'You have little provision, but some small store of \\nfood fit for travellers I have ordered to be stowed in your packs. You will \\nhave no lack of water as you walk in Ithilien, but do not drink of any \\nstream that flows from Imlad Morgul, the Valley of Living Death. This also I \\nmust tell you. My scouts and watchers have all returned, even some that have \\ncrept within sight of the Morannon. They all find a strange thing. The land \\nis empty. Nothing is on the road, and no sound of foot, or horn, or \\nbowstring is anywhere to be heard. A waiting silence broods above the \\nNameless Land. I do not know what this portends. But the time draws swiftly \\nto some great conclusion. Storm is coming. Hasten while you may! If you are \\nready, let us go. The Sun will soon rise above the shadow.\\' \\n\\nThe hobbits\\' packs were brought to them (a little heavier than they had \\nbeen), and also two stout staves of polished wood, shod with iron, and with \\ncarven heads through which ran plaited leathern thongs. \\n\\n\\'I have no fitting gifts to give you at our parting,\\' said Faramir; \\n\\n\\'but take these staves. They may be of service to those who walk or climb in \\nthe wild. The men of the White Mountains use them; though these have been \\ncut down to your height and newly shod. They are made of the fair tree \\nlebethron, beloved of the woodwrights of Gondor, and a virtue has been set \\nupon them of finding and returning. May that virtue not wholly fail under \\nthe Shadow into which you go!\\' \\n\\nThe hobbits bowed low. \\'Most gracious host,\\' said Frodo, \\'it was said \\nto me by Elrond Halfelven that I should find friendship upon the way, secret \\nand unlooked for. Certainly I looked for no such friendship as you have \\nshown. To have found it turns evil to great good.\\' \\n\\nNow they made ready to depart. Gollum was brought out of some corner or \\nhiding-hole, and he seemed better pleased with himself than he had been, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthough he kept close to Frodo and avoided the glance of Faramir. \\n\\n\\'Your guide must be blindfolded,\\' said Faramir, \\'but you and your \\nservant Samwise I release from this, if you wish.\\' \\n\\nGollum squealed, and squirmed, and clutched at Frodo, when they came to \\nbind his eyes; and Frodo said: \\'Blindfold us all three, and cover up my eyes \\nfirst, and then perhaps he will see that no harm is meant.\\' This was done, \\nand they were led from the cave of Henneth Annyn. After they had passed the \\npassages and stairs they felt the cool morning air, fresh and sweet, about \\nthem. Still blind they went on for some little time, up and then gently \\ndown. At last the voice of Faramir ordered them to be uncovered. \\n\\nThey stood under the boughs of the woods again. No noise of the falls \\ncould be heard, for a long southward slope lay now between them and the \\nravine in which the stream flowed. To the west they could see light through \\nthe trees, as if the world came there to a sudden end, at a brink looking \\nout only on to sky. \\n\\n\\'Here is the last parting of our ways,\\' said Faramir. \\'If you take my \\ncounsel, you will not turn eastward yet. Go straight on, for thus you will \\nhave the cover of the woodland for many miles. On your west is an edge where \\nthe land falls into the great vales, sometimes suddenly and sheer, sometimes \\nin long hillsides. Keep near to this edge and the skirts of the forest. In \\nthe beginning of your journey you may walk under daylight, I think. The land \\ndreams in a false peace, and for a while all evil is withdrawn. Fare you \\nwell, while you may!\\' \\n\\nHe embraced the hobbits then, after the manner of his people, stooping, \\nand placing his hands upon their shoulders, and kissing their foreheads. \\'Go \\nwith the good will of all good men!\\' he said. \\n\\nThey bowed to the ground. Then he turned and without looking back he \\nleft them and went to his two guards that stood at a little distance away. \\n\\nThey marvelled to see with what speed these green -clad men now moved, \\nvanishing almost in the twinkling of an eye. The forest where Faramir had \\nstood seemed empty and drear, as if a dream had passed. \\n\\nFrodo sighed and turned back southward. As if to mark his disregard of \\nall such courtesy, Gollum was scrabbling in the mould at the foot of a tree. \\n\\'Hungry again already?\\' thought Sam. \\'Well, now for it again!\\' \\n\\n\\'Have they gone at last? \\' said Gollum. \\'Nassty wicked Men! Smjagol\\'s \\nneck still hurts him, yes it does. Let\\'s go! \\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, let us go,\\' said Frodo. \\'But if you can only speak ill of those \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwho showed you mercy, keep silent! \\' \\n\\n\\'Nice Master! \\' said Gollum. \\'Smjagol was only joking. Always forgives, \\nhe does, yes, yes, even nice Master\\'s little trickses. Oh yes, nice Master, \\nnice Smjagol! \\' \\n\\nFrodo and Sam did not answer. Hoisting their packs and taking their \\nstaves in hand, they passed on into the woods of Ithilien. \\n\\nTwice that day they rested and took a little of the food provided by \\nFaramir: dried fruits and salted meat, enough for many days; and bread \\nenough to last while it was still fresh. Gollum ate nothing. \\n\\nThe sun rose and passed overhead unseen, and began to sink, and the \\nlight through the trees to the west grew golden; and always they walked in \\ncool green shadow, and all about them was silence. The birds seemed all to \\nhave flown away or to have fallen dumb. \\n\\nDarkness came early to the silent woods, and before the fall of night \\nthey halted, weary, for they had walked seven leagues or more from Henneth \\nAnnyn. Frodo lay and slept away the night on the deep mould beneath an \\nancient tree. Sam beside him was more uneasy: he woke many times, but there \\nwas never a sign of Gollum, who had slipped off as soon as the others had \\nsettled to rest. Whether he had slept by himself in some hole nearby, or had \\nwandered restlessly prowling through the night, he did not say; but he \\nreturned with the first glimmer of light, and roused his companions. \\n\\n\\'Must get up, yes they must!\\' he said. \\'Long ways to go still, south \\nand east. Hobbits must make haste!\\' \\n\\nThat day passed much as the day before had gone, except that the \\nsilence seemed deeper; the air grew heavy, and it began to be stifling under \\nthe trees. It felt as if thunder was brewing. Gollum often paused, sniffing \\nthe air, and then he would mutter to himself and urge them to greater speed. \\n\\nAs the third stage of their day\\'s march drew on and afternoon waned, \\nthe forest opened out, and the trees became larger and more scattered. Great \\nilexes of huge girth stood dark and solemn in wide glades with here and \\nthere among them hoary ash-trees, and giant oaks just putting out their \\nbrown-green buds. About them lay long launds of green grass dappled with \\ncelandine and anemones, white and blue, now folded for sleep; and there were \\nacres populous with the leaves of woodland hyacinths: already their sleek \\nbell-stems were thrusting through the mould. No living creature, beast or \\nbird, was to be seen, but in these open places Gollum grew afraid, and they \\nwalked now with caution, flitting from one long shadow to another. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLight was fading fast when they came to the forest-end. There they sat \\nunder an old gnarled oak that sent its roots twisting like snakes down a \\nsteep crumbling bank. A deep dim valley lay before them. On its further side \\nthe woods gathered again, blue and grey under the sullen evening, and \\nmarched on southwards. To the right the Mountains of Gondor glowed, \\nremote \\n\\nin the West, under a fire-flecked sky. To the left lay darkness: the \\ntowering walls of Mordor; and out of that darkness the long valley came, \\nfalling steeply in an ever-widening trough towards the Anduin. At its bottom \\nran a hurrying stream: Frodo could hear its stony voice coming up through \\nthe silence; and beside it on the hither side a road went winding down like \\na pale ribbon, down into chill grey mists that no gleam of sunset touched. \\nThere it seemed to Frodo that he descried far off, floating as it were on a \\nshadowy sea, the high dim tops and broken pinnacles of old towers forlorn \\nand dark. \\n\\nFie turned to Gollum. \\'Do you know where we are? \\' he said. \\n\\n\\'Yes, Master. Dangerous places. This is the road from the Tower of the \\nMoon, Master, down to the ruined city by the shores of the River. The ruined \\ncity, yes, very nasty place, full of enemies. We shouldn\\'t have taken Men\\'s \\nadvice. Hobbits have come a long way out of the path. Must go east now, away \\nup there.\\' He waved his skinny arm towards the darkling mountains. \\'And we \\ncan\\'t use this road. Oh no! Cruel peoples come this way, down from the \\nTower.\\' \\n\\nFrodo looked down on to the road. At any rate nothing was moving on it \\nnow. It appeared lonely and forsaken, running down to empty ruins in the \\nmist. But there was an evil feeling in the air, as if things might indeed be \\npassing up and down that eyes could not see. Frodo shuddered as he looked \\nagain at the distant pinnacles now dwindling into night, and the sound of \\nthe water seemed cold and cruel: the voice of Morgulduin, the polluted \\nstream that flowed from the Valley of the Wraiths. \\n\\n\\'What shall we do? \\' he said. \\'We have walked long and far. Shall we \\nlook for some place in the woods behind where we can lie hidden? \\' \\n\\n\\'No good hiding in the dark,\\' said Gollum. \\'It\\'s in day that hobbits \\nmust hide now, yes in day.\\' \\n\\n\\'Oh come! \\' said Sam. \\'We must rest for a bit, even if we get up again \\nin the middle of the night. There\\'ll still be hours of dark then time enough \\nfor you to take us a long march, if you know the way.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGollum reluctantly agreed to this, and he turned back towards the \\ntrees, working eastward for a while along the straggling edges of the wood. \\n\\nHe would not rest on the ground so near the evil road, and after some debate \\nthey all climbed up into the crotch of a large holm-oak, whose thick \\nbranches springing together from the trunk made a good hiding-place and a \\nfairly comfortable refuge. Night fell and it grew altogether dark under the \\ncanopy of the tree. Frodo and Sam drank a little water and ate some bread \\nand dried fruit, but Gollum at once curled up and went to sleep. The hobbits \\ndid not shut their eyes. \\n\\nIt must have been a little after midnight when Gollum woke up: suddenly \\nthey were aware of his pale eyes unlidded gleaming at them. He listened and \\nsniffed, which seemed, as they had noticed before, his usual method of \\ndiscovering the time of night. \\n\\n\\'Are we rested? Have we had beautiful sleep?\\' he said. \\'Let\\'s go!\\' \\n\\n\\'We aren\\'t, and we haven\\'t,\\' growled Sam. \\'But we\\'ll go if we must.\\' \\n\\nGollum dropped at once from the branches of the tree on to all fours, \\nand the hobbits followed more slowly. \\n\\nAs soon as they were down they went on again with Gollum leading, \\neastwards, up the dark sloping land. They could see little, for the night \\nwas now so deep that they were hardly aware of the stems of trees before \\nthey stumbled against them. The ground became more broken and walking \\nwas \\n\\nmore difficult, but Gollum seemed in no way troubled. He led them through \\nthickets and wastes of brambles; sometimes round the lip of a deep cleft or \\ndark pit, sometimes down into black bush-shrouded hollows and out again; but \\nif ever they went a little downward, always the further slope was longer and \\nsteeper. They were climbing steadily. At their first halt they looked back, \\nand they could dimly perceive the roofs of the forest they had left behind \\nlying like a vast dense shadow, a darker night under the dark blank sky. \\nThere seemed to be a great blackness looming slowly out of the East, eating \\nup the faint blurred stars. Later the sinking moon escaped from the pursuing \\ncloud, but it was ringed all about with a sickly yellow glare. \\n\\nAt last Gollum turned to the hobbits. \\'Day soon,\\' he said. \\'Hobbits \\nmust hurry. Not safe to stay in the open in these places. Make haste! \\' \\n\\nHe quickened his pace, and they followed him wearily. Soon they began \\nto climb up on to a great hog-back of land. For the most part it was covered \\nwith a thick growth of gorse and whortleberry, and low tough thorns, though \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhere and there clearings opened, the scars of recent fires. The gorse-bushes \\nbecame more frequent as they got nearer the top; very old and tall they \\nwere, gaunt and leggy below but thick above, and already putting out yellow \\nflowers that glimmered in the gloom and gave a faint sweet scent. So tall \\nwere the spiny thickets that the hobbits could walk upright under them, \\npassing through long dry aisles carpeted with a deep prickly mould. \\n\\nOn the further edge of this broad hill-back they stayed their march and \\ncrawled for hiding underneath a tangled knot of thorns. Their twisted \\nboughs, stooping to the ground, were overridden by a clambering maze of old \\nbriars. Deep inside there was a hollow hall, raftered with dead branch and \\nbramble, and roofed with the first leaves and shoots of spring. There they \\nlay for a while, too tired yet to eat; and peering out through the holes in \\nthe covert they watched for the slow growth of day. \\n\\nBut no day came, only a dead brown twilight. In the East there was a \\ndull red glare under the lowering cloud: it was not the red of dawn. Across \\nthe tumbled lands between, the mountains of the Ephel D(r)ath frowned at \\nthem, \\n\\nblack and shapeless below where night lay thick and did not pass away, above \\nwith jagged tops and edges outlined hard and menacing against the fiery \\nglow. Away to their right a great shoulder of the mountains stood out, dark \\nand black amid the shadows, thrusting westward. \\n\\n\\'Which way do we go from here?\\' asked Frodo. \\'Is that the opening of-of \\nthe Morgul Valley, away over there beyond that black mass?\\' \\n\\n\\'Need we think about it yet?\\' said Sam, \\'Surely we\\'re not going to move \\nany more today, if day it is?\\' \\n\\n\\'Perhaps not, perhaps not,\\' said Gollum. \\'But we must go soon, to the \\nCross-roads. Yes, to the Cross-roads. That\\'s the way over there yes, \\nMaster.\\' \\n\\nThe red glare over Mordor died away. The twilight deepened as great \\nvapours rose in the East and crawled above them. Frodo and Sam took a little \\nfood and then lay down, but Gollum was restless. He would not eat any of \\ntheir food, but he drank a little water and then crawled about under the \\nbushes, sniffing and muttering. Then, suddenly he disappeared. \\n\\n\\'Off hunting, I suppose,\\' said Sam and yawned. It was his turn to sleep \\nfirst, and he was soon deep in a dream. He thought he was back in the Bag \\nEnd garden looking for something; but he had a heavy pack on his back, which \\nmade him stoop. It all seemed very weedy and rank somehow, and thorns and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbracken were invading the beds down near the bottom hedge. \\n\\n\\'A job of work for me, I can see; but I\\'m so tired,\\' he kept on saying. \\nPresently he remembered what he was looking for. \\'My pipe!\\' he said, and \\nwith that he woke up. \\n\\n\\'Silly!\\' he said to himself, as he opened his eyes and wondered why he \\nwas lying down under the hedge. \\'It\\'s in your pack all the time!\\' Then he \\nrealized, first that the pipe might be in his pack but he had no leaf, and \\nnext that he was hundreds of miles from Bag End. He sat up. It seemed to be \\nalmost dark. Why had his master let him sleep on out of turn, right on till \\nevening? \\n\\n\\'Haven\\'t you had no sleep, Mr. Frodo?\\' he said. \\'What\\'s the time? Seems \\nto be getting late!\\' \\n\\n\\'No it isn\\'t,\\' said Frodo. \\'But the day is getting darker instead of \\nlighter: darker and darker. As far as I can tell, it isn\\'t midday yet, and \\nyou\\'ve only slept for about three hours.\\' \\n\\n\\'I wonder what\\'s up,\\' said Sam. \\'Is there a storm coming? If so it\\'s \\ngoing to be the worst there ever was. We shall wish we were down a deep \\nhole, not just stuck under a hedge.\\' He listened. \\'What\\'s that? Thunder, or \\ndrums, or what is it? \\' \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know,\\' said Frodo. \\'It\\'s been going on for a good while now. \\nSometimes the ground seems to tremble, sometimes it seems to be the heavy \\nair throbbing in your ears.\\' \\n\\nSam looked round. \\'Where\\'s Gollum? \\' he said. \\'Hasn\\'t he come back \\nyet?\\' \\n\\n\\'No,\\' said Frodo. \\'There\\'s not been a sign or sound of him.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, I can\\'t abide him,\\' said Sam. \\'In fact, I\\'ve never taken \\nanything on a journey that I\\'d have been less sorry to lose on the way. But \\nit would be just like him, after coming all these miles, to go and get lost \\nnow, just when we shall need him most -- that is, if he\\'s ever going to be \\nany use, which I doubt.\\' \\n\\n\\'You forget the Marshes,\\' said Frodo. I hope nothing has happened to \\nhim.\\' \\n\\n\\'And I hope he\\'s up to no tricks. And anyway I hope he doesn\\'t fall \\ninto other hands, as you might say. Because if he does, we shall soon be in \\nfor trouble.\\' \\n\\nAt that moment a rolling and rumbling noise was heard again, louder now \\nand deeper. The ground seemed to quiver under their feet. \\'I think we are in \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfor trouble anyhow,\\' said Frodo. \\'I\\'m afraid our journey is drawing to an \\nend.\\' \\n\\n\\'Maybe,\\' said Sam; \\'but where there\\'s life there\\'s hope , as my Gaffer \\nused to say; and need of vittles, as he mostway s used to add. You have a \\nbite, Mr. Frodo, and then a bit of sleep.\\' \\n\\nThe afternoon, as Sam supposed it must be called, wore on. Looking out \\nfrom the covert he could see only a dun, shadowless world, fading slowly \\ninto a featureless, colourless gloom. It felt stifling but not warm. Frodo \\nslept unquietly, turning and tossing, and sometimes murmuring. Twice Sam \\nthought he heard him speaking Gandalf s name. The time seemed to drag \\ninterminably. Suddenly Sam heard a hiss behind him, and there was Gollum \\non \\n\\nall fours, peering at them with gleaming eyes. \\n\\n\\'Wake up, wake up! Wake up, sleepies!\\' he whispered. \\'Wake up! No time \\nto lose. We must go, yes, we must go at once. No time to lose!\\' \\n\\nSam stared at him suspiciously: he seemed frightened or excited. \\'Go \\nnow? What\\'s your little game? It isn\\'t time yet. It can\\'t be tea-time even, \\nleastways not in decent places where there is tea-time.\\' \\n\\n\\'Silly! \\' hissed Gollum. \\'We\\'re not in decent places. Time\\'s running \\nshort, yes, running fast. No time to lose. We must go. Wake up. Master, wake \\nu He clawed at Frodo; and Frodo, startled out of sleep, sat up suddenly and \\nseized him by the arm. Gollum tore himself loose and backed away. \\n\\n\\'They mustn\\'t be silly,\\' he hissed. \\'We must go. No time to lose!\\' And \\nnothing more could they get out of him. Where he had been, and what he \\nthought was brewing to make him in such a hurry, he would not say. Sam was \\nfilled with deep suspicion, and showed it; but Frodo gave no sign of what \\nwas passing in his mind. He sighed, hoisted his pack, and prepared to go out \\ninto the ever -gathering darkness. \\n\\nVery stealthily Gollum led them down the hillside, keeping under cover \\nwherever it was possible, and running, almost bent to the ground, across any \\nopen space; but the light was now so dim that even a keen-eyed beast of the \\nwild could scarcely have seen the hobbits, hooded, in their grey cloaks, nor \\nheard them, walking as warily as the little people can. Without the crack of \\na twig or the rustle of a leaf they passed and vanished. \\n\\nFor about an hour they went on, silently, in single file, oppressed by \\nthe gloom and by the absolute stillness of the land, broken only now and \\nagain by the faint rumbling as of thunder far away or drum-beats in some \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhollow of the hills. Down from their hiding-place they went, and then \\nturning south they steered as straight a course as Gollum could find across \\na long broken slope that leaned up towards the mountains. Presently, not far \\nahead, looming up like a black wall, they saw a belt of trees. As they drew \\nnearer they became aware that these were of vast size, very ancient it \\nseemed, and still towering high, though their tops were gaunt and broken, as \\nif tempest and lightning-blast had swept across them, but had failed to kill \\nthem or to shake their fathomless roots. \\n\\nThe Cross-roads, yes,\\' whispered Gollum, the first words that had been \\nspoken since they left their hiding-place. \\'We must go that way.\\' Turning \\neastward now, he led them up the slope; and then suddenly there it was \\nbefore them: the Southward Road, winding its way about the outer feet of the \\nmountains, until presently it plunged into the great ring of trees. \\n\\nThis is the only way,\\' whispered Gollum. \\'No paths beyond the road. No \\npaths. We must go to the Cross-roads. But make haste! Be silent! \\' \\n\\nAs furtively as scouts within the campment of their enemies, they crept \\ndown on to the road, and stole along its westward edge under the stony bank, \\ngrey as the stones themselves, and soft-footed as hunting cats. At length \\nthey reached the trees, and found that they stood in a great roofless ring, \\nopen in the middle to the sombre sky; and the spaces between their immense \\nboles were like the great dark arches of some ruined hall. In the very \\ncentre four ways met. Behind them lay the road to the Morannon; before them \\nit ran out again upon its long journey south; to their right the road from \\nold Osgiliath came climbing up, and crossing, passed out eastward into \\ndarkness: the fourth way, the road they were to take. \\n\\nStanding there for a moment filled with dread Frodo became aware that a \\nlight was shining; he saw it glowing on Sam\\'s face beside him. Turning \\ntowards it, he saw, beyond an arch of boughs, the road to Osgiliath running \\nalmost as straight as a stretched ribbon down, down, into the West. There, \\nfar away, beyond sad Gondor now overwhelmed in shade, the Sun was \\nsinking, \\n\\nfinding at last the hem of the great slow-rolling pall of cloud, and falling \\nin an ominous fire towards the yet unsullied Sea. The brief glow fell upon a \\nhuge sitting figure, still and solemn as the great stone kings of Argonath. \\n\\nThe years had gnawed it, and violent hands had maimed it. Its head was gone, \\nand in its place was set in mockery a round rough-hewn stone, rudely painted \\nby savage hands in the likeness of a grinning face with one large red eye in \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe midst of its forehead. Upon its knees and mighty chair, and all about \\nthe pedestal, were idle scrawls mixed with the foul symbols that the \\nmaggot-folk of Mordor used. \\n\\nSuddenly, caught by the level beams, Frodo saw the old king\\'s head: it \\nwas lying rolled away by the roadside. \\'Look, Sam!\\' he cried, startled into \\nspeech. \\'Look! The king has got a crown again!\\' \\n\\nThe eyes were hollow and the carven beard was broken, but about the \\nhigh stern forehead there was a coronal of silver and gold. A trailing plant \\nwith flowers like small white stars had bound itself across the brows as if \\nin reverence for the fallen king, and in the crevices of his stony hair \\nyellow stonecrop gleamed. \\n\\n\\'They cannot conquer for ever!\\' said Frodo. And then suddenly the brief \\nglimpse was gone. The Sun dipped and vanished, and as if at the shuttering \\nof a lamp, black night fell. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 8 . The Stairs of Cirith Ungol \\n\\n\\n\\nGollum was tugging at Frodo\\'s cloak and hissing with fear and \\nimpatience. \\'We must go,\\' he said. \\'We mustn\\'t stand here. Make haste!\\' \\n\\nReluctantly Frodo turned his back on the West and followed as his guide \\nled him, out into the darkness of the East. They left the ring of trees and \\ncrept along the road towards the mountains. This road, too, ran straight for \\na while, but soon it began to bend away southwards, until it came right \\nunder the great shoulder of rock that they had seen from the distance. Black \\nand forbidding it loomed above them, darker than the dark sky behind. \\nCrawling under its shadow the road went on, and rounding it sprang east \\nagain and began to climb steeply. \\n\\nFrodo and Sam were plodding along with heavy hearts, no longer able to \\ncare greatly about their peril. Frodo\\'s head was bowed; his burden was \\ndragging him down again. As soon as the great Cross-roads had been passed, \\nthe weight of it, almost forgotten in Ithilien, had begun to grow once more. \\nNow, feeling the way become steep before his feet, he looked wearily up; and \\nthen he saw it, even as Gollum had said that he would: the city of the \\nRingwraiths. He cowered against the stony bank. \\n\\nA long-tilted valley, a deep gulf of shadow, ran back far into the \\nmountains. Upon the further side, some way within the valley\\'s arms high on \\na rocky seat upon the black knees of the Ephel D(r)ath, stood the walls and \\ntower of Minas Morgul. All was dark about it, earth and sky, but it was lit \\nwith light. Not the imprisoned moonlight welling through the marble walls of \\nMinas Ithil long ago, Tower of the Moon, fair and radiant in the hollow of \\nthe hills. Paler indeed than the moon ailing in some slow eclipse was the \\nlight of it now, wavering and blowing like a noisome exhalation of decay, a \\ncorpse-light, a light that illuminated nothing. In the walls and tower \\nwindows showed, like countless black holes looking inward into emptiness; \\nbut the topmost course of the tower revolved slowly, first one way and then \\nanother, a huge ghostly head leering into the night. For a moment the three \\ncompanions stood there, shrinking, staring up with unwilling eyes. Gollum \\nwas the first to recover. Again he pulled at their cloaks urgently, but he \\nspoke no word. Almost he dragged them forward. Every step was reluctant, and \\ntime seemed to slow its pace, so that between the raising of a foot and the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsetting of it down minutes of loathing passed. \\n\\nSo they came slowly to the white bridge. Here the road, gleaming \\nfaintly, passed over the stream in the midst of the valley, and went on, \\nwinding deviously up towards the city\\'s gate: a black mouth opening in the \\nouter circle of the northward walls. Wide flats lay on either bank, shadowy \\nmeads filled with pale white flowers. Luminous these were too, beautiful and \\nyet horrible of shape, like the demented forms in an uneasy dream; and they \\ngave forth a faint sickening charnel-smell; an odour of rottenness filled \\nthe air. From mead to mead the bridge sprang. Figures stood there at its \\nhead, carven with cunning in forms human and bestial, but all corrupt and \\nloathsome. The water flowing beneath was silent, and it steamed, but the \\nvapour that rose from it, curling and twisting about the bridge, was deadly \\ncold. Frodo felt his senses reeling and his mind darkening. Then suddenly, \\nas if some force were at work other than his own will, he began to hurry, \\ntottering forward, his groping hands held out, his head lolling from side to \\nside. Both Sam and Gollum ran after him. Sam caught his master in his arms, \\nas he stumbled and almost fell, right on the threshold of the bridge. \\n\\n\\'Not that way! No, not that way! \\' whispered Gollum, but the breath \\nbetween his teeth seemed to tear the heavy stillness like a whistle, and he \\ncowered to the ground in terror. \\n\\n\\'Hold up, Mr. Frodo! \\' muttered Sam in Frodo\\'s ear. \\'Come back! Not \\nthat way. Gollum says not, and for once I agree with him.\\' \\n\\nFrodo passed his hand over his brow and wrenched his eyes away from the \\ncity on the hill. The luminous tower fascinated him, and he fought the \\ndesire that was on him to run up the gleaming road towards its gate. At last \\nwith an effort he turned back, and as he did so, he felt the Ring resisting \\nhim, dragging at the chain about his neck; and his eyes too, as he looked \\naway, seemed for the moment to have been blinded. The darkness before him \\nwas impenetrable. \\n\\nGollum, crawling on the ground like a frightened animal, was already \\nvanishing into the gloom. Sam, supporting and guiding his stumbling master, \\nfollowed after him as quickly as he could. Not far from the near bank of the \\nstream there was a gap in the stone-wall beside the road. Through this they \\npassed, and Sam saw that they were on a narrow path that gleamed faintly at \\nfirst, as the main road did, until climbing above the meads of deadly \\nflowers it faded and went dark, winding its crooked way up into the northern \\nsides of the valley. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlong this path the hobbits trudged, side by side, unable to see Gollum \\nin front of them, except when he turned back to beckon them on. Then his \\neyes shone with a green-white light, reflecting the noisome Morgul-sheen \\nperhaps, or kindled by some answering mood within. Of that deadly gleam and \\nof the dark eyeholes Frodo and Sam were always conscious, ever glancing \\nfearfully over their shoulders, and ever dragging their eyes back to find \\nthe darkening path. Slowly they laboured on. As they rose above the stench \\nand vapours of the poisonous stream their breath became easier and their \\nheads clearer; but now their limbs were deadly tired, as if they had walked \\nall night under a burden, or had been swimming long against a heavy tide of \\nwater. At last they could go no further without a halt. \\n\\nFrodo stopped and sat down on a stone. They had now climbed up to the \\ntop of a great hump of bare rock. Ahead of them there was a bay in the \\nvalley -side, and round the head of this the path went on, no more than a \\nwide ledge with a chasm on the right; across the sheer southward face of the \\nmountain it crawled upwards, until it disappeared into the blackness above. \\n\\n\\'I must rest a while, Sam,\\' whispered Frodo. \\'It\\'s heavy on me, Sam \\nlad, very heavy. I wonder how far I can carry it? Anyway I must rest before \\nwe venture on to that.\\' He pointed to the narrow way ahead. \\n\\n\\'Sssh! ssh! \\' hissed Gollum hurrying back to them. \\'Sssh! \\' His fingers \\nwere on his lips and he shook his head urgently. Tugging at Frodo\\'s sleeve, \\nhe pointed towards the path; but Frodo would not move. \\n\\n\\'Not yet,\\' he said, \\'not yet.\\' Weariness and more than weariness \\noppressed him; it seemed as if a heavy spell was laid on his mind and body. \\n\\n\\'I must rest,\\' he muttered. \\n\\nAt this Gollum\\'s fear and agitation became so great that he spoke \\nagain, hissing behind his hand, as if to keep the sound from unseen \\nlisteners in the air. \\'Not here, no. Not rest here. Fools! Eyes can see us. \\n\\nWhen they come to the bridge they will see us. Come away! Climb, climb! \\nCome! \\' \\n\\n\\'Come, Mr. Frodo,\\' said Sam. \\'He\\'s right, again. We can\\'t stay here.\\' \\n\\n\\'All right,\\' said Frodo in a remote voice, as of one speaking half \\nasleep. \\'I will try.\\' Wearily he got to his feet. \\n\\nBut it was too late. At that moment the rock quivered and trembled \\nbeneath them. The great rumbling noise, louder than ever before, rolled in \\nthe ground and echoed in the mountains. Then with searing suddenness there \\ncame a great red flash. Far beyond the eastern mountains it leapt into the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsky and splashed the lowering clouds with crimson. In that valley of shadow \\nand cold deathly light it seemed unbearably violent and fierce. Peaks of \\nstone and ridges like notched knives sprang out in staring black against the \\nuprushing flame in Gorgoroth. Then came a great crack of thunder. \\n\\nAnd Minas Morgul answered. There was a flare of livid lightnings: forks \\nof blue flame springing up from the tower and from the encircling hills into \\nthe sullen clouds. The earth groaned; and out of the city there came a cry. \\nMingled with harsh high voices as of birds of prey, and the shrill neighing \\nof horses wild with rage and fear, there came a rending screech, shivering, \\nrising swiftly to a piercing pitch beyond the range of hearing. The hobbits \\nwheeled round towards it, and cast themselves down, holding their hands upon \\ntheir ears. \\n\\nAs the terrible cry ended, falling back through a long sickening wail \\nto silence, Frodo slowly raised his head. Across the narrow valley, now \\nalmost on a level with his eyes, the walls of the evil city stood, and its \\ncavernous gate, shaped like an open mouth with gleaming teeth, was gaping \\nwide. And out of the gate an army came. \\n\\nAll that host was clad in sable, dark as the night. Against the wan \\nwalls and the luminous pavement of the road Frodo could see them, small \\nblack figures in rank upon rank, marching swiftly and silently, passing \\noutwards in an endless stream. Before them went a great cavalry of horsemen \\nmoving like ordered shadows, and at their head was one greater than all the \\nrest: a Rider, all black, save that on his hooded head he had a helm like a \\ncrown that flickered with a perilous light. Now he was drawing near the \\nbridge below, and Frodo\\'s staring eyes followed him, unable to wink or to \\nwithdraw. Surely there was the Lord of the Nine Riders returned to earth to \\nlead his ghastly host to battle? Here, yes here indeed was the haggard king \\nwhose cold hand had smitten down the Ring-bearer with his deadly knife. The \\nold wound throbbed with pain and a great chill spread towards Frodo\\'s heart. \\n\\nEven as these thoughts pierced him with dread and held him bound as \\nwith a spell, the Rider halted suddenly, right before the entrance of the \\nbridge, and behind him all the host stood still. There was a pause, a dead \\nsilence. Maybe it was the Ring that called to the Wraith-lord, and for a \\nmoment he was troubled, sensing some other power within his valley. This way \\nand that turned the dark head helmed and crowned with fear, sweeping the \\nshadows with its unseen eyes. Frodo waited, like a bird at the approach of a \\nsnake, unable to move. And as he waited, he felt, more urgent than ever \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbefore, the command that he should put on the Ring. But great as the \\npressure was, he felt no inclination now to yield to it. He knew that the \\nRing would only betray him, and that he had not, even if he put it on, the \\npower to face the Morgul-king-not yet. There was no longer any answer to \\nthat command in his own will, dismayed by terror though it was, and he felt \\nonly the beating upon him of a great power from outside. It took his hand, \\nand as Frodo watched with his mind, not willing it but in suspense (as if he \\nlooked on some old story far away), it moved the hand inch by inch towards \\nthe chain upon his neck. Then his own will stirred; slowly it forced the \\nhand back, and set it to find another thing, a thing lying hidden near his \\nbreast. Cold and hard it seemed as his grip closed on it: the phial of \\nGaladriel, so long treasured, and almost forgotten till that hour. As he \\ntouched it, for a while all thought of the Ring was banished from his mind. \\n\\nHe sighed and bent his head. \\n\\nAt that moment the Wraith-king turned and spurred his horse and rode \\nacross the bridge, and all his dark host followed him. Maybe the elven-hoods \\ndefied his unseen eyes, and the mind of his small enemy; being strengthened, \\nhad turned aside his thought. But he was in haste. Already the hour had \\nstruck, and at his great Master\\'s bidding he must march with war into the \\nWest. \\n\\nSoon he had passed, like a shadow into shadow, down the winding road, \\nand behind him still the black ranks crossed the bridge. So great an army \\nhad never issued from that vale since the days of Isildur\\'s might; no host \\nso fell and strong in arms had yet assailed the fords of Anduin; and yet it \\nwas but one and not the greatest of the hosts that Mordor now sent forth. \\n\\nFrodo stirred. And suddenly his heart went out to Faramir. \\'The storm \\nhas burst at last,\\' he thought. \\'This great array of spears and swords is \\ngoing to Osgiliath. Will Faramir get across in time? He guessed it, but did \\nhe know the hour? And who can now hold the fords when the King of the \\nNine \\n\\nRiders comes? And other armies will come. I am too late. All is lost. I \\ntarried on the way. All is lost. Even if my errand is performed, no one will \\never know. There will be no one I can tell. It will be in vain.\\' Overcome \\nwith weakness he wept. And still the host of Morgul crossed the bridge. \\n\\nThen at a great distance, as if it came out of memories of the Shire, \\nsome sunlit early morning, when the day called and doors were opening, he \\nheard Sam\\'s voice speaking. \\'Wake up, Mr. Frodo! Wake up! \\' Had the voice \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nadded: \\'Your breakfast is ready,\\' he would hardly have been surprised. \\nCertainly Sam was urgent. \\'Wake up, Mr. Frodo! They\\'re gone,\\' he said. \\n\\nThere was a dull clang. The gates of Minas Morgul had closed. The last \\nrank of spears had vanished down the road. The tower still grinned across \\nthe valley, but the light was fading in it. The whole city was falling back \\ninto a dark brooding shade, and silence. Yet still it was filled with \\nwatchfulness. \\n\\n\\'Wake up, Mr. Frodo! They\\'re gone, and we\\'d better go too. There\\'s \\nsomething still alive in that place, something with eyes, or a seeing mind, \\nif you take me; and the longer we stay in one spot, the sooner it will get \\non to us. Come on, Mr. Frodo! \\' \\n\\nFrodo raised his head, and then stood up. Despair had not left him, but \\nthe weakness had passed. He even smiled grimly, feeling now as clearly as a \\nmoment before he had felt the opposite, that what he had to do, he had to \\ndo, if he could, and that whether Faramir or Aragorn or Elrond or Galadriel \\nor Gandalf or anyone else ever knew about it was beside the purpose. He took \\nhis staff in one hand and the phial in his other. When he saw that the clear \\nlight was already welling through his fingers, he thrust it into his bosom \\nand held it against his heart. Then turning from the city of Morgul, now no \\nmore than a grey glimmer across a dark gulf, he prepared to take the upward \\nroad. \\n\\nGollum, it seemed, had crawled off along the ledge into the darkness \\nbeyond, when the gates of Minas Morgul opened, leaving the hobbits where \\nthey lay. He now came creeping back, his teeth chattering and his fingers \\nsnapping. \\'Foolish! Silly! \\' he hissed. \\'Make haste! They mustn\\'t think \\ndanger has passed. It hasn\\'t. Make haste! \\' \\n\\nThey did not answer, but they followed him on to the climbing ledge. It \\nwas little to the liking of either of them, not even after facing so many \\nother perils; but it did not last long. Soon the path reached a rounded \\nangle where the mountain-side swelled out again, and there it suddenly \\nentered a narrow opening in the rock. They had come to the first stair that \\nGollum had spoken of. The darkness was almost complete, and they could see \\nnothing much beyond their hands\\' stretch; but Gollum\\'s eyes shone pale, \\nseveral feet above, as he turned back towards them. \\n\\n\\'Careful! \\' he whispered. \\'Steps. Lots of steps. Must be careful! \\' \\n\\nCare was certainly needed. Frodo and Sam at first felt easier, having \\nnow a wall on either side, but the stairway was almost as steep as a ladder, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand as they climbed up and up, they became more and more aware of the long \\nblack fall behind them. And the steps were narrow, spaced unevenly, and \\noften treacherous: they were worn and smooth at the edges, and some were \\nbroken, and some cracked as foot was set upon them. The hobbits struggled \\non, until at last they were clinging with desperate fingers to the steps \\nahead, and forcing their aching knees to bend and straighten; and ever as \\nthe stair cut its way deeper into the sheer mountain the rocky walls rose \\nhigher and higher above their heads. \\n\\nAt length, just as they felt that they could endure no more, they saw \\nGollum\\'s eyes peering down at them again. \\'We\\'re up,\\' he whispered. \\'First \\nstair\\'s past. Clever hobbits to climb so high, very clever hobbits. Just a \\nfew more little steps and that\\'s all, yes.\\' \\n\\nDizzy and very tired Sam, and Frodo following him, crawled up the last \\nstep, and sat down rubbing their legs and knees. They were in a deep dark \\npassage that seemed still to go up before them, though at a gentler slope \\nand without steps. Gollum did not let them rest long. \\n\\n\\'There\\'s another stair still,\\' he said. \\'Much longer stair. Rest when \\nwe get to the top of next stair. Not yet.\\' \\n\\nSam groaned. \\'Longer, did you say? \\' he asked. \\n\\n\\'Yes, yess, longer,\\' said Gollum. \\'But not so difficult. Hobbits have \\nclimbed the Straight Stair. Next comes the Winding Stair.\\' \\n\\n\\'And what after that? \\' said Sam. \\n\\n\\'We shall see,\\' said Gollum softly. \\'O yes, we shall see! \\' \\n\\n\\'I thought you said there was a tunnel,\\' said Sam. \\'Isn\\'t there a \\ntunnel or something to go through? \\' \\n\\n\\'O yes, there\\'s a tunnel,\\' said Gollum. \\'But hobbits can rest before \\nthey try that. If they get through that, they\\'ll be nearly at the top. Very \\nnearly, if they get through. O yes ! \\' \\n\\nFrodo shivered. The climb had made him sweat, but now he felt cold and \\nclammy, and there was a chill draught in the dark passage, blowing down from \\nthe invisible heights above. He got up and shook himself. \\'Well, let\\'s go \\non! \\'he said. \\'This is no place to sit in.\\' \\n\\nThe passage seemed to go on for miles, and always the chill air flowed \\nover them, rising as they went on to a bitter wind. The mountains seemed to \\nbe trying with their deadly breath to daunt them, to turn them back from the \\nsecrets of the high places, or to blow them away into the darkness behind. \\nThey only knew that they had come to the end, when suddenly they felt no \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwall at their right hand. They could see very little. Great black shapeless \\nmasses and deep grey shadows loomed above them and about them, but now \\nand \\n\\nagain a dull red light flickered up under the lowering clouds, and for a \\nmoment they were aware of tall peaks, in front and on either side, like \\npillars holding up a vast sagging roof. They seemed to have climbed up many \\nhundreds of feet, on to a wide shelf. A cliff was on their left and a chasm \\non their right. \\n\\nGollum led the way close under the cliff. For the present they were no \\nlonger climbing, but the ground was now more broken and dangerous in the \\ndark, and there were blocks and lumps of fallen stone in the way. Their \\ngoing was slow and cautious. How many hours had passed since they had \\nentered the Morgul Vale neither Sam nor Frodo could any longer guess. The \\nnight seemed endless. \\n\\nAt length they were once more aware of a wall looming up, and once more \\na stairway opened before them. Again they halted, and again they began to \\nclimb. It was a long and weary ascent; but this stairway did not delve into \\nthe mountain -side. Here the huge cliff face sloped backwards, and the path \\nlike a snake wound to and fro across it. At one point it crawled sideways \\nright to the edge of the dark chasm, and Frodo glancing down saw below him \\nas a vast deep pit the great ravine at the head of the Morgul Valley. Down \\nin its depths glimmered like a glow-worm thread the wraith-road from the \\ndead city to the Nameless Pass. He turned hastily away. \\n\\nStill on and up the stairway bent and crawled, until at last with a \\nfinal flight, short and straight, it climbed out again on to another level. \\n\\nThe path had veered away from the main pass in the great ravine, and it now \\nfollowed its own perilous course at the bottom of a lesser cleft among the \\nhigher regions of the Ephel D(r)ath. Dimly the hobbits could discern tall \\npiers and jagged pinnacles of stone on either side, between which were great \\ncrevices and fissures blacker than the night, where forgotten winters had \\ngnawed and carved the sunless stone. And now the red light in the sky seemed \\nstronger; though they could not tell whether a dreadful morning were indeed \\ncoming to this place of shadow, or whether they saw only the flame of some \\ngreat violence of Sauron in the torment of Gorgoroth beyond. Still far \\nahead, and still high above, Frodo, looking up, saw, as he guessed, the very \\ncrown of this bitter road. Against the sullen redness of the eastern sky a \\ncleft was outlined in the topmost ridge, narrow, deep-cloven between two \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nblack shoulders; and on either shoulder was a horn of stone. \\n\\nHe paused and looked more attentively. The horn upon the left was tall \\nand slender; and in it burned a red light, or else the red light in the land \\nbeyond was shining through a hole. He saw now: it was a black tower poised \\nabove the outer pass. He touched Sam\\'s arm and pointed. \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t like the look of that! \\' said Sam. \\'So this secret way of \\nyours is guarded after all,\\' he growled, turning to Gollum. \\'As you knew all \\nalong, I suppose? \\' \\n\\n\\'All ways are watched, yes,\\' said Gollum. \\'Of course they are. But \\nhobbits must try some way. This may be least watched. Perhaps they\\'ve all \\ngone away to big battle, perhaps ! \\' \\n\\n\\'Perhaps,\\' grunted Sam. \\'Well, it still seems a long way off, and a \\nlong way up before we get there. And there\\'s still the tunnel. I think you \\nought to rest now, Mr. Frodo. I don\\'t know what time of day or night it is, \\nbut we\\'ve kept going for hours and hours.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, we must rest,\\' said Frodo. \\'Let us find some corner out of the \\nwind, and gather our strength-for the last lap.\\' For so he felt it to be. \\n\\nThe terrors of the land beyond, and the deed to be done there, seemed \\nremote, too far off yet to trouble him. All his mind was bent on getting \\nthrough or over this impenetrable wall and guard. If once he could do that \\nimpossible thing, then somehow the errand would be accomplished, or so it \\nseemed to him in that dark hour of weariness, still labouring in the stony \\nshadows under Cirith Ungol. \\n\\nIn a dark crevice between two great piers of rock they sat down: Frodo \\nand Sam a little way within, and Gollum crouched upon the ground near the \\nopening. There the hobbits took what they expected would be their last meal \\nbefore they went down into the Nameless Land, maybe the last meal they \\nwould \\n\\never eat together. Some of the food of Gondor they ate, and wafers of the \\nwaybread of the Elves, and they drank a little. But of their water they were \\nsparing and took only enough to moisten their dry mouths. \\n\\n\\'I wonder when we\\'ll find water again? \\' said Sam. \\'But I suppose even \\nover there they drink? Ores drink, don\\'t they? \\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, they drink,\\' said Frodo. \\'But do not let us speak of that. Such \\ndrink is not for us.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then all the more need to fill our bottles,\\' said Sam. \\'But there \\nisn\\'t any water up here: not a sound or a trickle have I heard. And anyway \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFaramir said we were not to drink any water in Morgul.\\' \\n\\n\\'No water flowing out of Imlad Morgul, were his words,\\' said Frodo. \\'We \\nare not in that valley now, and if we came on a spring it would be flowing \\ninto it and not out of it.\\' \\n\\n\\'I wouldn\\'t trust it,\\' said Sam, \\'not till I was dying of thirst. \\n\\nThere\\'s a wicked feeling about this place.\\' Fie sniffed. \\'And a smell, I \\nfancy. Do you notice it? A queer kind of a smell, stuffy. I don\\'t like it.\\' \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t like anything here at all.\\' said Frodo, \\'step or stone, breath \\nor bone. Earth, air and water all seem accursed. But so our path is laid.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, that\\'s so,\\' said Sam. \\'And we shouldn\\'t be here at all, if we\\'d \\nknown more about it before we started. But I suppose it\\'s often that way. \\nThe brave things in the old tales and songs, Mr. Frodo: adventures, as I \\nused to call them. I used to think that they were things the wonderful folk \\nof the stories went out and looked for, because they wanted them, because \\nthey were exciting and life was a bit dull, a kind of a sport, as you might \\nsay. But that\\'s not the way of it with the tales that really mattered, or \\nthe ones that stay in the mind. Folk seem to have been just landed in them, \\nusually -- their paths were laid that way, as you put it. But I expect they \\nhad lots of chances, like us, of turning back, only they didn\\'t. And if they \\nhad, we shouldn\\'t know, because they\\'d have been forgotten. We hear about \\nthose as just went on -- and not all to a good end, mind you; at least not \\nto what folk inside a story and not outside it call a good end. You know, \\ncoming home, and finding things all right, though not quite the same -- like \\nold Mr Bilbo. But those aren\\'t always the best tales to hear, though they \\nmay be the best tales to get landed in! I wonder what sort of a tale we\\'ve \\nfallen into? \\' \\n\\n\\'I wonder,\\' said Frodo. \\'But I don\\'t know. And that\\'s the way of a real \\ntale. Take any one that you\\'re fond of. You may know, or guess, what kind of \\na tale it is, happy-ending or sad-ending, but the people in it don\\'t know. \\n\\nAnd you don\\'t want them to.\\' \\n\\n\\'No, sir, of course not. Beren now, he never thought he was going to \\nget that Silmaril from the Iron Crown in Thangorodrim, and yet he did, and \\nthat was a worse place and a blacker danger than ours. But that\\'s a long \\ntale, of course, and goes on past the happiness and into grief and beyond it \\n-- and the Silmaril went on and came to Edrendil. And why, sir, I never \\nthought of that before! We\\'ve got -- you\\'ve got some of the light of it in \\nthat star-glass that the Lady gave you! Why, to think of it, we\\'re in the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsame tale still! It\\'s going on. Don\\'t the great tales never end? \\' \\n\\n\\'No, they never end as tales,\\' said Frodo. \\'But the people in them \\ncome, and go when their part\\'s ended. Our part will end later -- or sooner.\\' \\n\\n\\'And then we can have some rest and some sleep,\\' said Sam. He laughed \\ngrimly. \\'And I mean just that, Mr. Frodo. I mean plain ordinary rest, and \\nsleep, and waking up to a morning\\'s work in the garden. I\\'m afraid that\\'s \\nall I\\'m hoping for all the time. All the big important plans are not for my \\nsort. Still, I wonder if we shall ever be put into songs or tales. We\\'re in \\none, or course; but I mean: put into words, you know, told by the fireside, \\nor read out of a great big book with red and black letters, years and years \\nafterwards. And people will say: \"Let\\'s hear about Frodo and the Ring! \" And \\nthey\\'ll say: \"Yes, that\\'s one of my favourite stories. Frodo was very brave, \\nwasn\\'t he, dad?\" \"Yes, my boy, the famousest of the hobbits, and that\\'s \\nsaying a lot.\\'\" \\n\\n\\'It\\'s saying a lot too much,\\' said Frodo, and he laughed, a long clear \\nlaugh from his heart. Such a sound had not been heard in those places since \\nSauron came to Middle-earth. To Sam suddenly it seemed as if all the stones \\nwere listening and the tall rocks leaning over them. But Frodo did not heed \\nthem; he laughed again. \\'Why, Sam,\\' he said, \\'to hear you somehow makes me \\nas merry as if the story was already written. But you\\'ve left out one of the \\nchief characters: Samwise the stouthearted. \"I want to hear more about Sam, \\ndad. Why didn\\'t they put in more of his talk, dad? That\\'s what I like, it \\nmakes me laugh. And Frodo wouldn\\'t have got far without Sam, would he, \\ndad? \\n\\nft f \\n\\n\\'Now, Mr. Frodo,\\' said Sam, \\'you shouldn\\'t make fun. I was serious. \\' \\n\\n\\'So was I,\\' said Frodo, \\'and so I am. We\\'re going on a bit too fast. \\n\\nYou and I, Sam, are still stuck in the worst places of the story, and it is \\nall too likely that some will say at this point: \"Shut the book now, dad; we \\ndon\\'t want to read any more.\" \\' \\n\\n\\'Maybe,\\' said Sam, \\'but I wouldn\\'t be one to say that. Things done and \\nover and made into part of the great tales are different. Why, even Gollum \\nmight be good in a tale, better than he is to have by you, anyway. And he \\nused to like tales himself once, by his own account. I wonder if he thinks \\nhe\\'s the hero or the villain? \\n\\n\\'Gollum!\\' he called. \\'Would you like to be the hero -- now where\\'s he \\ngot to again?\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was no sign of him at the mouth of their shelter nor in the \\nshadows near. He had refused their food, though he had, as usual, accepted a \\nmouthful of water; and then he had seemed to curl up for a sleep: They had \\nsupposed that one at any rate of his objects in his long absence the day \\nbefore had been to hunt for food to his own liking; and now he had evidently \\nslipped off again while they talked. But what for this time? \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t like his sneaking off without saying,\\' said Sam. \\'And least of \\nall now. He can\\'t be looking for food up here, not unless there\\'s some kind \\nof rock he fancies. Why, there isn\\'t even a bit of moss! \\' \\n\\n\"It\\'s no good worrying about him now,\\' said Frodo. \\'We couldn\\'t have \\ngot so far, not even within sight of the pass, without him, and so we\\'ll \\nhave to put up with his ways. If he\\'s false, he\\'s false.\\' \\n\\n\\'All the same, I\\'d rather have him under my eye,\\' said Sam. \\'All the \\nmore so, if he\\'s false. Do you remember he never would say if this pass was \\nguarded or no? And now we see a tower there -- and it may be deserted, and \\nit may not. Do you think he\\'s gone to fetch them, Ores or whatever they \\nare?\\' \\n\\n\\'No, I don\\'t think so,\\' answered Frodo. \\'Even if he\\'s up to some \\nwickedness, and I suppose that\\'s not unlikely, I don\\'t think it\\'s that: not \\nto fetch Ores, or any servants of the Enemy. Why wait till now, and go \\nthrough all the labour of the climb, and come so near the land he fears? He \\ncould probably have betrayed us to Ores many times since we met him. No, if \\nit\\'s anything, it will be some little private trick of his own-that he \\nthinks is quite secret.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, I suppose you\\'re right, Mr. Frodo,\\' said Sam. \\'Not that it \\ncomforts me mightily. I don\\'t make no mistake: I don\\'t doubt he\\'d hand me \\nover to Ores as gladly as kiss his hand. But I was forgetting -- his \\nPrecious. No, I suppose the whole time it\\'s been The Precious for poor \\nSmjagol. That\\'s the one idea in all his little schemes, if he has any. But \\nhow bringing us up here will help him in that is more than I can guess.\\' \\n\\n\\'Very likely he can\\'t guess himself,\\' said Frodo. \\'And I don\\'t think \\nhe\\'s got just one plain scheme in his muddled head. I think he really is in \\npart trying to save the Precious from the Enemy, as long as he can. For that \\nwould be the last disaster for himself too. if the Enemy got it. And in the \\nother part, perhaps, he\\'s just biding his time and waiting on chance.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, Slinker and Stinker, as I\\'ve said before,\\' said Sam. \\'But the \\nnearer they get to the Enemy\\'s land the more like Stinker Slinker will get. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMark my words: if ever we get to the pass, he won\\'t let us really take the \\nprecious thing over the border without making some kind of trouble.\\' \\n\\n\\'We haven\\'t got there yet,\\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'No, but we\\'d better keep our eyes skinned till we do. If we\\'re caught \\nnapping, Stinker will come out on top pretty quick. Not but what it would be \\nsafe for you to have a wink now, master. Safe, if you lay close to me. I\\'d \\nbe dearly glad to see you have a sleep. I\\'d keep watch over you; and anyway, \\nif you lay near, with my arm round you, no one could come pawing you \\nwithout \\n\\nyour Sam knowing it.\\' \\n\\n\\'Sleep!\\' said Frodo and sighed, as if out of a desert he had seen a \\nmirage of cool green. \\'Yes, even here I could sleep.\\' \\n\\n\\'Sleep then, master! Lay your head in my lap.\\' \\n\\nAnd so Gollum found them hours later, when he returned, crawling and \\ncreeping down the path out of the gloom ahead. Sam sat propped against the \\nstone, his head dropping sideways and his breathing heavy. In his lap lay \\nFrodo\\'s head, drowned deep in sleep; upon his white forehead lay one of \\nSam\\'s brown hands, and the other lay softly upon his master\\'s breast. Peace \\nwas in both their faces. \\n\\nGollum looked at them. A strange expression passed over his lean hungry \\nface. The gleam faded from his eyes, and they went dim and grey, old and \\ntired. A spasm of pain seemed to twist him, and he turned away, peering back \\nup towards the pass, shaking his head, as if engaged in some interior \\ndebate. Then he came back, and slowly putting out a trembling hand, very \\ncautiously he touched Frodo\\'s knee -- but almost the touch was a caress. For \\na fleeting moment, could one of the sleepers have seen him, they would have \\nthought that they beheld an old weary hobbit, shrunken by the years that had \\ncarried him far beyond his time, beyond friends and kin, and the fields and \\nstreams of youth, an old starved pitiable thing. \\n\\nBut at that touch Frodo stirred and cried out softly in his sleep, and \\nimmediately Sam was wide awake. The first thing he saw was Gollum -- \\n\\'pawing \\n\\nat master,\\' as he thought. \\n\\n\\'Hey you!\\' he said roughly. \\'What are you up to?\\' \\n\\n\\'Nothing, nothing,\\' said Gollum softly. \\'Nice Master!\\' \\n\\n\\'I daresay,\\' said Sam. \\'But where have you been to -- sneaking off and \\nsneaking back, you old villain? \\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGollum withdrew himself, and a green glint flickered under his heavy \\nlids. Almost spider -like he looked now, crouched back on his bent limbs, \\nwith his protruding eyes. The fleeting moment had passed, beyond recall. \\n\\'Sneaking, sneaking!\\' he hissed. \\'Hobbits always so polite, yes. O nice \\nhobbits! Smjagol brings them up secret ways that nobody else could find. \\nTired he is, thirsty he is, yes thirsty; and he guides them and he searches \\nfor paths, and they say sneak, sneak. Very nice friends, O yes my precious, \\nvery nice.\\' \\n\\nSam felt a bit remorseful, though not more trustful. \\'Sorry.\\' he said. \\n\\n\\'I\\'m sorry, but you startled me out of my sleep. And I shouldn\\'t have been \\nsleeping, and that made me a bit sharp. But Mr. Frodo. he\\'s that tired, I \\nasked him to have a wink; and well, that\\'s how it is. Sorry. But where have \\nyou been to? \\' \\n\\n\\'Sneaking,\\' said Gollum, and the green glint did not leave his eyes. \\n\\n\\'O very well,\\' said Sam, \\'have it your own way! I don\\'t suppose it\\'s so \\nfar from the truth. And now we\\'d better all be sneaking along together. \\nWhat\\'s the time? Is it today or tomorrow? \\' \\n\\n\\'It\\'s tomorrow,\\' said Gollum, \\'or this was tomorrow when hobbits went \\nto sleep. Very foolish, very dangerous-if poor Smjagol wasn\\'t sneaking about \\nto watch.\\' \\n\\n\\'I think we shall get tired of that word soon,\\' said Sam. \\'But never \\nmind. I\\'ll wake master up.\\' Gently he smoothed the hair back from Frodo\\'s \\nbrow, and bending down spoke softly to him. \\n\\n\\'Wake up, Mr. Frodo! Wake up! \\' \\n\\nFrodo stirred and opened his eyes, and smiled, seeing Sam\\'s face \\nbending over him. \\'Calling me early aren\\'t you, Sam?\\' he said. \\'It\\'s dark \\nstill! \\' \\n\\n\\'Yes it\\'s always dark here,\\' said Sam. \\'But Gollum\\' s come back Mr. \\nFrodo, and he says it\\'s tomorrow. So we must be walking on. The last lap.\\' \\n\\nFrodo drew a deep breath and sat up. \\'The last lap! \\' he said. \\'Hullo, \\nSmjagol! Found any food? Have you had any rest? \\' \\n\\n\\'No food, no rest, nothing for Smjagol,\\' said Gollum. \\'He\\'s a sneak.\\' \\n\\nSam clicked his tongue, but restrained himself. \\n\\n\\'Don\\'t take names to yourself, Smjagol,\\' said Frodo. \\'It\\'s unwise \\nwhether they are true or false.\\' \\n\\n\\'Smjagol has to take what\\'s given him,\\' answered Gollum. \\'He was given \\nthat name by kind Master Samwise, the hobbit that knows so much.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrodo looked at Sam. \\'Yes sir,\\' he said. \\'I did use the word, waking up \\nout of my sleep sudden and all and finding him at hand. I said I was sorry, \\nbut I soon shan\\'t be.\\' \\n\\n\\'Come, let it pass then,\\' said Frodo. \\'But now we seem to have come to \\nthe point, you and I, Smjagol. Tell me. Can we find the rest of the way by \\nourselves? We\\'re in sight of the pass, of a way in, and if we can find it \\nnow, then I suppose our agreement can be said to be over. You have done what \\nyou promised, and you\\'re free: free to go back to food and rest, wherever \\nyou wish to go, except to servants of the Enemy. And one day I may reward \\nyou, I or those that remember me.\\' \\n\\n\\'No, no, not yet,\\' Gollum whined. \\'O no! They can\\'t find the way \\nthemselves, can they? O no indeed. There\\'s the tunnel coming. Smjagol must \\ngo on. No rest. No food. Not yet.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 9 . Shelob \\' s Lair \\n\\n\\n\\nIt may indeed have been daytime now, as Gollum said, but the hobbits \\ncould see little difference, unless, perhaps, the heavy sky above was less \\nutterly black, more like a great roof of smoke; while instead of the \\ndarkness of deep night, which lingered still in cracks and holes, a grey \\nblurring shadow shrouded the stony world about them. They passed on, \\nGollum \\n\\nin front and the hobbits now side by side, up the long ravine between the \\npiers and columns of torn and weathered rock, standing like huge unshapen \\nstatues on either hand. There was no sound. Some way ahead, a mile or so, \\nperhaps, was a great grey wall, a last huge upthrusting mass of \\nmountain- stone. Darker it loomed, and steadily it rose as they approached, \\nuntil it towered up high above them, shutting out the view of all that lay \\nbeyond. Deep shadow lay before its feet. Sam sniffed the air. \\n\\n\\'Ugh! That smell!\\' he said. \\'It\\'s getting stronger and stronger.\\' \\n\\nPresently they were under the shadow, and there in the midst of it they \\nsaw the opening of a cave. \\'This is the way in,\\' said Gollum softly. \\'This \\nis the entrance to the tunnel.\\' He did not speak its name: Torech Ungol, \\nShelob\\'s Lair. Out of it came a stench, not the sickly odour of decay in the \\nmeads of Morgul, but a foul reek, as if filth unnameable were piled and \\nhoarded in the dark within. \\n\\n\\'Is this the only way, Smjagol? \\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'Yes, yes,\\' he answered. \\'Yes, we must go this way now.\\' \\n\\n\\'D\\'you mean to say you\\'ve been through this hole?\\' said Sam. \\'Phew! But \\nperhaps you don\\'t mind bad smells.\\' \\n\\nGollum\\'s eyes glinted. \\'He doesn\\'t know what we minds, does he \\nprecious? No, he doesn\\'t. But Smjagol can bear things. Yes. He\\'s been \\nthrough. O yes, right through. It\\'s the only way.\\' \\n\\n\\'And what makes the smell, I wonder,\\' said Sam. \\'It\\'s like -- well, I \\nwouldn\\'t like to say. Some beastly hole of the Ores, I\\'ll warrant, with a \\nhundred years of their filth in it.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well,\\' said Frodo, \\'Ores or no, if it\\'s the only way, we must take \\nit.\\' \\n\\nDrawing a deep breath they passed inside. In a few steps they were in \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nutter and impenetrable dark. Not since the lightless passages of Moria had \\nFrodo or Sam known such darkness, and if possible here it was deeper and \\ndenser. There, there were airs moving, and echoes, and a sense of space. \\n\\nHere the air was still, stagnant, heavy, and sound fell dead. They walked as \\nit were in a black vapour wrought of veritable darkness itself that, as it \\nwas breathed, brought blindness not only to the eyes but to the mind, so \\nthat even the memory of colours and of forms and of any light faded out of \\nthought. Night always had been, and always would be, and night was all. \\n\\nBut for a while they could still feel, and indeed the senses of their \\nfeet and fingers at first seemed sharpened almost painfully. The walls felt, \\nto their surprise, smooth, and the floor, save for a step now and again, was \\nstraight and even, going ever up at the same stiff slope. The tunnel was \\nhigh and wide, so wide that, though the hobbits walked abreast, only \\ntouching the side- walls with their outstretched hands, they were separated, \\ncut off alone in the darkness. \\n\\nGollum had gone in first and seemed to be only a few steps ahead. While \\nthey were still able to give heed to such things, they could hear his breath \\nhissing and gasping just in front of them. But after a time their senses \\nbecame duller, both touch and hearing seemed to grow numb, and they kept on, \\ngroping, walking, on and on, mainly by the force of the will with which they \\nhad entered, will to go through and desire to come at last to the high gate \\nbeyond. \\n\\nBefore they had gone very far, perhaps, but time and distance soon \\npassed out of his reckoning, Sam on the right, feeling the wall, was aware \\nthat there was an opening at the side: for a moment he caught a faint breath \\nof some air less heavy, and then they passed it by. \\n\\n\\'There\\'s more than one passage here,\\' he whispered with an effort: it \\nseemed hard to make his breath give any sound. \\'It\\'s as ore-like a place as \\never there could be ! \\' \\n\\nAfter that, first he on the right, and then Frodo on the left, passed \\nthree or four such openings, some wider, some smaller; but there was as yet \\nno doubt of the main way, for it was straight, and did not turn, and still \\nwent steadily up. But how long was it, how much more of this would they have \\nto endure, or could they endure? The breathlessness of the air was growing \\nas they climbed; and now they seemed often in the blind dark to sense some \\nresistance thicker than the foul air. As they thrust forward they felt \\nthings brush against their heads, or against their hands, long tentacles, or \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhanging growths perhaps: they could not tell what they were. And still the \\nstench grew. It grew, until almost it seemed to them that smell was the only \\nclear sense left t0 them, and that was for their torment. One hour, two \\nhours, three hours: how many had they passed in this lightless hole? \\nHours-days, weeks rather. Sam left the tunnel-side and shrank towards Frodo, \\nand their hands met and clasped, and so together they still went on. \\n\\nAt length Frodo, groping along the left-hand wall, came suddenly to a \\nvoid. Almost he fell sideways into the emptiness. Here was some opening in \\nthe rock far wider than any they had yet passed; and out of it came a reek \\nso foul, and a sense of lurking malice so intense, that Frodo reeled. And at \\nthat moment Sam too lurched and fell forwards. \\n\\nFighting off both the sickness and the fear, Frodo gripped Sam\\'s hand. \\n\\'Up! \\' he said in a hoarse breath without voice. \\'It all comes from here, \\nthe stench and the peril. Now for it! Quick! \\' \\n\\nCalling up his remaining strength and resolution, he dragged Sam to his \\nfeet, and forced his own limbs to move. Sam stumbled beside him. One step, \\ntwo steps, three steps-at last six steps. Maybe they had passed the dreadful \\nunseen opening, but whether that was so or not, suddenly it was easier to \\nmove, as if some hostile will for the moment had released them. They \\nstruggled on, still hand in hand. \\n\\nBut almost at once they came to a new difficulty. The tunnel forked, or \\nso it seemed, and in the dark they could not tell which was the wider way, \\nor which kept nearer to the straight. Which should they take, the left, or \\nthe right? They knew of nothing to guide them, yet a false choice would \\nalmost certainly be fatal. \\n\\n\\'Which way has Gollum gone? \\' panted Sam. \\'And why didn\\'t he wait? \\' \\n\\n\\'Smjagol! \\'said Frodo, trying to call. \\'Smjagol! \\' But his voice \\ncroaked, and the name fell dead almost as it left his lips. There was no \\nanswer, not an echo, not even a tremor of the air. \\n\\n\\'He\\'s really gone this time, I fancy,\\' muttered Sam. \\'I guess this is \\njust exactly where he meant to bring us. Gollum! If ever I lay hands on you \\nagain, you\\'ll be sorry for it.\\' \\n\\nPresently, groping and fumbling in the dark, they found that the \\nopening on the left was blocked: either it was a blind, or else some great \\nstone had fallen in the passage. \\'This can\\'t be the way,\\' Frodo whispered. \\n\\'Right or wrong, we must take the other.\\' \\n\\n\\'And quick! \\' Sam panted. \\'There\\'s something worse than Gollum about. I \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncan feel something looking at us.\\' \\n\\nThey had not gone more than a few yards when from behind them came a \\nsound, startling and horrible in the heavy padded silence: a gurgling, \\nbubbling noise, and a long venomous hiss. They wheeled round, but nothing \\ncould be seen. Still as stones they stood, staring, waiting for they did not \\nknow what. \\n\\n\\'It\\'s a trap!\\' said Sam, and he laid his hand upon the hilt of his \\nsword; and as he did so, he thought of the darkness of the barrow whence it \\ncame. \\'I wish old Tom was near us now!\\' he thought. Then as he stood, \\ndarkness about him and a blackness of despair and anger in his heart, it \\nseemed to him that he saw a light: a light in his mind, almost unbearably \\nbright at first, as a sun-ray to the eyes of one long hidden in a windowless \\npit. Then the light became colour: green, gold, silver, white. Far off, as \\nin a little picture drawn by elven-fingers he saw the Lady Galadriel \\nstanding on the grass in Lurien, and gifts were in her hands. And you, \\nRing-bearer, he heard her say, remote but clear , for you I have prepared \\nthis. \\n\\nThe bubbling hiss drew nearer, and there was a creaking as of some \\ngreat jointed thing that moved with slow purpose in the dark. A reek came on \\nbefore it. \\'Master, master!\\' cried Sam, and the life and urgency came back \\ninto his voice. \\'The Lady\\'s gift! The star-glass! A light to you in dark \\nplaces, she said it was to be. The star-glass! \\' \\n\\n\\'The star-glass?\\' muttered Frodo, as one answering out of sleep, hardly \\ncomprehending. \\'Why yes! Why had I forgotten it? A light when all other \\nlights go out! And now indeed light alone can help us.\\' \\n\\nSlowly his hand went to his bosom, and slowly he held aloft the Phial \\nof Galadriel. For a moment it glimmered, faint as a rising star struggling \\nin heavy earthward mists, and then as its power waxed, and hope grew in \\nFrodo\\'s mind, it began to burn, and kindled to a silver flame, a minute \\nheart of dazzling light, as though Edrendil had himself come down from the \\nhigh sunset paths with the last Silmaril upon his brow. The darkness receded \\nfrom it until it seemed to shine in the centre of a globe of airy crystal, \\nand the hand that held it sparkled with white fire. \\n\\nFrodo gazed in wonder at this marvellous gift that he had so long \\ncarried, not guessing its full worth and potency. Seldom had he remembered \\nit on the road, until they came to Morgul Vale, and never had he used it for \\nfear of its revealing light. Aiya Edrendil Elenion Ancalima! he cried, and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nknew not what he had spoken; for it seemed that another voice spoke through \\nhis, clear, untroubled by the foul air of the pit. \\n\\nBut other potencies there are in Middle-earth, powers of night, and \\nthey are old and strong. And She that walked in the darkness had heard the \\nElves cry that cry far back in the deeps of time, and she had not heeded it, \\nand it did not daunt her now. Even as Frodo spoke he felt a great malice \\nbent upon him, and a deadly regard considering him. Not far down the tunnel, \\nbetween them and the opening where they had reeled and stumbled, he was \\naware of eyes growing visible, two great clusters of many-windowed eyes -- \\nthe coming menace was unmasked at last. The radiance of the star-glass was \\nbroken and thrown back from their thousand facets, but behind the glitter a \\npale deadly fire began steadily to glow within, a flame kindled in some deep \\npit of evil thought. Monstrous and abominable eyes they were, bestial and \\nyet filled with purpose and with hideous delight, gloating over their prey \\ntrapped beyond all hope of escape. \\n\\nFrodo and Sam, horror-stricken, began slowly to back away, their own \\ngaze held by the dreadful stare of those baleful eyes; but as they backed so \\nthe eyes advanced. Frodo\\'s hand wavered, and slowly the Phial drooped. Then \\nsuddenly, released from the holding spell to run a little while in vain \\npanic for the amusement of the eyes, they both turned and fled together; but \\neven as they ran Frodo looked back and saw with terror that at once the eyes \\ncame leaping up behind. The stench of death was like a cloud about him. \\n\\n\\'Stand! stand! \\' he cried desperately. \\'Running is no use.\\' \\n\\nSlowly the eyes crept nearer. \\n\\n\\'Galadriel! \\' he called, and gathering his courage he lifted up the \\nPhial once more. The eyes halted. For a moment their regard relaxed, as if \\nsome hint of doubt troubled them. Then Frodo\\'s heart flamed within him, and \\nwithout thinking what he did, whether it was folly or despair or courage, he \\ntook the Phial in his left hand, and with his right hand drew his sword. \\n\\nSting flashed out, and the sharp elven-blade sparkled in the silver light, \\nbut at its edges a blue fire flicked. Then holding the star aloft and the \\nbright sword advanced, Frodo, hobbit of the Shire, walked steadily down to \\nmeet the eyes. \\n\\nThey wavered. Doubt came into them as the light approached. One by one \\nthey dimmed, and slowly they drew back. No brightness so deadly had ever \\nafflicted them before. From sun and moon and star they had been safe \\nunderground, but now a star had descended into the very earth. Still it \\n\\n\\n\\n\\napproached, and the eyes began to quail. One by one they all went dark; they \\nturned away, and a great bulk, beyond the light\\'s reach, heaved its huge \\nshadow in between. They were gone. \\n\\n\\'Master, master!\\' cried Sam. He was close behind, his own sword drawn \\nand ready. \\'Stars and glory! But the Elves would make a song of that, if \\never they heard of it! And may I live to tell them and hear them sing. But \\ndon\\'t go on, master. Don\\'t go down to that den! Now\\'s our only chance. Now \\nlet\\'s get out of this foul hole!\\' \\n\\nAnd so back they turned once more, first walking and then running; for \\nas they went the floor of the tunnel rose steeply, and with every stride \\nthey climbed higher above the stenches of the unseen lair, and strength \\nreturned to limb and heart. But still the hatred of the Watcher lurked \\nbehind them, blind for a while, perhaps, but undefeated, still bent on \\ndeath. And now there came a flow of air to meet them, cold and thin. The \\nopening, the tunnel\\'s end, at last it was before them. Panting, yearning for \\na roofless place, they flung themselves forward, and then in amazement they \\nstaggered, tumbling back. The outlet was blocked with some barrier, but not \\nof stone: soft and a little yielding it seemed, and yet strong and \\nimpervious; air filtered through, hut not a glimmer of any light. Once more \\nthey charged and were hurled back. \\n\\nHolding aloft the Phial Frodo looked and before him he saw a greyness \\nwhich the radiance of the star -glass did not pierce and did not illuminate, \\nas if it were a shadow that being cast by no light, no light could \\ndissipate. Across the width and height of the tunnel a vast web was spun, \\norderly as the web of some huge spider, but denser-woven and far greater, \\nand each thread was as thick as rope. \\n\\nSam laughed grimly. \\'Cobwebs!\\' he said. \\'Is that all? Cobwebs! But \\nwhat a spider! Have at \\'em, down with \\'em! \\' \\n\\nIn a fury he hewed at them with his sword, but the thread that he \\nstruck did not break. It gave a little and then sprang back like a plucked \\nbowstring, turning the blade and tossing up both sword and arm. Three times \\nSam struck with all his force, and at last one single cord of all the \\ncountless cords snapped and twisted, curling and whipping through the air. \\nOne end of it lashed Sam\\'s hand, and he cried out in pain, starting back and \\ndrawing his hand across his mouth. \\n\\n\\'It will take days to clear the road like this,\\' he said. \\'What\\'s to be \\ndone? Have those eyes come back? \\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'No, not to be seen,\\' said Frodo. \\'But I still feel that they are \\nlooking at me, or thinking about me: making some other plan, perhaps. If \\nthis light were lowered, or if it failed, they would quickly come again.\\' \\n\\n\\'Trapped in the end! \\' said Sam bitterly, his anger rising again above \\nweariness and despair. \\'Gnats in a net. May the curse of Faramir bite that \\nGollum and bite him quick! \\' \\n\\n\\'That would not help us now,\\' said Frodo. \\'Come! Let us see what Sting \\ncan do. It is an elven-blade. There were webs of horror in the dark ravines \\nof Beleriand where it was forged. But you must be the guard and hold back \\nthe eyes. Here, take the star-glass. Do not be afraid. Hold it up and \\nwatch!\\' \\n\\nThen Frodo stepped up to the great grey net, and hewed it with a wide \\nsweeping stroke, drawing the bitter edge swiftly across a ladder of \\nclose-strung cords, and at once springing away. The blue-gleaming blade \\nshore through them like a scythe through grass, and they leaped and writhed \\nand then hung loose. A great rent was made. \\n\\nStroke after stroke he dealt, until at last all the web within his \\nreach was shattered, and the upper portion blew and swayed like a loose veil \\nin the incoming wind. The trap was broken. \\n\\n\\'Come! \\' cried Frodo. \\'On! On! \\' Wild joy at their escape from the very \\nmouth of despair suddenly filled all his mind. His head whirled as with a \\ndraught of potent wine. He sprang out, shouting as he came. \\n\\nIt seemed light in that dark land to his eyes that had passed through \\nthe den of night. The great smokes had risen and grown thinner, and the last \\nhours of a sombre day were passing; the red glare of Mordor had died away in \\nsullen gloom. Yet it seemed to Frodo that he looked upon a morning of sudden \\nhope. Almost he had reached the summit of the wall. Only a little higher \\nnow. The Cleft, Cirith Ungol, was before him, a dim notch in the black \\nridge, and the horns of rock darkling in the sky on either side. A short \\nrace, a sprinter\\'s course and he would be through! \\n\\n\\'The pass, Sam! \\' he cried, not heeding the shrillness of his voice, \\nthat released from the choking airs of the tunnel rang out now high and \\nwild. \\'The pass ! Run, run, and we\\'ll be through-through before any one can \\nstop us! \\' \\n\\nSam came up behind as fast as he could urge his legs; but glad as he \\nwas to be free, he was uneasy, and as he ran, he kept on glancing back at \\nthe dark arch of the tunnel, fearing to see eyes, or some shape beyond his \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nimagining, spring out in pursuit. Too little did he or his master know of \\nthe craft of Shelob. She had many exits from her lair. \\n\\nThere agelong she had dwelt, an evil thing in spider-form, even such as \\nonce of old had lived in the Land of the Elves in the West that is now under \\nthe Sea, such as Beren fought in the Mountains of Terror in Doriath, and so \\ncame to L(r)thien upon the green sward amid the hemlocks in the moonlight \\nlong \\n\\nago. How Shelob came there, flying from ruin, no tale tells, for out of the \\nDark Years few tales have come. But still she was there, who was there \\nbefore Sauron, and before the first stone of Barad-dyr; and she served none \\nbut herself, drinking the blood of Elves and Men, bloated and grown fat with \\nendless brooding on her feasts, weaving webs of shadow; for all living \\nthings were her food, and her vomit darkness. Far and wide her lesser \\nbroods, bastards of the miserable mates, her own offspring, that she slew, \\nspread from glen to glen, from the Ephel D(r)ath to the eastern hills, to Dol \\nGuldur and the fastnesses of Mirkwood. But none could rival her, Shelob the \\nGreat, last child of Ungoliant to trouble the unhappy world. \\n\\nAlready, years before, Gollum had beheld her, Smjagol who pried into \\nall dark holes, and in past days he had bowed and worshipped her, and the \\ndarkness of her evil will walked through all the ways of his weariness \\nbeside him, cutting him off from light and from regret. And he had promised \\nto bring her food. But her lust was not his lust. Little she knew of or \\ncared for towers, or rings, or anything devised by mind or hand, who only \\ndesired death for all others, mind and body, and for herself a glut of life, \\nalone, swollen till the mountains could no longer hold her up and the \\ndarkness could not contain her. \\n\\nBut that desire was yet far away, and long now had she been hungry, \\nlurking in her den, while the power of Sauron grew, and light and living \\nthings forsook his borders; and the city in the valley was dead, and no Elf \\nor Man came near, only the unhappy Ores. Poor food and wary. But she must \\neat, and however busily they delved new winding passages from the pass and \\nfrom their tower, ever she found some way to snare them. But she lusted for \\nsweeter meat. And Gollum had brought it to her. \\n\\n\\'We\\'ll see, we\\'ll see,\\' he said often to himself, when the evil mood \\nwas on him, as he walked the dangerous road from Emyn Muil to Morgul \\nVale, \\n\\n\\'we\\'ll see. It may well be, O yes, it may well be that when She throws away \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe bones and the empty garments, we shall find it, we shall get it, the \\nPrecious, a reward for poor Smjagol who brings nice food. And we\\'ll save the \\nPrecious, as we promised. O yes. And when we\\'ve got it safe, then She\\'ll \\nknow it, O yes, then we\\'ll pay Her back, my precious. Then we\\'ll pay \\neveryone back! \\' \\n\\nSo he thought in an inner chamber of his cunning, which he still hoped \\nto hide from her, even when he had come to her again and had bowed low \\nbefore her while his companions slept. \\n\\nAnd as for Sauron: he knew where she lurked. It pleased him that she \\nshould dwell there hungry but unabated in malice, a more sure watch upon \\nthat ancient path into his land than any other that his skill could have \\ndevised. And Ores, they were useful slaves, but he had them in plenty. If \\nnow and again Shelob caught them to stay her appetite, she was welcome: he \\ncould spare them. And sometimes as a man may cast a dainty to his cat ( his \\ncat he calls her, but she owns him not) Sauron would send her prisoners that \\nhe had no better uses for: he would have them driven to her hole, and report \\nbrought back to him of the play she made. \\n\\nSo they both lived, delighting in their own devices, and feared no \\nassault, nor wrath, nor any end of their wickedness. Never yet had any fly \\nescaped from Shelob\\'s webs, and the greater now was her rage and hunger. \\n\\nBut nothing of this evil which they had stirred up against them did \\npoor Sam know, except that a fear was growing on him, a menace which he \\ncould not see; and such a weight did it become that it was a burden to him \\nto run, and his feet seemed leaden. \\n\\nDread was round him, and enemies before him in the pass, and his master \\nwas in a fey mood running heedlessly to meet them. Turning his eyes away \\nfrom the shadow behind and the deep gloom beneath the cliff upon his left, \\nhe looked ahead, and he saw two things that increased his dismay. He saw \\nthat the sword which Frodo still held unsheathed was glittering with blue \\nflame; and he saw that though the sky behind was now dark, still the window \\nin the tower was glowing red. \\n\\n\\'Ores!\\' he muttered. \\'We\\'ll never rush it like this. There\\'s Ores \\nabout, and worse than Ores.\\' Then returning quickly to his long habit of \\nsecrecy, he closed his hand about the precious Phial which he still bore. \\n\\nRed with his own living blood his hand shone for a moment, and then he \\nthrust the revealing light deep into a pocket near his breast and drew his \\nelven-cloak about him. Now he tried to quicken his pace. His master was \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngaining on him; already he was some twenty strides ahead, flitting on like a \\nshadow; soon he would be lost to sight in that grey world. \\n\\nHardly had Sam hidden the light of the star-glass when she came. A \\nlittle way ahead and to his left he saw suddenly, issuing from a black hole \\nof shadow under the cliff, the most loathly shape that he had ever beheld, \\nhorrible beyond the horror of an evil dream. Most like a spider she was, but \\nhuger than the great hunting beasts, and more terrible than they because of \\nthe evil purpose in her remorseless eyes. Those same eyes that he had \\nthought daunted and defeated, there they were lit with a fell light again, \\nclustering in her out-thrust head. Great horns she had, and behind her short \\nstalk -like neck was her huge swollen body, a vast bloated bag, swaying and \\nsagging between her legs; its great bulk was black, blotched with livid \\nmarks, but the belly underneath was pale and luminous and gave forth a \\nstench. Her legs were bent, with great knobbed joints high above her back, \\nand hairs that stuck out like steel spines, and at each leg\\'s end there was \\na claw. \\n\\nAs soon as she had squeezed her soft squelching body and its folded \\nlimbs out of the upper exit from her lair, she moved with a horrible speed, \\nnow running on her creaking legs, now making a sudden bound. She was \\nbetween \\n\\nSam and his master. Either she did not see Sam, or she avoided him for the \\nmoment as the bearer of the light\\' and fixed all her intent upon one prey, \\nupon Frodo, bereft of his Phial, running heedless up the path, unaware yet \\nof his peril. Swiftly he ran, but Shelob was swifter; in a few leaps she \\nwould have him. \\n\\nSam gasped and gathered all his remaining breath to shout. \\'Look out \\nbehind! \\' he yelled. \\'Look out master! I\\'m\\' -- but suddenly his cry was \\nstifled. \\n\\nA long clammy hand went over his mouth and another caught him by the \\nneck, while something wrapped itself about his leg. Taken off his guard he \\ntoppled backwards into the arms of his attacker. \\n\\n\\'Got him! \\' hissed Gollum in his ear. \\'At last, my precious, we\\'ve got \\nhim, yes, the nassty hobbit. We takes this one. She\\'ll get the other. O yes, \\nShelob will get him, not Smjagol: he promised; he won\\'t hurt Master at all. \\nBut he\\'s got you, you nassty filthy little sneak!\\' He spat on Sam\\'s neck. \\n\\nFury at the treachery, and desperation at the delay when his master was \\nin deadly peril, gave to Sam a sudden violence and strength that was far \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbeyond anything that Gollum had expected from this slow stupid hobbit, as he \\nthought him. Not Gollum himself could have twisted more quickly or more \\nfiercely. His hold on Sam\\'s mouth slipped, and Sam ducked and lunged \\nforward \\n\\nagain, trying to tear away from the grip on his neck. His sword was still in \\nhis hand, and on his left arm, hanging by its thong, was Faramir\\'s staff. \\nDesperately he tried to turn and stab his enemy. But Gollum was too quick. \\nHis long right arm shot out, and he grabbed Sam\\'s wrist: his fingers were \\nlike a vice; slowly and relentlessly he bent the hand down and forward, till \\nwith a cry of pain Sam released the sword and it fell to the ground; and all \\nthe while Gollum\\'s other hand was tightening on Sam\\'s throat. \\n\\nThen Sam played his last trick. With all his strength he pulled away \\nand got his feet firmly planted; then suddenly he drove his legs against the \\nground and with his whole force hurled himself backwards. \\n\\nNot expecting even this simple trick from Sam, Gollum fell over with \\nSam on top, and he received the weight of the sturdy hobbit in his stomach. \\n\\nA sharp hiss came out of him, and for a second his hand upon Sam\\'s throat \\nloosened; but his fingers still gripped the sword-hand. Sam tore himself \\nforward and away, and stood up, and then quickly he wheeled away to his \\nright, pivoted on the wrist held by Gollum. Laying hold of the staff with \\nhis left hand, Sam swung it up, and down it came with a whistling crack on \\nGollum\\'s outstretched arm, just below the elbow. \\n\\nWith a squeal Gollum let go. Then Sam waded in; not waiting to change \\nthe staff from left to right he dealt another savage blow. Quick as a snake \\nGollum slithered aside, and the stroke aimed at his head fell across his \\nback. The staff cracked and broke. That was enough for him. Grabbing from \\nbehind was an old game of his, and seldom had he failed in it. But this \\ntime, misled by spite, he had made the mistake of speaking and gloating \\nbefore he had both hands on his victim\\'s neck. Everything had gone wrong \\nwith his beautiful plan, since that horrible light had so unexpectedly \\nappeared in the darkness. And now he was face to face with a furious enemy, \\nlittle less than his own size. This fight was not for him. Sam swept up his \\nsword from the ground and raised it. Gollum squealed, and springing aside on \\nto all fours, he jumped away in one big bound like a frog. Before Sam could \\nreach him, he was off, running with amazing speed back towards the tunnel. \\n\\nSword in hand Sam went after him. For the moment he had forgotten \\neverything else but the red fury in his brain and the desire to kill Gollum. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut before he could overtake him, Gollum was gone. Then as the dark hole \\nstood before him and the stench came out to meet him, like a clap of thunder \\nthe thought of Frodo and the monster smote upon Sam\\'s mind. He spun round, \\nand rushed wildly up the path, calling and calling his master\\'s name. He was \\ntoo late. So far Gollum\\'s plot had succeeded. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 10. The Choices of Master Samwise \\n\\n\\n\\nFrodo was lying face upward on the ground and the monster was bending \\nover him, so intent upon her victim that she took no heed of Sam and his \\ncries, until he was close at hand. As he rushed up he saw that Frodo was \\nalready bound in cords, wound about him from ankle to shoulder, and the \\nmonster with her great forelegs was beginning half to lift, half to drag his \\nbody away. \\n\\nOn the near side of him lay, gleaming on the ground, his elven-blade, \\nwhere it had fallen useless from his grasp. Sam did not wait to wonder what \\nwas to be done, or whether he was brave, or loyal, or filled with rage. He \\nsprang forward with a yell, and seized his master\\'s sword in his left hand. \\nThen he charged. No onslaught more fierce was ever seen in the savage world \\nof beasts; where some desperate small creature armed with little teeth \\nalone, will spring upon a tower of horn and hide that stands above its \\nfallen mate. \\n\\nDisturbed as if out of some gloating dream by his small yell she turned \\nslowly the dreadful malice of her glance upon him. But almost before she was \\naware that a fury was upon her greater than any she had known in countless \\nyears, the shining sword bit upon her foot and shore away the claw. Sam \\nsprang in, inside the arches of her legs, and with a quick upthrust of his \\nother hand stabbed at the clustered eyes upon her lowered head. One great \\neye went dark. \\n\\nNow the miserable creature was right under her, for the moment out of \\nthe reach of her sting and of her claws. Her vast belly was above him with \\nits putrid light, and the stench of it almost smote him down. Still his fury \\nheld for one more blow, and before she could sink upon him, smothering him \\nand all his little impudence of courage, he slashed the bright elven-blade \\nacross her with desperate strength. \\n\\nBut Shelob was not as dragons are, no softer spot had she save only her \\neyes. Knobbed and pitted with corruption was her age-old hide, but ever \\nthickened from within with layer on layer of evil growth. The blade scored \\nit with a dreadful gash, but those hideous folds could not be pierced by any \\nstrength of men, not though Elf or Dwarf should forge the steel or the hand \\nof Beren or of T(r)rin wield it. She yielded to the stroke, and then heaved up \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe great bag of her belly high above Sam\\'s head. Poison frothed and bubbled \\nfrom the wound. Now splaying her legs she drove her huge bulk down on \\nhim \\n\\nagain. Too soon. For Sam still stood upon his feet, and dropping his own \\nsword, with both hands he held the elven-blade point upwards, fending off \\nthat ghastly roof; and so Shelob, with the driving force of her own cruel \\nwill, with strength greater than any warrior\\'s hand, thrust herself upon a \\nbitter spike. Deep, deep it pricked, as Sam was crushed slowly to the \\nground. \\n\\nNo such anguish had Shelob ever known, or dreamed of knowing, in all \\nher long world of wickedness. Not the doughtiest soldier of old Gondor, nor \\nthe most savage Ore entrapped, had ever thus endured her, or set blade to \\nher beloved flesh. A shudder went through her. Heaving up again, wrenching \\naway from the pain, she bent her writhing limbs beneath her and sprang \\nbackwards in a convulsive leap. \\n\\nSam had fallen to his knees by Frodo\\'s head, his senses reeling in the \\nfoul stench, his two hands still gripping the hilt of the sword. Through the \\nmist before his eyes he was aware dimly of Frodo\\'s face and stubbornly he \\nfought to master himself and to drag himself out of the swoon that was upon \\nhim. Slowly he raised his head and saw her, only a few paces away, eyeing \\nhim, her beak drabbling a spittle of venom, and a green ooze trickling from \\nbelow her wounded eye. There she crouched, her shuddering belly splayed \\nupon \\n\\nthe ground, the great bows of her legs quivering, as she gathered herself \\nfor another spring-this time to crush and sting to death: no little bite of \\npoison to still the struggling of her meat; this time to slay and then to \\nrend. \\n\\nEven as Sam himself crouched, looking at her, seeing his death in her \\neyes, a thought came to him, as if some remote voice had spoken, and he \\nfumbled in his breast with his left hand, and found what he sought: cold and \\nhard and solid it seemed to his touch in a phantom world of horror, the \\nPhial of Galadriel. \\n\\n\\'Galadriel! \\' he said faintly, and then he heard voices far off but \\nclear: the crying of the Elves as they walked under the stars in the beloved \\nshadows of the Shire, and the music of the Elves as it came through his \\nsleep in the Hall of Fire in the house of Elrond. \\n\\nGilthoniel A Elberethl \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd then his tongue was loosed and his voice cried in a language which \\nhe did not know: \\n\\nA Elbereth Gilthoniel \\n\\no menel palan-diriel, \\n\\nle nallon sn di\\'nguruthos! \\n\\nA tiro nin, Fanuilos! \\n\\nAnd with that he staggered to his feet and was Sam wise the hobbit, \\nHamfast\\'s son, again. \\n\\n\\'Now come, you filth!\\' he cried. \\'You\\'ve hurt my master, you brute, and \\nyou\\'ll pay for it. We\\'re going on; but we\\'ll settle with you first. Come on, \\nand taste it again!\\' \\n\\nAs if his indomitable spirit had set its potency in motion, the glass \\nblazed suddenly like a white torch in his hand. It flamed like a star that \\nleaping from the firmament sears the dark air with intolerable light. No \\nsuch terror out of heaven had ever burned in Shelob\\'s face before. The beams \\nof it entered into her wounded head and scored it with unbearable pain, and \\nthe dreadful infection of light spread from eye to eye. She fell back \\nbeating the air with her forelegs, her sight blasted by inner lightnings, \\nher mind in agony. Then turning her maimed head away, she rolled aside and \\nbegan to crawl, claw by claw, towards the opening in the dark cliff behind. \\n\\nSam came on. He was reeling like a drunken man, but he came on. And \\nShelob cowed at last, shrunken in defeat, jerked and quivered as she tried \\nto hasten from him. She reached the hole, and squeezing down, leaving a \\ntrail of green-yellow slime, she slipped in, even as Sam hewed a last stroke \\nat her dragging legs. Then he fell to the ground. \\n\\nShelob was gone; and whether she lay long in her lair, nursing her \\nmalice and her misery, and in slow years of darkness healed herself from \\nwithin, rebuilding her clustered eyes, until with hunger like death she spun \\nonce more her dreadful snares in the glens of the Mountains of Shadow, this \\ntale does not tell. \\n\\nSam was left alone. Wearily, as the evening of the Nameless Land fell \\nupon the place of battle, he crawled back to his master. \\n\\n\\'Master, dear master,\\' he said, but Frodo did not speak. As he had run \\nforward, eager, rejoicing to be free, Shelob with hideous speed had come \\nbehind and with one swift stroke had stung him in the neck. He lay now pale, \\nand heard no voice, and did not move. \\n\\n\\'Master, dear master! \\' said Sam, and through a long silence waited. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nlistening in vain. \\n\\nThen as quickly as he could he cut away the binding cords and laid his \\nhead upon Frodo\\'s breast and to his mouth, but no stir of life could he \\nfind, nor feel the faintest flutter of the heart. Often he chafed his \\nmaster\\'s hands and feet, and touched his brow, but all were cold. \\n\\n\\'Frodo, Mr. Frodo! \\' he called. \\'Don\\'t leave me here alone! It\\'s your \\nSam calling. Don\\'t go where I can\\'t follow! Wake up, Mr. Frodo! O wake up, \\nFrodo, me dear, me dear. Wake up!\\' \\n\\nThen anger surged over hint, and he ran about his master\\'s body in a \\nrage, stabbing the air, and smiting the stones, and shouting challenges. \\nPresently he came back, and bending looked at Frodo\\'s face, pale beneath him \\nin the dusk. And suddenly he saw that he was in the picture that was \\nrevealed to him in the mirror of Galadriel in Lurien: Frodo with a pale face \\nlying fast asleep under a great dark cliff. Or fast asleep he had thought \\nthen. \\'He\\'s dead! \\' he said. \\'Not asleep, dead! \\' And as he said it, as if \\nthe words had set the venom to its work again, it seemed to him that the hue \\nof the face grew livid green. \\n\\nAnd then black despair came down on him, and Sam bowed to the ground, \\nand drew his grey hood over his head, and night came into his heart, and he \\nknew no more. \\n\\nWhen at last the blackness passed, Sam looked up and shadows were about \\nhim; but for how many minutes or hours the world had gone dragging on he \\ncould not tell. He was still in the same place, and still his master lay \\nbeside him dead. The mountains had not crumbled nor the earth fallen into \\nruin. \\n\\n\\'What shall I do, what shall I do? \\' he said. \\'Did I come all this way \\nwith him for nothing? \\' And then he remembered his own voice speaking \\nwords \\n\\nthat at the time he did not understand himself, at the beginning of their \\njourney: I have something to do before the end. I must see it through, sir, \\nif you understand. \\n\\n\\'But what can I do? Not leave Mr. Frodo dead, unburied on the top of \\nthe mountains, and go home? Or go on? Go on?\\' he repeated, and for a \\nmoment \\n\\ndoubt and fear shook him. \\'Go on? Is that what I\\'ve got to do? And leave \\nhim?\\' \\n\\nThen at last he began to weep; and going to Frodo he composed his body, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand folded his cold hands upon his breast, and wrapped his cloak about him; \\nand he laid his own sword at one side, and the staff that Faramir had given \\nat the other. \\n\\n\\'If I\\'m to go on,\\' he said, \\'then I must take your sword, by your \\nleave, Mr. Frodo, but I\\'ll put this one to lie by you, as it lay by the old \\nking in the barrow; and you\\'ve got your beautiful mithril coat from old Mr. \\nBilbo. And your star-glass, Mr. Frodo, you did lend it to me and I\\'ll need \\nit, for I\\'ll be always in the dark now. It\\'s too good for me, and the Lady \\ngave it to you, but maybe she\\'d understand. Do you understand, Mr. Frodo? \\nI\\'ve got to go on.\\' \\n\\nBut he could not go, not yet. He knelt and held Frodo\\'s hand and could \\nnot release it. And time went by and still he knelt, holding his master\\'s \\nhand, and in his heart keeping a debate. \\n\\nNow he tried to find strength to tear himself away and go on a lonely \\njourney -- for vengeance. If once he could go, his anger would bear him down \\nall the roads of the world, pursuing, until he had him at last: Gollum. Then \\nGollum would die in a corner. But that was not what he had set out to do. It \\nwould not be worth while to leave his master for that. It would not bring \\nhim back. Nothing would. They had better both be dead together. And that too \\nwould be a lonely journey. \\n\\nHe looked on the bright point of the sword. He thought of the places \\nbehind where there was a black brink and an empty fall into nothingness. \\nThere was no escape that way. That was to do nothing, not even to grieve. \\nThat was not what he had set out to do. \\'What am I to do then? \\' he cried \\nagain, and now he seemed plainly to know the hard answer: see it through. \\nAnother lonely journey, and the worst. \\n\\n\\'What? Me, alone, go to the Crack of Doom and all? \\' He quailed still, \\nbut the resolve grew. \\'What? Me take the Ring from him ? The Council gave it \\nto him.\\' \\n\\nBut the answer came at once: \\'And the Council gave him companions, so \\nthat the errand should not fail. And you are the last of all the Company. \\n\\nThe errand must not fail.\\' \\n\\n\\'I wish I wasn\\'t the last,\\' he groaned. \\'I wish old Gandalf was hare or \\nsomebody. Why am I left all alone to make up my mind? I\\'m sure to go wrong. \\nAnd it\\'s not for me to go taking the Ring, putting myself forward.\\' \\n\\n\\'But you haven\\'t put yourself forward; you\\'ve been put forward. And as \\nfor not being the right and proper person, why, Mr. Frodo wasn\\'t as you \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmight say, nor Mr. Bilbo. They didn\\'t choose themselves.\\' \\n\\n\\'Ah well, I must make up my own mind. I will make it up. But I\\'ll be \\nsure to go wrong: that\\'d be Sam Gamgee all over. \\n\\n\\'Let me see now: if we\\'re found here, or Mr. Frodo\\'s found, and that \\nThing\\'s on him, well, the Enemy will get it. And that\\'s the end of all of \\nus, of Lorien, and Rivendell, and the Shire and all. And there s no time to \\nlose, or it\\'ll be the end anyway. The war\\'s begun, and more than likely \\nthings are all going the Enemy\\'s way already. No chance to go back with It \\nand get advice or permission. No, it\\'s sit here till they come and kill me \\nover master\\'s body, and gets It: or take It and go.\\' He drew a deep breath. \\n\\n\\'Then take It, it is ! \\' \\n\\nHe stooped. Very gently he undid the clasp at the neck and slipped his \\nhand inside Frodo\\'s tunic; then with his other hand raising the head, he \\nkissed the cold forehead, and softly drew the chain over it. And then the \\nhead lay quietly back again in rest. No change came over the still face, and \\nby that more than by all other tokens Sam was convinced at last that Frodo \\nhad died and laid aside the Quest. \\n\\n\\'Good-bye, master, my dear! \\' he murmured. \\'Forgive your Sam. He\\'ll \\ncome back to this spot when the job\\'s done -- if he manages it. And then \\nhe\\'ll not leave you again. Rest you quiet till I come; and may no foul \\ncreature come anigh you ! And if the Lady could hear me and give me one wish, \\nI would wish to come back and find you again. Good-bye! \\' \\n\\nAnd then he bent his own neck and put the chain upon it, and at once \\nhis head was bowed to the ground with the weight of the Ring, as if a great \\nstone had been strung on him. But slowly, as if the weight became less, or \\nnew strength grew in him, he raised his head, and then with a great effort \\ngot to his feet and found that he could walk and bear his burden. And for a \\nmoment he lifted up the Phial and looked down at his master, and the light \\nburned gently now with the soft radiance of the evening-star in summer, and \\nin that light Frodo\\'s face was fair of hue again, pale but beautiful with an \\nelvish beauty, as of one who has long passed the shadows. And with the \\nbitter comfort of that last sight Sam turned and hid the light and stumbled \\non into the growing dark. \\n\\nHe had not far to go. The tunnel was some way behind; the Cleft a \\ncouple of hundred yards ahead, or less. The path was visible in the dusk\\' a \\ndeep rut worn in ages of passage, running now gently up in a long trough \\nwith cliffs on either side. The trough narrowed rapidly. Soon Sam came to a \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nlong flight of broad shallow steps. Now the ore-tower was right above him, \\nfrowning black, and in it the red eye glowed. Now he was hidden in the dark \\nshadow under it. He was coming to the top of the steps and was in the Cleft \\nat last. \\n\\n\\'I\\'ve made up my mind,\\' he kept saying to himself. But he had not. \\nThough he had done his best to think it out, what he was doing was \\naltogether against the grain of his nature. \\'Have I got it wrong? \\' he \\nmuttered. \\'What ought I to have done? \\' \\n\\nAs the sheer sides of the Cleft closed about him, before he reached the \\nactual summit, before he looked at last on the path descending into the \\nNameless Land, he turned. For a moment, motionless in intolerable doubt, he \\nlooked back. He could still see, like a small blot in the gathering gloom, \\nthe mouth of the tunnel; and he thought he could see or guess where Frodo \\nlay. He fancied there was a glimmer on the ground down there, or perhaps it \\nwas some trick of his tears, as he peered out at that high stony place where \\nall his life had fallen in ruin. \\n\\n\\'If only I could have my wish, my one wish,\\' he sighed, \\'to go back and \\nfind him!\\' Then at last he turned to the road in front and took a few \\nsteps: the heaviest and the most reluctant he had ever taken. \\n\\nOnly a few steps; and now only a few more and he would be going down \\nand would never see that high place again. And then suddenly he heard cries \\nand voices. He stood still as stone. Ore- voices. They were behind him and \\nbefore him. A noise of tramping feet and harsh shouts: Ores were coming up \\nto the Cleft from the far side, from some entry to the tower, perhaps. \\nTramping feet and shouts behind. He wheeled round. He saw small red lights, \\ntorches, winking away below there as they issued from the tunnel. At last \\nthe hunt was up. The red eye of the tower had not been blind. He was caught. \\n\\nNow the flicker of approaching torches and the clink of steel ahead was \\nvery near. In a minute they would reach the top and be on him. He had taken \\ntoo long in making up his mind, and now it was no good. How could he escape, \\nor save himself, or save the Ring? The Ring. He was not aware of any thought \\nor decision. He simply found himself drawing out the chain and taking the \\nRing in his hand. The head of the ore-company appeared in the Cleft right \\nbefore him. Then he put it on. \\n\\nThe world changed, and a single moment of time was filled with an hour \\nof thought. At once he was aware that hearing was sharpened while sight was \\ndimmed, but otherwise than in Shelob\\'s lair. All things about him now were \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnot dark but vague; while he himself was there in a grey hazy world, alone, \\nlike a small black solid rock and the Ring, weighing down his left hand, was \\nlike an orb of hot gold. He did not feel invisible at all, but horribly and \\nuniquely visible; and he knew that somewhere an Eye was searching for him. \\n\\nHe heard the crack of stone, and the murmur of water far off in Morgul \\nVale; and down away under the rock the bubbling misery of Shelob, groping, \\nlost in some blind passage; and voices in the dungeons of the tower; and the \\ncries of the Ores as they came out of the tunnel; and deafening, roaring in \\nhis ears, the crash of the feet and the rending clamour of the Ores before \\nhim. He shrank against the cliff. But they marched up like a phantom \\ncompany, grey distorted figures in a mist, only dreams of fear with pale \\nflames in their hands. And they passed him by. He cowered, trying to creep \\naway into some cranny and to hide. \\n\\nHe listened. The Ores from the tunnel and the others marching down had \\nsighted one another, and both parties were now hurrying and shouting. He \\nheard them both clearly, and he understood what they said. Perhaps the Ring \\ngave understanding of tongues, or simply understanding, especially of the \\nservants of Sauron its maker, so that if he gave heed, he understood and \\ntranslated the thought to himself. Certainly the Ring had grown greatly in \\npower as it approached the places of its forging; but one thing it did not \\nconfer, and that was courage. At present Sam still thought only of hiding, \\nof lying low till all was quiet again; and he listened anxiously. He could \\nnot tell how near the voices were, the words seemed almost in his ears. \\n\\n\\'Hola! Gorbag! What are you doing up here? Had enough of war already? \\' \\n\\n\\'Orders, you lubber. And what are you doing, Shagrat? Tired of lurking \\nup there? Thinking of coming down to fight? \\' \\n\\n\\'Orders to you. I\\'m in command of this pass. So speak civil. What\\'s \\nyour report? \\' \\n\\n\\'Nothing.\\' \\n\\n\\'Hai! hai! yoi !\\' A yell broke into the exchanges of the leaders. The \\nOres lower down had suddenly seen something. They began to run. So did the \\nothers. \\n\\n\\'Hai! Hola! Here\\'s something! Lying right in the road. A spy, a spy! \\' \\n\\nThere was a hoot of snarling horns and a babel of baying voices. \\n\\nWith a dreadful stroke Sam was wakened from his cowering mood. They \\nhad \\n\\nseen his master. What would they do? He had heard tales of the Ores to make \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe blood run cold. It could not be borne. He sprang up. He flung the Quest \\nand all his decisions away, and fear and doubt with them. He knew now where \\nhis place was and had been: at his master\\'s side, though what he could do \\nthere was not clear. Back he ran down the steps, down the path towards \\nFrodo. \\n\\n\\'How many are there?\\' he thought. \\'Thirty or forty from the tower at \\nleast, and a lot more than that from down below, I guess. How many can I \\nkill before they get me? They\\'ll see the flame of the sword, as soon as I \\ndraw it, and they\\'ll get me sooner or later. I wonder if any song will ever \\nmention it: How Samwise fell in the High Pass and made a wall of bodies \\nround his master. No, no song. Of course not, for the Ring\\'ll be found, and \\nthere\\'ll be no more songs. I can\\'t help it. My place is by Mr. Frodo. They \\nmust understand that -- Elrond and the Council, and the great Lords and \\nLadies with all their wisdom. Their plans have gone wrong. I can\\'t be their \\nRing-bearer. Not without Mr. Frodo.\\' \\n\\nBut the Ores were out of his dim sight now. He had had no time to \\nconsider himself, but now he realized that he was weary, weary almost to \\nexhaustion: his legs would not carry him as he wished. He was too slow. The \\npath seemed miles long. Where had they all got to in the mist? \\n\\nThere they were again! A good way ahead still. A cluster of figures \\nround something lying on the ground; a few seemed to be darting this way and \\nthat, bent like dogs on a trail. He tried to make a spurt. \\n\\n\\'Come on, Sam! \\' he said, \\'or you\\'ll be too late again.\\' He loosened \\nthe sword in its sheath. In a minute he would draw it, and then-- \\n\\nThere was a wild clamour, hooting and laughing, as something was lifted \\nfrom the ground. \\'Ya hoi! Ya harri hoi! Up! Up! \\' \\n\\nThen a voice shouted: \\'Now off! The quick way. Back to the Undergate! \\nShe\\'ll not trouble us tonight by all the signs.\\' The whole band of \\nore-figures began to move. Four in the middle were carrying a body high on \\ntheir shoulders. \\'Ya hoi! \\' \\n\\nThey had taken Frodo\\'s body. They were off. He could not catch them up. \\nStill he laboured on. The Ores reached the tunnel and were passing in. Those \\nwith the burden went first, and behind them there was a good deal of \\nstruggling and jostling. Sam came on. He drew the sword, a flicker of blue \\nin his wavering hand, but they did not see it. Even as he came panting up, \\nthe last of them vanished into the black hole. \\n\\nFor a moment he stood, gasping, clutching his breast. Then he drew his \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsleeve across his face, wiping away the grime, and sweat, and tears. \\'Curse \\nthe filth! \\' he said, and sprang after them into the darkness. \\n\\nIt no longer seemed very dark to him in the tunnel, rather it was as if \\nhe had stepped out of a thin mist into a heavier fog. His weariness was \\ngrowing but his will hardened all the more. He thought he could see the \\nlight of torches a little way ahead, but try as he would, he could not catch \\nthem up. Ores go fast in tunnels, and this tunnel they knew well.; for in \\nspite of Shelob they were forced to use it often as the swiftest way from \\nthe Dead City over the mountains. In what far-off time the main tunnel and \\nthe great round pit had been made, where Shelob had taken up her abode in \\nages past, they did not know: but many byways they had themselves delved \\nabout in on either side, so as to escape the lair in their goings to and fro \\non the business of their masters. Tonight they did not intend to go far \\ndown, but were hastening to find a side-passage that led back to their \\nwatch-tower on the cliff. Must of them were gleeful, delighted with what \\nthey had found and seen, and as they ran they gabbled and yammered after the \\nfashion of their kind. Sam heard the noise of their harsh voices, flat and \\nhard in the dead air, and he could distinguish two voices from among all the \\nrest: they were louder, and nearer to him. The captains of the two parties \\nseemed to be bringing up the rear, debating as they went. \\n\\n\\'Can\\'t you stop your rabble making such a racket, Shagrat? \\' grunted \\nthe one. \\'We don\\'t want Shelob on us.\\' \\n\\n\\'Go on, Gorbag! Yours are making more than half the noise,\\' said the \\nother. \\'But let the lads play! No need to worry about Shelob for a bit, I \\nreckon. She\\'s sat on a nail, it seems, and we shan\\'t cry about that. Didn\\'t \\nyou see: a nasty mess all the way back to that cursed crack of hers? If \\nwe\\'ve stopped it once, we\\'ve stopped it a hundred times. So let \\'em laugh. \\nAnd we\\'ve struck a bit of luck at last: got something that Lugb(r)rz wants.\\' \\n\\'Lugb(r)rz wants it, eh? What is it, d\\'you think? Elvish it looked to me, \\nbut undersized. What\\'s the danger in a thing like that? \\' \\n\\n\\'Don\\'t know till we\\'ve had a look.\\' \\n\\n\\'Oho! So they haven\\'t told you what to expect? They don\\'t tell us all \\nthey know, do they? Not by half. But they can make mistakes, even the Top \\nOnes can.\\' \\n\\n\\'Sh, Gorbag!\\' Shagrat\\'s voice was lowered, so that even with his \\nstrangely sharpened hearing Sam could only just catch what was said. \\'They \\nmay, but they\\'ve got eyes and ears everywhere; some among my lot, as like as \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnot. But there\\'s no doubt about it, they\\'re troubled about something. The \\nNazgyl down below are, by your account; and Lugb(r)rz is too. Something \\nnearly \\nslipped.\\' \\n\\n\\'Nearly, you say! \\' said Gorbag. \\n\\n\\'All right,\\' said Shagrat, \\'but we\\'ll talk of that later: Wait till we \\nget to the Under-way. There\\'s a place there where we can talk a bit, while \\nthe lads go on.\\' \\n\\nShortly afterwards Sam saw the torches disappear. Then there was a \\nrumbling noise, and just as he hurried up, a bump. As far as he could guess \\nthe Ores had turned and gone into the very opening which Frodo and he had \\ntried and found blocked. It was still blocked. \\n\\nThere seemed to be a great stone in the way, but the Ores had got \\nthrough somehow, for he could hear their voices on the other side. They were \\nstill running along, deeper and deeper into the mountain, back towards the \\ntower. Sam felt desperate. They were carrying off his master\\'s body for some \\nfoul purpose and he could not follow. He thrust and pushed at the block, and \\nhe threw himself against it, but it did not yield. Then not far inside, or \\nso he thought, he heard the two captains\\' voices talking again. He stood \\nstill listening for a little hoping perhaps to learn something useful. \\n\\nPerhaps Gorbag, who seemed to belong to Minas Morgul, would come out, and \\nhe \\n\\ncould then slip in. \\n\\n\\'No, I don\\'t know,\\' said Gorbag\\'s voice. \\'The messages go through \\nquicker than anything could fly, as a rule. But I don\\'t enquire how it\\'s \\ndone. Safest not to. Grr! Those Nazgyl give me the creeps. And they skin the \\nbody off you as soon as look at you, and leave you all cold in the dark on \\nthe other side. But He likes \\'em; they\\'re His favourites nowadays, so it\\'s \\nno use grumbling. I tell you, it\\'s no game serving down in the city.\\' \\n\\n\\'You should try being up here with Shelob for company,\\' said Shagrat. \\n\\n\\'I\\'d like to try somewhere where there\\'s none of \\'em. But the war\\'s on \\nnow, and when that\\'s over things may be easier.\\' \\n\\n\\'It\\'s going well, they say.\\' \\n\\n\\'They would.\\' grunted Gorbag. \\'We\\'ll see. But anyway, if it does go \\nwell, there should be a lot more room. What d\\'you say? -- if we get a \\nchance, you and me\\'ll slip off and set up somewhere on our own with a few \\ntrusty lads, somewhere where there\\'s good loot nice and handy, and no big \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbosses.\\' \\n\\n\\'Ah! \\' said Shagrat. \\'Like old times.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Gorbag. \\'But don\\'t count on it. I\\'m not easy in my mind. As \\nI said, the Big Bosses, ay,\\' his voice sank almost to a whisper, \\'ay, even \\nthe Biggest, can make mistakes. Something nearly slipped you say. I say, \\nsomething has slipped. And we\\'ve got to look out. Always the poor Uruks to \\nput slips right, and small thanks. But don\\'t forget: the enemies don\\'t love \\nus any more than they love Him, and if they get topsides on Him, we\\'re done \\ntoo. But see here: when were you ordered out? \\' \\n\\n\\'About an hour ago, just before you saw us. A message came: Nazgyl \\nuneasy. Spies feared on Stairs. Double vigilance. Patrol to head of Stairs. \\n\\nI came at once.\\' \\n\\n\\'Bad business,\\' said Gorbag. \\'See here -- our Silent Watchers were \\nuneasy more than two days ago. that I know. But my patrol wasn\\'t ordered out \\nfor another day, nor any message sent to Lugb(r)rz either: owing to the Great \\nSignal going up, and the High Nazgyl going off to the war, and all that. And \\nthen they couldn\\'t get Lugb(r)rz to pay attention for a good while, I\\'m told.\\' \\n\\n\\'The Eye was busy elsewhere, I suppose,\\' said Shagrat. \\'Big things \\ngoing on away west, they say.\\' \\n\\n\\'I daresay,\\' growled Gorbag. \\'But in the meantime enemies have got up \\nthe Stairs. And what were you up to? You\\'re supposed to keep watch, aren\\'t \\nyou, special orders or no? What are you for?\\' \\n\\n\\'That\\'s enough! Don\\'t try and teach me my job. We were awake all right. \\n\\nWe knew there were funny things going on.\\' \\n\\n\\'Very funny! \\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, very funny: lights and shouting and all. But Shelob was on the \\ngo. My lads saw her and her Sneak.\\' \\n\\n\\'Her Sneak? What\\'s that? \\' \\n\\n\\'You must have seen him: little thin black fellow; like a spider \\nhimself, or perhaps more like a starved frog. He\\'s been here before. Came \\nout of Lugb(r)rz the first time, years ago, and we had word from High Up to \\nlet him pass. He\\'s been up the Stairs once or twice since then, but we\\'ve \\nleft him alone: seems to have some understanding with Her Ladyship. I \\nsuppose he\\'s no good to eat: she wouldn\\'t worry about words from High Up. \\nBut a fine guard you keep in the valley: he was up here a day before all \\nthis racket. Early last night we saw him. Anyway my lads reported that Her \\nLadyship was having some fun, and that seemed good enough for me, until the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmessage came. I thought her Sneak had brought her a toy. or that you\\'d \\nperhaps sent her a present, a prisoner of war or something. I don\\'t \\ninterfere when she\\'s playing. Nothing gets by Shelob when she\\'s on the \\nhunt.\\' \\n\\n\\'Nothing, say you! Didn\\'t you use your eyes back there? I tell you I\\'m \\nnot easy in my mind. Whatever came up the Stairs, did get by. It cut her web \\nand got clean out of the hole. That\\'s something to think about! \\' \\n\\n\\'Ah well, but she got him in the end, didn\\'t she? \\' \\n\\n\\' Got him? Got whol This little fellow? But if he was the only one then \\nshe\\'d have had him off to her larder long before, and there he\\'d be now. And \\nif Lugb(r)rz wanted him, you\\'d have to go and get him. Nice for you. But there \\nwas more than one.\\' \\n\\nAt this point Sam began to listen more attentively and pressed his ear \\nagainst the stone. \\n\\n\\'Who cut the cords she\\'d put round him, Shagrat? Same one as cut the \\nweb. Didn\\'t you see that? And who stuck a pin into Her Ladyship? Same one, I \\nreckon. And where is he? Where is he, Shagrat? \\' \\n\\nShagrat made no reply. \\n\\n\\'You may well put your thinking cap on, if you\\'ve got one. It\\'s no \\nlaughing matter. No one, no one has ever stuck a pin in Shelob before, as \\nyou should know well enough. There\\'s no grief in that; but think -there\\'s \\nsomeone loose hereabouts as is more dangerous than any other damned rebel \\nthat ever walked since the bad old times, since the Great Siege. Something \\nhas slipped.\\' \\n\\n\\'And what is it then? \\' growled Shagrat. \\n\\n\\'By all the signs, Captain Shagrat, I\\'d say there\\'s a large warrior \\nloose, Elf most likely, with an elf-sword anyway, and an axe as well maybe: \\nand he\\'s loose in your bounds, too, and you\\'ve never spotted him. Very funny \\nindeed! \\' Gorbag spat. Sam smiled grimly at this description of himself. \\n\\n\\'Ah well, you always did take a gloomy view.\\' said Shagrat. \\'You can \\nread the signs how you like, but there may be other ways to explain them. \\nAnyhow. I\\'ve got watchers at every point, and I\\'m going to deal with one \\nthing at a time. When I\\'ve had a look at the fellow we have caught, then \\nI\\'ll begin to worry \\n\\n\\n\\nlcb2 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nabout something else.\\' \\n\\nIt s my guess you won\\'t find much in that little fellow,\\' said Gorbag. \\n\\n\\'He may have had nothing to do with the real mischief. The big fellow with \\nthe sharp sword doesn\\'t seem to have thought him worth much anyhow -- just \\nleft him lying: regular elvish trick.\\' \\n\\n\\'We\\'ll see. Come on now! We\\'ve talked enough. Let\\'s go and have a look \\nat the prisoner! \\n\\n\\'What are you going to do with him? Don\\'t forget I spotted him first. \\n\\nIf there\\'s any game, me and my lads must be in it.\\' \\n\\n\\'Now, now,\\' growled Shagrat. \\'I have my orders. And it\\'s more than my \\nbelly\\'s worth, or yours, to break \\'em. Any trespasser found by the guard is \\nto be held at the tower. Prisoner is to be stripped. Full description of \\nevery article, garment, weapon, letter, ring, or trinket is to be sent to \\nLugb(r)rz at once, and to Lugb(r)rz only. And the prisoner is to be kept safe \\nand intact, under pain of death for every member of the guard, until He \\nsends or comes Himself. That\\'s plain enough, and that\\'s what I\\'m going to \\ndo.\\' \\n\\n\\'Stripped, eh? \\' said Gorbag. \\'What, teeth, nails, hair, and all? \\' \\n\\n\\'No, none of that. He\\'s for Lugb(r)rz, I tell you. He\\'s wanted safe and \\nwhole.\\' \\n\\n\\'You\\'ll find that difficult,\\' laughed Gorbag. \\'He\\'s nothing but carrion \\nnow. What Lugb(r)rz will do with such stuff I can\\'t guess. He might as well go \\nin the pot.\\' \\n\\n\\'You fool,\\' snarled Shagrat. \\'You\\'ve been talking very clever, but \\nthere\\'s a lot you don\\'t know, though most other folk do. You\\'ll be for the \\npot or for Shelob, if you don\\'t take care. Carrion! Is that all you know of \\nHer Ladyship? When she binds with cords, she\\'s after meat. She doesn\\'t eat \\ndead meat, nor suck cold blood. This fellow isn\\'t dead! \\' \\n\\nSam reeled, clutching at the stone. He felt as if the whole dark world \\nwas turning upside down. So great was the shock that he almost swooned, but \\neven as he fought to keep a hold on his senses, deep inside him he was aware \\nof the comment: \\'You fool, he isn\\'t dead, and your heart knew it. Don\\'t \\ntrust your head, Samwise, it is not the best part of you. The trouble with \\nyou is that you never really had any hope. Now what is to be done? \\' Fur the \\nmoment nothing, but to prop himself against the unmoving stone and listen, \\nlisten to the vile ore- voices. \\n\\n\\'Garn!\\' said Shagrat. \\'She\\'s got more than one poison. When she\\'s \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhunting, she just gives \\'em a dab in the neck and they go as limp as boned \\nfish, and then she has her way with them. D\\'you remember old Ufthak? We lost \\nhim for days. Then we found him in a corner; hanging up he was, but he was \\nwide awake and glaring. How we laughed! She\\'d forgotten him, maybe, but \\nwe \\n\\ndidn\\'t touch him-no good interfering with Her. Nar -- this little filth, \\nhe\\'ll wake up, in a few hours; and beyond feeling a bit sick for a hit, \\nhe\\'ll be all right. Or would be, if Lugb(r)rz would let him alone. And of \\ncourse, beyond wondering where he is and what\\'s happened to him.\\' \\n\\n\\'And what\\'s going to happen to him,\\' laughed Gorbag. \\'We can tell him a \\nfew stories at any rate, if we can\\'t do anything else. I don\\'t suppose he\\'s \\never been in lovely Lugb(r)rz, so he may like to know what to expect. This is \\ngoing to be more funny than I thought. Let\\'s go!\\' \\n\\n\\'There\\'s going to be no fun, I tell you,\\' said Shagrat. \\'And he\\'s got \\nto be kept safe, or we\\'re all as good as dead.\\' \\n\\n\\'All right! But if I were you, I\\'d catch the big one that\\'s loose, \\nbefore you send in any report to Lugb(r)rz. It won\\'t sound too pretty to say \\nyou\\'ve caught the kitten and let the cat escape.\\' \\n\\nThe voices began to move away. Sam heard the sound of feet receding. He \\nwas recovering from his shock, and now a wild fury was on him. \\'I got it all \\nwrong! \\' he cried. \\'I knew I would. Now they\\'ve got him, the devils! the \\nfilth! Never leave your master, never, never: that was my right rule. And I \\nknew it in my heart. May I be forgiven! Now I\\'ve got to get back to him. \\nSomehow, somehow! \\' \\n\\nHe drew his sword again and beat on the stone with the hilt, but it \\nonly gave out a dull sound. The sword, however, blazed so brightly now that \\nhe could see dimly in its light. To his surprise he noticed that the great \\nblock was shaped like a heavy door, and was less than twice his own height. \\nAbove it was a dark blank space between the top and the low arch of the \\nopening. It was probably only meant to be a stop against the intrusion of \\nShelob, fastened on the inside with some latch or bolt beyond the reach of \\nher cunning. With his remaining strength Sam leaped and caught the top, \\nscrambled up, and dropped; and then he ran madly, sword blazing in hand, \\nround a bend and up a winding tunnel. \\n\\nThe news that his master was still alive roused him to a last effort \\nbeyond thought of weariness. He could not see anything ahead, for this new \\npassage twisted and turned constantly; but he thought he was catching the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntwo Ores up: their voices were growing nearer again. Now they seemed quite \\nclose. \\n\\n\\'That\\'s what I\\'m going to do,\\' said Shagrat in angry tones. \\'Put him \\nright up in the top chamber.\\' \\n\\n\\'What for? \\' growled Gorbag. \\'Haven\\'t you any lock-ups down below? \\' \\n\\n\\'He\\'s going out of harm\\'s way, I tell you,\\' answered Shagrat. \\'See? \\n\\nHe\\'s precious. I don\\'t trust all my lads, and none of yours; nor you \\nneither, when you\\'re mad for fun. He\\'s going where I want him, and where you \\nwon\\'t come, if you don\\'t keep civil. Up to the top, I say. He\\'ll be safe \\nthere.\\' \\n\\n\\'Will he?\\' said Sam. \\'You\\'re forgetting the great big elvish warrior \\nthat\\'s loose!\\' And with that he raced round the last corner, only to find \\nthat by some trick of the tunnel, or of the hearing which the Ring gave him, \\nhe had misjudged the distance. \\n\\nThe two ore-figures were still some way ahead. He could see them now, \\nblack and squat against a red glare. The passage ran straight at last, up an \\nincline; and at the end, wide open, were great double doors, leading \\nprobably to deep chambers far below the high horn of the tower. Already the \\nOres with their burden had passed inside. Gorbag and Shagrat were drawing \\nnear the gate. \\n\\nSam heard a burst of hoarse singing, blaring of horns and banging of \\ngongs, a hideous clamour. Gorbag and Shagrat were already on the threshold. \\n\\nSam yelled and brandished Sting, but his little voice was drowned in \\nthe tumult. No one heeded him. \\n\\nThe great doors slammed to. Boom. The bars of iron fell into place \\ninside. Clang. The gate was shut. Sam hurled himself against the bolted \\nbrazen plates and fell senseless to the ground. He was out in the darkness. \\nFrodo was alive but taken by the Enemy. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere ends the second part of the history of the War of the Ring. \\n\\nThe third part tells of the last defence against the Shadow, and the \\nend of the mission of the Ring-bearer in THE RETURN OF THE KING. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"trti \\n\\n\\n\\n\"THE LORD OF THE RINGS\" \\n\\nPjrt Thttt \\n\\nTHE RETURN \\nOF THE KING \\n\\n\\n\\nJ.R.R.ToIkien \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* BOOK V * \\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 1 . Minas Tirith \\n\\n\\n\\nPippin looked out from the shelter of Gandalf s cloak. He wondered if \\nhe was awake or still sleeping, still in the swift -moving dream in which he \\nhad been wrapped so long since the great ride began. The dark world was \\nrushing by and the wind sang loudly in his ears. He could see nothing but \\nthe wheeling stars, and away to his right vast shadows against the sky where \\nthe mountains of the South marched past. Sleepily he tried to reckon the \\ntimes and stages of their journey, but his memory was drowsy and uncertain. \\n\\nThere had been the first ride at terrible speed without a halt, and \\nthen in the dawn he had seen a pale gleam of gold, and they had come to the \\nsilent town and the great empty house on the hill. And hardly had they \\nreached its shelter when the winged shadow had passed over once again, and \\nmen wilted with fear. But Gandalf had spoken soft words to him, and he had \\nslept in a corner, tired but uneasy, dimly aware of comings and goings and \\nof men talking and Gandalf giving orders. And then again riding, riding in \\nthe night. This was the second, no, the third night since he had looked in \\nthe Stone. And with that hideous memory he woke fully, and shivered, and the \\nnoise of the wind became filled with menacing voices. \\n\\nA light kindled in the sky, a blaze of yellow fire behind dark barriers \\nPippin cowered back, afraid for a moment, wondering into what dreadful \\ncountry Gandalf was bearing him. He rubbed his eyes, and then he saw that it \\nwas the moon rising above the eastern shadows, now almost at the full. So \\nthe night was not yet old and for hours the dark journey would go on. He \\nstirred and spoke. \\n\\n\\'Where are we, Gandalf?\\' he asked. \\n\\n\\'In the realm of Gondor,\\' the wizard answered. \\'The land of Anurien is \\nstill passing by.\\' \\n\\nThere was a silence again for a while. Then, \\'What is that?\\' cried \\nPippin suddenly, clutching at Gandalf s cloak. \\'Look! Fire, red fire! Are \\nthere dragons in this land? Look, there is another!\\' \\n\\nFor answer Gandalf cried aloud to his horse. \\'On, Shadowfax! We must \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhasten. Time is short. See! The beacons of Gondor are alight, calling for \\naid. War is kindled. See, there is the fire on Amon Don, and flame on \\nEilenach; and there they go speeding west: Nardol, Erelas, Min-Rimmon, \\nCalenhad, and the Elalifirien on the borders of Rohan.\\' \\n\\nBut Shadowfax paused in his stride, slowing to a walk, and then he \\nlifted up his head and neighed. And out of the darkness the answering neigh \\nof other horses came; and presently the thudding of hoofs was heard, and \\nthree riders swept up and passed like flying ghosts in the moon and vanished \\ninto the West. Then Shadowfax gathered himself together and sprang away, \\nand \\n\\nthe night flowed over him like a roaring wind. \\n\\nPippin became drowsy again and paid little attention to Gandalf telling \\nhim of the customs of Gondor, and how the Lord of the City had beacons built \\non the tops of outlying hills along both borders of the great range, and \\nmaintained posts at these points where fresh horses were always in readiness \\nto bear his errand-riders to Rohan in the North, or to B elf alas in the \\nSouth. \\'It is long since the beacons of the North were lit,\\' he said; \\'and \\nin the ancient days of Gondor they were not needed, for they had the Seven \\nStones.\\' Pippin stirred uneasily. \\n\\n\\'Sleep again, and do not be afraid!\\' said Gandalf. \\'For you are not \\ngoing like Frodo to Mordor, but to Minas Tirith, and there you will be as \\nsafe as you can be anywhere in these days. If Gondor falls, or the Ring is \\ntaken, then the Shire will be no refuge.\\' \\n\\n\\'You do not comfort me,\\' said Pippin, but nonetheless sleep crept over \\nhim. The last thing that he remembered before he fell into deep dream was a \\nglimpse of high white peaks, glimmering like floating isles above the clouds \\nas they caught the light of the westering moon. He wondered where Frodo was, \\nand if he was already in Mordor, or if he was dead; and he did not know that \\nFrodo from far away looked on that same moon as it set beyond Gondor ere the \\ncoming of the day. \\n\\nPippin woke to the sound of voices. Another day of hiding and a night \\nof journey had fleeted by. It was twilight: the cold dawn was at hand again, \\nand chill grey mists were about them. Shadowfax stood steaming with sweat, \\nbut he held his neck proudly and showed no sign of weariness. Many tall men \\nheavily cloaked stood beside him, and behind them in the mist loomed a wall \\nof stone. Partly ruinous it seemed, but already before the night was passed \\nthe sound of hurried labour could be heard: beat of hammers, clink of \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntrowels, and the creak of wheels. Torches and flares glowed dully here and \\nthere in the fog. Gandalf was speaking to the men that barred his way, and \\nas he listened Pippin became aware that he himself was being discussed. \\n\\n\\'Yea truly, we know you, Mithrandir,\\' said the leader of the men, \\'and \\nyou know the pass-words of the Seven Gates and are free to go forward. But \\nwe do not know your companion. What is he? A dwarf out of the mountains \\nin \\n\\nthe North? We wish for no strangers in the land at this time, unless they be \\nmighty men of arms in whose faith and help we can trust.\\' \\n\\n\\'I will vouch for him before the seat of Denethor,\\' said Gandalf. \\'And \\nas for valour, that cannot be computed by stature. He has passed through \\nmore battles and perils than you have, Ingold, though you be twice his \\nheight; and he comes now from the storming of Isengard, of which we bear \\ntidings, and great weariness is on him, or I would wake him. His name is \\nPeregrin, a very valiant man.\\' \\n\\n\\'Man?\\' said Ingold dubiously; and the others laughed. \\n\\n\\'Man!\\' cried Pippin, now thoroughly roused. \\'Man! Indeed not! I am a \\nhobbit and no more valiant than I am a man, save perhaps now and again by \\nnecessity. Do not let Gandalf deceive you!\\' \\n\\n\\'Many a doer of great deeds might say no more,\\' said Ingold. \\'But what \\nis a hobbit?\\' \\n\\n\\'A Halfling,\\' answered Gandalf. \\'Nay, not the one that was spoken of,\\' \\nhe added seeing the wonder in the men\\'s faces. \\'Not he, yet one of his \\nkindred.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, and one who journeyed with him,\\' said Pippin. \\'And Boromir of \\nyour City was with us, and he saved me in the snows of the North, and at the \\nlast he was slain defending me from many foes.\\' \\n\\n\\'Peace!\\' said Gandalf. \\'The news of that grief should have been told \\nfirst to the father.\\' \\n\\n\\'It has been guessed already,\\' said Ingold; \\'for there have been \\nstrange portents here of late. But pass on now quickly! For the Lord of \\nMinas Tirith will be eager to see any that bear the latest tidings of his \\nson, be he man or--\\' \\n\\n\\'Hobbit,\\' said Pippin. \\'Little service can I offer to your lord, but \\nwhat I can do, I would do, remembering Boromir the brave.\\' \\n\\n\\'Fare you well!\\' said Ingold; and the men made way for Shadow fax, and \\nhe passed through a narrow gate in the wall. \\'May you bring good counsel to \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDenethor in his need, and to us all, Mithrandir!\\' Ingold cried. \\'But you \\ncome with tidings of grief and danger, as is your wont, they say.\\' \\n\\n\\'Because I come seldom but when my help is needed,\\' answered Gandalf. \\n\\'And as for counsel, to you I would say that you are over-late in repairing \\nthe wall of the Pelennor. Courage will now be your best defence against the \\nstorm that is at hand - that and such hope as I bring. For not all the \\ntidings that I bring are evil. But leave your trowels and sharpen your \\nswords!\\' \\n\\n\\'The work will be finished ere evening,\\' said Ingold. \\'This is the last \\nportion of the wall to be put in defence: the least open to attack, for it \\nlooks towards our friends of Rohan. Do you know aught of them? Will they \\nanswer the summons, think you?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, they will come. But they have fought many battles at your back. \\n\\nThis road and no road looks towards safety any longer. Be vigilant! But for \\nGandalf Stormcrow you would have seen a host of foes coming out of \\nAnurien \\n\\nand no Riders of Rohan. And you may yet. Fare you well, and sleep not!\\' \\n\\nGandalf passed now into the wide land beyond the Rammas Echor. So the \\nmen of Gondor called the out wall that they had built with great labour, \\nafter Ithilien fell under the shadow of their Enemy. For ten leagues or more \\nit ran from the mountains\\' feet and so back again, enclosing in its fence \\nthe fields of the Pelennor: fair and fertile townlands on the long slopes \\nand terraces falling to the deep levels of the Anduin. At its furthest point \\nfrom the Great Gate of the City, north-eastward, the wall was four leagues \\ndistant, and there from a frowning bank it overlooked the long flats beside \\nthe river, and men had made it high and strong; for at that point, upon a \\nwalled causeway, the road came in from the fords and bridges of Osgiliath \\nand passed through a guarded gate between embattled towers. At its nearest \\npoint the wall was little more than one league from the City, and that was \\nsouth-eastward. There Anduin, going in a wide knee about the hills of Emyn \\nArnen in South Ithilien, bent sharply west, and the out- wall rose upon its \\nvery brink; and beneath it lay the quays and landings of the Harlond for \\ncraft that came upstream from the southern fiefs. \\n\\nThe townlands were rich, with wide tilth and many orchards, and \\nhomesteads there were with oast and garner, fold and byre, and many rills \\nrippling through the green from the highlands down to Anduin. Yet the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nherdsmen and husbandmen that dwelt there were not many, and the most part \\nof \\n\\nthe people of Gondor lived in the seven circles of the City, or in the high \\nvales of the mountain-borders, in Lossarnach, or further south in fair \\nLebennin with its five swift streams. There dwelt a hardy folk between the \\nmountains and the sea. They were reckoned men of Gondor, yet their blood \\nwas \\n\\nmingled, and there were short and swarthy folk among them whose sires came \\nmore from the forgotten men who housed in the shadow of the hills in the \\nDark Years ere the coming of the kings. But beyond, in the great fief of \\nB elf alas, dwelt Prince Imrahil in his castle of Dol Amroth by the sea, and \\nhe was of high blood, and his folk also, tall men and proud with sea-grey \\neyes. \\n\\nNow after Gandalf had ridden for some time the light of day grew in the \\nsky, and Pippin roused himself and looked up. To his left lay a sea of mist, \\nrising to a bleak shadow in the East; but to his right great mountains \\nreared their heads, ranging from the West to a steep and sudden end, as if \\nin the making of the land the River had burst through a great barrier, \\ncarving out a mighty valley to be a land of battle and debate in times to \\ncome. And there where the White Mountains of Ered Nimrais came to their \\nend \\n\\nhe saw, as Gandalf had promised, the dark mass of Mount Mindolluin, the deep \\npurple shadows of its high glens, and its tall face whitening in the rising \\nday. And upon its out-thrust knee was the Guarded City, with its seven walls \\nof stone so strong and old that it seemed to have been not builded but \\ncarven by giants out of the bones of the earth. \\n\\nEven as Pippin gazed in wonder the walls passed from looming grey to \\nwhite, blushing faintly in the dawn; and suddenly the sun climbed over the \\neastern shadow and sent forth a shaft that smote the face of the City. Then \\nPippin cried aloud, for the Tower of Ecthelion, standing high within the \\ntopmost walls\\' shone out against the sky, glimmering like a spike of pearl \\nand silver, tall and fair and shapely, and its pinnacle glittered as if it \\nwere wrought of crystals; and white banners broke and fluttered from the \\nbattlements in the morning breeze\\' and high and far he heard a clear ringing \\nas of silver trumpets. \\n\\nSo Gandalf and Peregrin rode to the Great Gate of the Men of Gondor at \\nthe rising of the sun, and its iron doors rolled back before them. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Mithrandir! Mithrandir!\\' men cried. \\'Now we know that the storm is \\nindeed nigh!\\' \\n\\n\\'It is upon you,\\' said Gandalf. \\'I have ridden on its wings. Let me \\npass! I must come to your Lord Denethor, while his stewardship lasts. \\nWhatever betide, you have come to the end of the Gondor that you have \\nknown. \\n\\nLet me pass!\\' \\n\\nThen men fell back before the command of his voice and questioned him \\nno further, though they gazed in wonder at the hobbit that sat before him \\nand at the horse that bore him. For the people of the City used horses very \\nlittle and they were seldom seen in their streets, save only those ridden by \\nthe errand -riders of their lord. And they said: \\'Surely that is one of the \\ngreat steeds of the King of Rohan? Maybe the Rohirrim will come soon to \\nstrengthen us.\\' But Shadowfax walked proudly up the long winding road. \\n\\nFor the fashion of Minas Tirith was such that it was built on seven \\nlevels, each delved into the hill, and about each was set a wall, and in \\neach wall was a gate. But the gates were not set in a line: the Great Gate \\nin the City Wall was at the east point of the circuit, but the next faced \\nhalf south, and the third half north, and so to and fro upwards; so that the \\npaved way that climbed towards the Citadel turned first this way and then \\nthat across the face of the hill. And each time that it passed the line of \\nthe Great Gate it went through an arched tunnel, piercing a vast pier of \\nrock whose huge out-thrust bulk divided in two all the circles of the City \\nsave the first. For partly in the primeval shaping of the hill, partly by \\nthe mighty craft and labour of old, there stood up from the rear of the wide \\ncourt behind the Gate a towering bastion of stone, its edge sharp as a \\nship-keel facing east. Up it rose, even to the level of the topmost circle, \\nand there was crowned by a battlement; so that those in the Citadel might, \\nlike mariners in a mountainous ship, look from its peak sheer down upon the \\nGate seven hundred feet below. The entrance to the Citadel also looked \\neastward, but was delved in the heart of the rock; thence a long lamp-lit \\nslope ran up to the seventh gate. Thus men reached at last the High Court, \\nand the Place of the Fountain before the feet of the White Tower: tall and \\nshapely, fifty fathoms from its base to the pinnacle, where the banner of \\nthe Stewards floated a thousand feet above the plain. \\n\\nA strong citadel it was indeed, and not to be taken by a host of \\nenemies, if there were any within that could hold weapons; unless some foe \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncould come behind and scale the lower skirts of Mindolluin, and so come upon \\nthe narrow shoulder that joined the Hill of Guard to the mountain mass. But \\nthat shoulder, which rose to the height of the fifth wall, was hedged with \\ngreat ramparts right up to the precipice that overhung its western end; and \\nin that space stood the houses and domed tombs of bygone kings and lords, \\nfor ever silent between the mountain and the tower. \\n\\nPippin gazed in growing wonder at the great stone city, vaster and more \\nsplendid than anything that he had dreamed of; greater and stronger than \\nIsengard, and far more beautiful. Yet it was in truth falling year by year \\ninto decay; and already it lacked half the men that could have dwelt at ease \\nthere. In every street they passed some great house or court over whose \\ndoors and arched gates were carved many fair letters of strange and ancient \\nshapes: names Pippin guessed of great men and kindreds that had once dwelt \\nthere; and yet now they were silent, and no footsteps rang on their wide \\npavements, nor voice was heard in their halls, nor any face looked out from \\ndoor or empty window. \\n\\nAt last they came out of shadow to the seventh gate, and the warm sun \\nthat shone down beyond the river, as Frodo walked in the glades of Ithilien, \\nglowed here on the smooth walls and rooted pillars, and the great arch with \\nkeystone carven in the likeness of a crowned and kingly head. Gandalf \\ndismounted, for no horse was allowed in the Citadel, and Shadowfax suffered \\nhimself to be led away at the soft word of his master. \\n\\nThe Guards of the gate were robed in black, and their helms were of \\nstrange shape, high-crowned, with long cheek-guards close-fitting to the \\nface, and above the cheek-guards were set the white wings of sea-birds; but \\nthe helms gleamed with a flame of silver, for they were indeed wrought of \\nmithril, heirlooms from the glory of old days. Upon the black surcoats were \\nembroidered in white a tree blossoming like snow beneath a silver crown and \\nmany -pointed stars. This was the livery of the heirs of Elendil, and none \\nwore it now in all Gondor, save the Guards of the Citadel before the Court \\nof the Fountain where the White Tree once had grown. \\n\\nAlready it seemed that word of their coming had gone before them: and \\nat once they were admitted, silently, and without question. Quickly Gandalf \\nstrode across the white-paved court. A sweet fountain played there in the \\nmorning sun, and a sward of bright green lay about it; but in the midst, \\ndrooping over the pool, stood a dead tree, and the falling drops dripped \\nsadly from its barren and broken branches back into the clear water. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPippin glanced at it as he hurried after Gandalf. It looked mournful, \\nhe thought, and he wondered why the dead tree was left in this place where \\neverything else was well tended. \\n\\nSeven stars and seven stones and one white tree. \\n\\nThe words that Gandalf had murmured came back into his mind. And then \\nhe found himself at the doors of the great hall beneath the gleaming tower; \\nand behind the wizard he passed the tall silent door-wardens and entered the \\ncool echoing shadows of the house of stone. \\n\\nThey walked down a paved passage, long and empty, and as they went \\nGandalf spoke softly to Pippin. \\'Be careful of your words, Master Peregrin! \\nThis is no time for hobbit pertness. Thjoden is a kindly old man. Denethor \\nis of another sort, proud and subtle, a man of far greater lineage and \\npower, though he is not called a king. But he will speak most to you, and \\nquestion you much, since you can tell him of his son Boromir. He loved him \\ngreatly: too much perhaps; and the more so because they were unlike. But \\nunder cover of this love he will think it easier to learn what he witches \\nfrom you rather than from me. Do not tell him more than you need, and leave \\nquiet the matter of Frodo\\'s errand. I will deal with that in due time. And \\nsay nothing about Aragorn either, unless you must.\\' \\n\\n\\'Why not? What is wrong with Strider?\\' Pippin whispered. \\'He meant to \\ncome here, didn\\'t he? And he\\'ll be arriving soon himself anyway.\\' \\n\\n\\'Maybe, maybe,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Though if he comes, it is likely to be \\nin some way that no one expects, not even Denethor. It will be better so. At \\nleast he should come unheralded by us.\\' \\n\\nGandalf halted before a tall door of polished metal. \\'See, Master \\nPippin, there is no time to instruct you now in the history of Gondor; \\nthough it might have been better, if you had learned something of it, when \\nyou were still birds-nesting and playing truant in the woods of the Shire. \\n\\nDo as I bid! It is scarcely wise when bringing the news of the death of his \\nheir to a mighty lord to speak over much of the coming of one who will, if \\nhe comes, claim the kingship. Is that enough?\\' \\n\\n\\'Kingship?\\' said Pippin amazed. \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Gandalf. \\'If you have walked all these days with closed \\nears and mind asleep, wake up now!\\' He knocked on the door. \\n\\nThe door opened, but no one could be seen to open it. Pippin looked \\ninto a great hall. It was lit by deep windows in the wide aisles at either \\nside, beyond the rows of tall pillars that upheld the roof. Monoliths of \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nblack marble, they rose to great capitals carved in many strange figures of \\nbeasts and leaves; and far above in shadow the wide vaulting gleamed with \\ndull gold, inset with flowing traceries of many colours. No hangings nor \\nstoried webs, nor any things of woven stuff or of wood, were to be seen in \\nthat long solemn hall; but between the pillars there stood a silent company \\nof tall images graven in cold stone. \\n\\nSuddenly Pippin was reminded of the hewn rocks of Argonath, and awe \\nfell on him, as he looked down that avenue of kings long dead. At the far \\nend upon a dais of many steps was set a high throne under a canopy of marble \\nshaped like a crowned helm; behind it was carved upon the wall and set with \\ngems an image of a tree in flower. But the throne was empty. At the foot of \\nthe dais, upon the lowest step which was broad and deep, there was a stone \\nchair, black and unadorned, and on it sat an old man gazing at his lap. In \\nhis hand was a white rod with a golden knob. He did not look up. Solemnly \\nthey paced the long floor towards him, until they stood three paces from his \\nfootstool. Then Gandalf spoke. \\n\\n\\'Hail, Lord and Steward of Minas Tirith, Denethor son of Ecthelion! I \\nam come with counsel and tidings in this dark hour.\\' \\n\\nThen the old man looked up. Pippin saw his carven face with its proud \\nbones and skin like ivory, and the long curved nose between the dark deep \\neyes; and he was reminded not so much of Boromir as of Aragorn. \\'Dark \\nindeed \\n\\nis the hour,\\' said the old man, \\'and at such times you are wont to come, \\nMithrandir. But though all the signs forebode that the doom of Gondor is \\ndrawing nigh, less now to me is that darkness than my own darkness. It has \\nbeen told to me that you bring with you one who saw my son die. Is this he?\\' \\n\\n\\'It is,\\' said Gandalf. \\'One of the twain. The other is with Thjoden of \\nRohan and may come hereafter. Halflings they are, as you see, yet this is \\nnot he of whom the omens spoke.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yet a Halfling still,\\' said Denethor grimly, \\'and little love do I \\nbear the name, since those accursed words came to trouble our counsels and \\ndrew away my son on the wild errand to his death. My Boromir! Now we \\nhave \\n\\nneed of you. Faramir should have gone in his stead.\\' \\n\\n\\'He would have gone,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Be not unjust in your grief! \\nBoromir claimed the errand and would not suffer any other to have it. He was \\na masterful man, and one to take what he desired. I journeyed far with him \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand learned much of his mood. But you speak of his death. You have had news \\nof that ere we came?\\' \\n\\n\\'I have received this,\\' said Denethor, and laying down his rod he \\nlifted from his lap the thing that he had been gazing at. In each hand he \\nheld up one half of a great horn cloven through the middle: a wild-ox horn \\nbound with silver. \\n\\nThat is the horn that Boromir always wore!\\' cried Pippin. \\n\\n\\'Verily,\\' said Denethor. \\'And in my turn I bore it, and so did each \\neldest son of our house, far back into the vanished years before the failing \\nof the kings, since Vorondil father of Mardil hunted the wild kine of Araw \\nin the far fields of Rhyn. I heard it blowing dim upon the northern marches \\nthirteen days ago, and the River brought it to me, broken: it will wind no \\nmore.\\' He paused and there was a heavy silence. Suddenly he turned his black \\nglance upon Pippin. \\'What say you to that, Halfling?\\' \\n\\n\\'Thirteen, thirteen days,\\' faltered Pippin. \\'Yes, I think that would be \\nso. Yes, I stood beside him, as he blew the horn. But no help came. Only \\nmore ores.\\' \\n\\n\\'So,\\' said Denethor, looking keenly at Pippin\\'s face. \\'You were there? \\n\\nTell me more! Why did no help come? And how did you escape, and yet he \\ndid \\n\\nnot, so mighty a man as he was, and only ores to withstand him?\\' \\n\\nPippin flushed and forgot his fear. \\'The mightiest man may be slain by \\none arrow,\\' he said; \\'and Boromir was pierced by many. When last I saw him \\nhe sank beside a tree and plucked a black -feathered shaft from his side. \\n\\nThen I swooned and was made captive. I saw him no more, and know no \\nmore. \\n\\nBut I honour his memory, for he was very valiant. He died to save us, my \\nkinsman Meriadoc and myself, waylaid in the woods by the soldiery of the \\nDark Lord; and though he fell and failed, my gratitude is none the less.\\' \\n\\nThen Pippin looked the old man in the eye, for pride stirred strangely \\nwithin him, still stung by the scorn and suspicion in that cold voice. \\n\\n\\'Little service, no doubt, will so great a lord of Men think to find in a \\nhobbit, a halfling from the northern Shire; yet such as it is, I will offer \\nit, in payment of my debt.\\' Twitching aside his grey cloak, Pippin drew \\nforth his small sword and laid it at Denethor\\'s feet. \\n\\nA pale smile, like a gleam of cold sun on a winter\\'s evening, passed \\nover the old man\\'s face; but he bent his head and held out his hand, laying \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe shards of the horn aside. \\'Give me the weapon!\\' he said. \\n\\nPippin lifted it and presented the hilt to him. \\'Whence came this?\\' \\nsaid Denethor. \\'Many, many years lie on it. Surely this is a blade wrought \\nby our own kindred in the North in the deep past?\\' \\n\\n\\'It came out of the mounds that lie on the borders of my country \\' said \\nPippin. \\'But only evil wights dwell there now, and I will not willingly tell \\nmore of them.\\' \\n\\n\\'I see that strange tales are woven about you,\\' said Denethor, \\'and \\nonce again it is shown that looks may belie the man - or the halfling. I \\naccept your service. For you are not daunted by words; and you have \\ncourteous speech, strange though the sound of it may be to us in the South. \\nAnd we shall have need of all folk of courtesy, be they great or small, in \\nthe days to come. Swear to me now!\\' \\n\\n\\'Take the hilt,\\' said Gandalf, \\'and speak after the Lord, if you are \\nresolved on this.\\' \\n\\n\\'I am,\\' said Pippin. \\n\\nThe old man laid the sword along his lap, and Pippin put his hand to \\nthe hilt, and said slowly after Denethor: \\n\\n\\'Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor, and to the Lord and \\nSteward of the realm, to speak and to be silent, to do and to let be, to \\ncome and to go, in need or plenty, in peace or war, in living or dying, from \\nthis hour henceforth, until my lord release me, or death take me, or the \\nworld end. So say I, Peregrin son of Paladin of the Shire of the Halflings.\\' \\n\\nAnd this do I hear, Denethor son of Ecthelion, Lord of Gondor, Steward \\nof the High King, and I will not forget it, nor fail to reward that which is \\ngiven: fealty with love, valour with honour, oath- breaking with vengeance.\\' \\nThen Pippin received back his sword and put it in its sheath. \\n\\n\\'And now,\\' said Denethor, \\'my first command to you: speak and be not \\nsilent! Tell me your full tale, and see that you recall all that you can of \\nBoromir, my son. Sit now and begin!\\' As he spoke he struck a small silver \\ngong that stood near his footstool, and at once servants came forward. \\nPippin saw then that they had been standing in alcoves on either side of the \\ndoor, unseen as he and Gandalf entered. \\n\\n\\'Bring wine and food and seats for the guests,\\' said Denethor, \\'and see \\nthat none trouble us for one hour.\\' \\n\\n\\'It is all that I have to spare, for there is much else to heed,\\' he \\nsaid to Gandalf. \\'Much of more import, it may seem, and yet to me less \\n\\n\\n\\n\\npressing. But maybe we can speak again at the end of the day.\\' \\n\\n\\'And earlier, it is to be hoped,\\' said Gandalf. \\'For I have not ridden \\nhither from Isengard, one hundred and fifty leagues, with the speed of wind, \\nonly to bring you one small warrior, however courteous. Is it naught to you \\nthat Thjoden has fought a great battle and that Isengard is overthrown, and \\nthat I have broken the staff of Saruman?\\' \\n\\n\\'It is much to me. But I know already sufficient of these deeds for my \\nown counsel against the menace of the East.\\' He turned his dark eyes on \\nGandalf, and now Pippin saw a likeness between the two, and he felt the \\nstrain between them, almost as if he saw a line of smouldering fire, drawn \\nfrom eye to eye, that might suddenly burst into flame. \\n\\nDenethor looked indeed much more like a great wizard than Gandalf did, \\nmore kingly, beautiful, and powerful; and older. Yet by a sense other than \\nsight Pippin perceived that Gandalf had the greater power and the deeper \\nwisdom, and a majesty that was veiled. And he was older, far older. \\'How \\nmuch older?\\' he wondered, and then he thought how odd it was that he had \\nnever thought about it before. Treebeard had said something about wizards, \\nbut even then he had not thought of Gandalf as one of them. What was \\nGandalf? In what far time and place did he come into the world, and when \\nwould he leave it? And then his musings broke off, and he saw that Denethor \\nand Gandalf still looked each other in the eye, as if reading the other\\'s \\nmind. But it was Denethor who first withdrew his gaze. \\n\\n\\'Yea,\\' he said; \\'for though the Stones be lost, they say, still the \\nlords of Gondor have keener sight than lesser men, and many messages come \\nto \\n\\nthem. But sit now!\\' \\n\\nThen men came bearing a chair and a low stool, and one brought a salver \\nwith a silver flagon and cups, and white cakes. Pippin sat down, but he \\ncould not take his eyes from the old lord. Was it so, or had he only \\nimagined it, that as he spoke of the Stones a sudden gleam of his eye had \\nglanced upon Pippin\\'s face? \\n\\n\\'Now tell me your tale, my liege,\\' said Denethor, half kindly; half \\nmockingly. \\'For the words of one whom my son so befriended will be \\nwelcome \\nindeed.\\' \\n\\nPippin never forgot that hour in the great hall under the piercing eye \\nof the Lord of Gondor, stabbed ever and anon by his shrewd questions, and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nall the while conscious of Gandalf at his side, watching and listening, and \\n(so Pippin felt) holding in check a rising wrath and impatience. When the \\nhour was over and Denethor again rang the gong, Pippin felt worn out. \\'It \\ncannot be more than nine o\\'clock,\\' he thought. \\'I could now eat three \\nbreakfasts on end.\\' \\n\\n\\'Lead the Lord Mithrandir to the housing prepared for him,\\' said \\nDenethor, \\'and his companion may lodge with him for the present, if he will. \\nBut be it known that I have now sworn him to my service, and he shall be \\nknown as Peregrin son of Paladin and taught the lesser pass-words. Send word \\nto the Captains that they shall wait on me here, as soon as may be after the \\nthird hour has rung. \\n\\n\\'And you, my Lord Mithrandir, shall come too, as and when you will. \\nNone shall hinder your coming to me at any time, save only in my brief hours \\nof sleep. Let your wrath at an old man\\'s folly run off and then return to my \\ncomfort!\\' \\n\\n\\'Folly?\\' said Gandalf. \\'Nay, my lord, when you are a dotard you will \\ndie. You can use even your grief as a cloak. Do you think that I do not \\nunderstand your purpose in questioning for an hour one who knows the least, \\nwhile I sit by?\\' \\n\\n\\'If you understand it, then be content,\\' returned Denethor. \\'Pride \\nwould be folly that disdained help and counsel at need; but you deal out \\nsuch gifts according to your own designs. Yet the Lord of Gondor is not to \\nbe made the tool of other men\\'s purposes, however worthy. And to him there \\nis no purpose higher in the world as it now stands than the good of Gondor; \\nand the rule of Gondor, my lord, is mine and no other man\\'s, unless the king \\nshould come again.\\' \\n\\n\\'Unless the king should come again?\\' said Gandalf. \\'Well, my lord \\nSteward, it is your task to keep some kingdom still against that event, \\nwhich few now look to see. In that task you shall have all the aid that you \\nare pleased to ask for. But I will say this: the rule of no realm is mine, \\nneither of Gondor nor any other, great or small. But all worthy things that \\nare in peril as the world now stands, those are my care. And for my part, I \\nshall not wholly fail of my task, though Gondor should perish, if anything \\npasses through this night that can still grow fair or bear fruit and flower \\nagain in days to come. For I also am a steward. Did you not know?\\' And with \\nthat he turned and strode from the hall with Pippin running at his side. \\n\\nGandalf did not look at Pippin or speak a word to him as they went. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTheir guide brought them from the doors of the hall, and then led them \\nacross the Court of the Fountain into a lane between tall buildings of \\nstone. After several turns they came to a house close to the wall of the \\ncitadel upon the north side, not far from the shoulder that linked the hill \\nwith the mountain. Within, upon the first floor above the street, up a wide \\ncarven stair, he showed them to a fair room, light and airy, with goodly \\nhangings of dull gold sheen unfigured. It was sparely furnished, having but \\na small table, two chairs and a bench; but at either side there were \\ncurtained alcoves and well -clad beds within with vessels and basins for \\nwashing. There were three high narrow windows that looked northward over \\nthe \\n\\ngreat curve of Anduin, still shrouded in mists, towards the Emyn Muil and \\nRauros far away. Pippin had to climb on the bench to look out over the deep \\nstone sill. \\n\\nAre you angry with me, Gandalf?\\' he said, as their guide went out and \\nclosed the door. \\'I did the best I could.\\' \\n\\n\\'You did indeed!\\' said Gandalf, laughing suddenly; and he came and \\nstood beside Pippin, putting his arm about the hobbit\\'s shoulders and gazing \\nout of the window. Pippin glanced in some wonder at the face now close \\nbeside his own, for the sound of that laugh had been gay and merry. Yet in \\nthe wizard\\'s face he saw at first only lines of care and sorrow; though as \\nhe looked more intently he perceived that under all there was a great joy: a \\nfountain of mirth enough to set a kingdom laughing, were it to gush forth. \\n\\n\\'Indeed you did your best,\\' said the wizard; \\'and I hope that it may be \\nlong before you find yourself in such a tight corner again between two such \\nterrible old men. Still the Lord of Gondor learned more from you than you \\nmay have guessed, Pippin. You could not hide the fact that Boromir did not \\nlead the Company from Moria, and that there was one among you of high \\nhonour \\n\\nwho was coming to Minas Tirith; and that he had a famous sword. Men think \\nmuch about the stories of old days in Gondor; and Denethor has given long \\nthought to the rhyme and to the words Isildur\\'s Bane, since Boromir went \\naway. \\n\\n\\'He is not as other men of this time, Pippin, and whatever be his \\ndescent from father to son, by some chance the blood of Westernesse runs \\nnearly true in him; as it does in his other son, Faramir, and yet did not in \\nBoromir whom he loved best. He has long sight. He can perceive, if he bends \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhis will thither, much of what is passing in the minds of men, even of those \\nthat dwell far off. It is difficult to deceive him, and dangerous to try. \\n\\n\\'Remember that! For you are now sworn to his service. I do not know \\nwhat put it into your head, or your heart, to do that. But it was well done. \\n\\nI did not hinder it, for generous deed should not be checked by cold \\ncounsel. It touched his heart, as well (may I say it) as pleasing his \\nhumour. And at least you are free now to move about as you will in Minas \\nTirith - when you are not on duty. For there is another side to it. You are \\nat his command; and he will not forget. Be wary still!\\' \\n\\nHe fell silent and sighed. \\'Well, no need to brood on what tomorrow may \\nbring. For one thing, tomorrow will be certain to bring worse than today, \\nfor many days to come. And there is nothing more that I can do to help it. \\n\\nThe board is set, and the pieces are moving. One piece that I greatly desire \\nto find is Faramir, now the heir of Denethor. I do not think that he is in \\nthe City; but I have had no time to gather news. I must go. Pippin. I must \\ngo to this lords\\' council and learn what I can. But the Enemy has the move, \\nand he is about to open his full game. And pawns are likely to see as much \\nof it as any, Peregrin son of Paladin, soldier of Gondor. Sharpen your \\nblade!\\' \\n\\nGandalf went to the door, and there he turned. \\'I am in haste Pippin,\\' \\nhe said. \\'Do me a favour when you go out. Even before you rest, if you are \\nnot too weary. Go and find Shadowfax and see how he is housed. These \\npeople \\n\\nare kindly to beasts, for they are a good and wise folk, but they have less \\nskill with horses than some.\\' \\n\\nWith that Gandalf went out; and as he did so, there came the note of a \\nclear sweet bell ringing in a tower of the citadel. Three strokes it rang, \\nlike silver in the air, and ceased: the third hour from the rising of the \\nsun. \\n\\nAfter a minute Pippin went to the door and down the stair and looked \\nabout the street. The sun was now shining warm and bright, and the towers \\nand tall houses cast long clear-cut shadows westward. High in the blue air \\nMount Mindolluin lifted its white helm and snowy cloak. Armed men went to \\nand fro in the ways of the City, as if going at the striking of the hour to \\nchanges of post and duty. \\n\\n\\'Nine o\\'clock we\\'d call it in the Shire,\\' said Pippin aloud to himself. \\n\\n\\'Just the time for a nice breakfast by the open window in spring sunshine. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd how I should like breakfast! Do these people ever have it, or is it \\nover? And when do they have dinner, and where?\\' \\n\\nPresently he noticed a man, clad in black and white, coming along the \\nnarrow street from the centre of the citadel towards him. Pippin felt lonely \\nand made up his mind to speak as the man passed; but he had no need. The man \\ncame straight up to him. \\n\\n\\'You are Peregrin the Halfling?\\' he said. \\'I am told that you have been \\nsworn to the service of the Lord and of the City. Welcome! He held out his \\nhand and Pippin took it. \\n\\n\\'I am named Beregond son of Baranor. I have no duty this morning, and I \\nhave been sent to you to teach you the pass-words, and to tell you some of \\nthe many things that no doubt you will wish to know. And for my part, I \\nwould learn of you also. For never before have we seen a halfling in this \\nland and though we have heard rumour of them, little is said of them in any \\ntale that we know. Moreover you are a friend of Mithrandir. Do you know him \\nwell?\\' \\n\\n\\'Well,\\' said Pippin. \\'I have known of him all my short life, as you \\nmight say; and lately I have travelled far with him. But there is much to \\nread in that book, and I cannot claim to have seen more than a page or two. \\n\\nYet perhaps I know him as well as any but a few. Aragorn was the only one of \\nour Company, I think, who really knew him.\\' \\n\\n\\'Aragorn?\\' said Beregond. \\'Who is he?\\' \\n\\n\\'Oh,\\' stammered Pippin, \\'he was a man who went about with us. I think \\nhe is in Rohan now.\\' \\n\\n\\'You have been in Rohan, I hear. There is much that I would ask you of \\nthat land also; for we put much of what little hope we have in its people. \\n\\nBut I am forgetting my errand, which was first to answer what you would ask. \\nWhat would you know, Master Peregrin?\\' \\n\\n\\'Er well,\\' said Pippin, \\'if I may venture to say so, rather a burning \\nquestion in my mind at present is, well, what about breakfast and all that? \\n\\nI mean, what are the meal-times, if you understand me, and where is the \\ndining-room, if there is one? And the inns? I looked, but never a one could \\nI see as we rode up, though I had been borne up by the hope of a draught of \\nale as soon as we came to the homes of wise and courtly men.\\' \\n\\nBeregond looked at him gravely. \\'An old campaigner, I see,\\' he said. \\n\\n\\'They say that men who go warring afield look ever to the next hope of food \\nand of drink; though I am not a travelled man myself. Then you have not yet \\n\\n\\n\\n\\neaten today?\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, yes, to speak in courtesy, yes,\\' said Pippin. \\'But no more than \\na cup of wine and a white cake or two by the kindness of your lord; but he \\nracked me for it with an hour of questions, and that is hungry work.\\' \\n\\nBeregond laughed. \\'At the table small men may do the greater deeds, we \\nsay. But you have broken your fast as well as any man in the Citadel, and \\nwith greater honour. This is a fortress and a tower of guard and is now in \\nposture of war. We rise ere the Sun, and take a morsel in the grey light, \\nand go to our duties at the opening hour. But do not despair!\\' He laughed \\nagain, seeing the dismay in Pippin\\'s face. \\'Those who have had heavy duty \\ntake somewhat to refresh their strength in the mid-morning. Then there is \\nthe nuncheon, at noon or after as duties allow; and men gather for the \\ndaymeal, and such mirth as there still may be, about the hour of sunset. \\n\\n\\'Come! We will walk a little and then go find us some refreshment, and \\neat and drink on the battlement, and survey the fair morning.\\' \\n\\n\\'One moment!\\' said Pippin blushing. \\'Greed, or hunger by your courtesy, \\nput it out of my mind. But Gandalf, Mithrandir as you call him, asked me to \\nsee to his horse - Shadowfax, a great steed of Rohan, and the apple of the \\nking\\'s eye, I am told, though he has given him to Mithrandir for his \\nservices. I think his new master loves the beast better than he loves many \\nmen, and if his good will is of any value to this city, you will treat \\nShadowfax with all honour: with greater kindness than you have treated this \\nhobbit, if it is possible.\\' \\n\\n\\'Hobbit?\\' said Beregond. \\n\\n\\'That is what we call ourselves,\\' said Pippin. \\n\\n\\'I am glad to learn it,\\' said Beregond, \\'for now I may say that strange \\naccents do not mar fair speech, and hobbits are a fair-spoken folk. But \\ncome! You shall make me acquainted with this good horse. I love beasts, and \\nwe see them seldom in this stony city; for my people came from the \\nmountain-vales, and before that from Ithilien. But fear not! The visit shall \\nbe short, a mere call of courtesy, and we will go thence to the butteries.\\' \\n\\nPippin found that Shadowfax had been well housed and tended. For in the \\nsixth circle, outside the walls of the citadel, there were some fair stables \\nwhere a few swift horses were kept, hard by the lodgings of the \\nerrand-riders of the Lord: messengers always ready to go at the urgent \\ncommand of Denethor or his chief captains. But now all the horses and the \\nriders were out and away. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShadowfax whinnied as Pippin entered the stable and turned his head. \\n\\'Good morning!\\' said Pippin. \\'Gandalf will come as soon as he may. He is \\nbusy, but he sends greetings, and I am to see that all is well with you; and \\nyou resting, I hope, after your long labours.\\' \\n\\nShadowfax tossed his head and stamped. But he allowed Beregond to \\nhandle his head gently and stroke his great flanks. \\n\\n\\'He looks as if he were spoiling for a race, and not newly come from a \\ngreat journey,\\' said Beregond. \\'How strong and proud he is! Where is his \\nharness? It should be rich and fair.\\' \\n\\n\\'None is rich and fair enough for him,\\' said Pippin. \\'He will have \\nnone. If he will consent to bear you, bear you he does; and if not, well, no \\nbit, bridle, whip, or thong will tame him. Farewell, Shadowfax! Have \\npatience. Battle is coming.\\' \\n\\nShadowfax lifted up his head and neighed, so that the stable shook, and \\nthey covered their ears. Then they took their leave, seeing that the manger \\nwas well filled. \\n\\n\\'And now for our manger,\\' said Beregond, and he led Pippin back to the \\ncitadel, and so to a door in the north side of the great tower. There they \\nwent down a long cool stair into a wide alley lit with lamps. There were \\nhatches in the walls at the side, and one of these was open. \\n\\n\\'This is the storehouse and buttery of my company of the Guard.\\' said \\nBeregond. \\'Greetings, Targon!\\' he called through the hatch. \\'It is early \\nyet, but here is a newcomer that the Lord has taken into his service. He has \\nridden long and far with a tight belt, and has had sore labour this morning, \\nand he is hungry. Give us what you have!\\' \\n\\nThey got there bread, and butter, and cheese and apples: the last of \\nthe winter store, wrinkled but sound and sweet; and a leather flagon of \\nnew-drawn ale, and wooden platters and cups. They put all into a wicker \\nbasket and climbed back into the sun; and Beregond brought Pippin to a place \\nat the east end of the great out-thrust battlement where there was an \\nembrasure in the walls with a stone seat beneath the sill. From there they \\ncould look out on the morning over the world. \\n\\nThey ate and drank; and they talked now of Gondor and its ways and \\ncustoms, now of the Shire and the strange countries that Pippin had seen. \\n\\nAnd ever as they talked Beregond was more amazed, and looked with greater \\nwonder at the hobbit, swinging his short legs as he sat on the seat, or \\nstanding tiptoe upon it to peer over the sill at the lands below. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'I will not hide from you, Master Peregrin,\\' said Beregond, \\'that to us \\nyou look almost as one of our children, a lad of nine summers or so; and yet \\nyou have endured perils and seen marvels that few of our greybeards could \\nboast of. I thought it was the whim of our Lord to take him a noble page, \\nafter the manner of the kings of old, they say. But I see that it is not so, \\nand you must pardon my foolishness.\\' \\n\\n\\'I do,\\' said Pippin. \\'Though you are not far wrong. I am still little \\nmore than a boy in the reckoning of my own people, and it will be four years \\nyet before I \"come of age\", as we say in the Shire: But do not bother about \\nme. Come and look and tell me what I can see.\\' \\n\\nThe sun was now climbing, and the mists in the vale below had been \\ndrawn up. The last of them were floating away, just overhead, as wisps of \\nwhite cloud borne on the stiffening breeze from the East, that was now \\nflapping and tugging the flags and white standards of the citadel. Away down \\nin the valley-bottom, five leagues or so as the eye leaps, the Great River \\ncould now be seen grey and glittering, coming out of the north-west, and \\nbending in a mighty sweep south and west again, till it was lost to view in \\na haze and shimmer, far beyond which lay the Sea fifty leagues away. \\n\\nPippin could see all the Pelennor laid out before him, dotted into the \\ndistance with farmsteads and little walls, barns and byres, but nowhere \\ncould he see any kine or other beasts. Many roads and tracks crossed the \\ngreen fields, and there was much coming and going: wains moving in lines \\ntowards the Great Gate, and others passing out. Now and again a horseman \\nwould ride up, and leap from the saddle and hasten into the City. But most \\nof the traffic went out along the chief highway, and that turned south, and \\nthen bending swifter than the River skirted the hills and passed soon from \\nsight. It was wide and well -paved, and along its eastern edge ran a broad \\ngreen riding -track, and beyond that a wall. On the ride horsemen galloped to \\nand fro, but all the street seemed to be choked with great covered wains \\ngoing south. But soon Pippin saw that all was in fact well-ordered: the \\nwains were moving in three lines, one swifter drawn by horses; another \\nslower, great waggons with fair housings of many colours, drawn by oxen; and \\nalong the west rim of the road many smaller carts hauled by trudging men. \\n\\n\\'That is the road to the vales of Tumladen and Lossarnach, and the \\nmountain-villages, and then on to Lebennin,\\' said Beregond. \\'There go the \\nlast of the wains that bear away to refuge the aged the children, and the \\nwomen that must go with them. They must all be gone from the Gate and the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nroad clear for a league before noon: that was the order. It is a sad \\nnecessity.\\' He sighed. \\'Few, maybe, of those now sundered will meet again. \\nAnd there were always too few children in this city; but now there are \\nnone-save some young lads that will not depart, and may find some task to \\ndo: my own son is one of them.\\' \\n\\nThey fell silent for a while. Pippin gazed anxiously eastward, as if at \\nany moment he might see thousands of ores pouring over the fields. \\'What can \\nI see there?\\' he asked, pointing down to the middle of the great curve of \\nthe Anduin. \\'Is that another city, or what is it?\\' \\n\\n\\'It was a city,\\' said Beregond, \\'the chief city of Gondor, of which \\nthis was only a fortress. For that is the ruin of Osgiliath on either side \\nof Anduin, which our enemies took and burned long ago. Yet we won it back in \\nthe days of the youth of Denethor: not to dwell in, but to hold as an \\noutpost, and to rebuild the bridge for the passage of our arms. And then \\ncame the Fell Riders out of Minas Morgul.\\' \\n\\n\\'The Black Riders?\\' said Pippin, opening his eyes, and they were wide \\nand dark with an old fear re-awakened. \\n\\n\\'Yes, they were black,\\' said Beregond, \\'and I see that you know \\nsomething of them, though you have not spoken of them in any of your tales.\\' \\n\\n\\'I know of them,\\' said Pippin softly, \\'but I will not speak of them \\nnow, so near, so near.\\' He broke off and lifted his eyes above the River, \\nand it seemed to him that all he could see was a vast and threatening \\nshadow. Perhaps it was mountains looming on the verge of sight, their jagged \\nedges softened by wellnigh twenty leagues of misty air; perhaps it was but a \\ncloud-wall, and beyond that again a yet deeper gloom. But even as he looked \\nit seemed to his eyes that the gloom was growing and gathering, very slowly, \\nslowly rising to smother the regions of the sun. \\n\\n\\'So near to Mordor?\\' said Beregond quietly. \\'Yes, there it lies. We \\nseldom name it; but we have dwelt ever in sight of that shadow: sometimes it \\nseems fainter and more distant; sometimes nearer and darker. It is growing \\nand darkening now; and therefore our fear and disquiet grow too. And the \\nFell Riders, less than a year ago they won back the crossings, and many of \\nour best men were slain. Boromir it was that drove the enemy at last back \\nfrom this western shore, and we hold still the near half of Osgiliath. For a \\nlittle while. But we await now a new onslaught there. Maybe the chief \\nonslaught of the war that comes.\\' \\n\\n\\'When?\\' said Pippin. \\'Have you a guess? For I saw the beacons last \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnight and the errand-riders; and Gandalf said that it was a sign that war \\nhad begun. He seemed in a desperate hurry. But now everything seems to have \\nslowed up again.\\' \\n\\n\\'Only because everything is now ready,\\' said Beregond. \\'It is but the \\ndeep breath before the plunge.\\' \\n\\n\\'But why were the beacons lit last night?\\' \\n\\n\\'It is over -late to send for aid when you are already besieged,\\' \\nanswered Beregond. \\'But I do not know the counsel of the Lord and his \\ncaptains. They have many ways of gathering news. And the Lord Denethor is \\nunlike other men: he sees far. Some say that as he sits alone in his high \\nchamber in the Tower at night, and bends his thought this way and that, he \\ncan read somewhat of the future; and that he will at times search even the \\nmind of the Enemy, wrestling with him. And so it is that he is old, worn \\nbefore his time. But however that may be, my lord Faramir is abroad, beyond \\nthe River on some perilous errand, and he may have sent tidings. \\n\\n\\'But if you would know what I think set the beacons ablaze, it was the \\nnews that came yestereve out of Lebennin. There is a great fleet drawing \\nnear to the mouths of Anduin, manned by the corsairs of Umbar in the South. \\nThey have long ceased to fear the might of Gondor, and they have allied them \\nwith the Enemy, and now make a heavy stroke in his cause. For this attack \\nwill draw off much of the help that we looked to have from Lebennin and \\nBelfalas, where folk are hardy and numerous. All the more do our thoughts go \\nnorth to Rohan; and the more glad are we for these tidings of victory that \\nyou bring. \\n\\n\\'And yet\\' - he paused and stood up, and looked round, north, east, and \\nsouth - \\'the doings at Isengard should warn us that we are caught now in a \\ngreat net and strategy. This is no longer a bickering at the fords, raiding \\nfrom Ithilien and from Anurien, ambushing and pillaging. This is a great war \\nlong -planned, and we are but one piece in it, whatever pride may say. Things \\nmove in the far East beyond the Inland Sea, it is reported; and north in \\nMirkwood and beyond; and south in Harad. And now all realms shall be put to \\nthe test, to stand, or fall - under the Shadow. \\n\\n\\'Yet, Master Peregrin, we have this honour: ever we bear the brunt of \\nthe chief hatred of the Dark Lord, for that hatred comes down out of the \\ndepths of time and over the deeps of the Sea. Here will the hammer-stroke \\nfall hardest. And for that reason Mithrandir came hither in such haste. For \\nif we fall, who shall stand? And, Master Peregrin, do you see any hope that \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwe shall stand?\\' \\n\\nPippin did not answer. He looked at the great walls, and the towers and \\nbrave banners, and the sun in the high sky, and then at the gathering gloom \\nin the East; and he thought of the long fingers of that Shadow: of the ores \\nin the woods and the mountains, the treason of Isengard, the birds of evil \\neye, and the Black Riders even in the lanes of the Shire - and of the winged \\nterror, the Nazgyl. He shuddered, and hope seemed to wither. And even at \\nthat moment the sun for a second faltered and was obscured, as though a dark \\nwing had passed across it. Almost beyond hearing he thought he caught, high \\nand far up in the heavens, a cry: faint, but heart-quelling, cruel and cold. \\n\\nHe blanched and cowered against the wall. \\n\\n\\'What was that?\\' asked Beregond. \\'You also felt something?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' muttered Pippin. \\'It is the sign of our fall, and the shadow of \\ndoom, a Fell Rider of the air.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, the shadow of doom,\\' said Beregond. \\'I fear that Minas Tirith \\nshall fall. Night comes. The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away.\\' \\n\\nFor a time they sat together with bowed heads and did not speak. Then \\nsuddenly Pippin looked up and saw that the sun was still shining and the \\nbanners still streaming in the breeze. He shook himself. \\'It is passed,\\' he \\nsaid. \\'No, my heart will not yet despair. Gandalf fell and has returned and \\nis with us. We may stand, if only on one leg, or at least be left still upon \\nour knees.\\' \\n\\n\\'Rightly said!\\' cried Beregond, rising and striding to and fro. \\'Nay, \\nthough all things must come utterly to an end in time, Gondor shall not \\nperish yet. Not though the walls be taken by a reckless foe that will build \\na hill of carrion before them. There are still other fastnesses, and secret \\nways of escape into the mountains. Hope and memory shall live still in some \\nhidden valley where the grass is green.\\' \\n\\n\\'All the same, I wish it was over for good or ill.\\' said Pippin. \\'I am \\nno warrior at all and dislike any thought of battle; but waiting on the edge \\nof one that I can\\'t escape is worst of all. What a long day it seems \\nalready ! I should be happier, if we were not obliged to stand and watch, \\nmaking no move, striking nowhere first. No stroke would have been struck in \\nRohan, I think, but for Gandalf.\\' \\n\\n\\'Ah, there you lay your finger on the sore that many feel!\\' said \\nBeregond. \\'But things may change when Faramir returns. He is bold, more bold \\nthan many deem; for in these days men are slow to believe that a captain can \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbe wise and learned in the scrolls of lore and song, as he is, and yet a man \\nof hardihood and swift judgement in the field. But such is Faramir. Less \\nreckless and eager than Boromir, but not less resolute. Yet what indeed can \\nhe do? We cannot assault the mountains of - of yonder realm. Our reach is \\nshortened, and we cannot strike till some foe comes within it. Then our hand \\nmust be heavy!\\' He smote the hilt of his sword. \\n\\nPippin looked at him: tall and proud and noble, as all the men that he \\nhad yet seen in that land; and with a glitter in his eye as he thought of \\nthe battle. \\'Alas! my own hand feels as light as a feather,\\' he thought, but \\nhe said nothing. \\'A pawn did Gandalf say? Perhaps but on the wrong \\nchessboard.\\' \\n\\nSo they talked until the sun reached its height, and suddenly the \\nnoon-bells were rung, and there was a stir in the citadel; for all save the \\nwatchmen were going to their meal. \\n\\n\\'Will you come with me?\\' said Beregond. \\'You may join my mess for this \\nday. I do not know to what company you will be assigned; or the Lord may \\nhold you at his own command. But you will be welcome. And it will be well to \\nmeet as many men as you may, while there is yet time.\\' \\n\\n\\'I shall be glad to come,\\' said Pippin. \\'I am lonely, to tell you the \\ntruth. I left my best friend behind in Rohan, and I have had no one to talk \\nto or jest with. Perhaps I could really join your company? Are you the \\ncaptain? If so, you could take me on, or speak for me?\\' \\n\\n\\'Nay, nay,\\' Beregond laughed, \\'I am no captain. Neither office nor rank \\nnor lordship have I, being but a plain man of arms of the Third Company of \\nthe Citadel. Yet, Master Peregrin, to be only a man of arms of the Guard of \\nthe Tower of Gondor is held worthy in the City, and such men have honour in \\nthe land.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then it is far beyond me,\\' said Pippin. \\'Take me back to our room, and \\nif Gandalf is not there, I will go where you like - as your guest.\\' \\n\\nGandalf was not in the lodging and had sent no message; so Pippin went \\nwith Beregond and was made known to the men of the Third Company. And \\nit \\n\\nseemed that Beregond got as much honour from it as his guest, for Pippin was \\nvery welcome. There had already been much talk in the citadel about \\nMithrandir\\'s companion and his long closeting with the Lord; and rumour \\ndeclared that a Prince of the Halflings had come out of the North to offer \\nallegiance to Gondor and five thousand swords. And some said that when the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRiders came from Rohan each would bring behind him a halfling warrior, small \\nmaybe, but doughty. \\n\\nThough Pippin had regretfully to destroy this hopeful tale, he could \\nnot be rid of his new rank, only fitting, men thought, to one befriended by \\nBoromir and honoured by the Lord Denethor; and they thanked him for \\ncoming \\n\\namong them, and hung on his words and stories of the outlands, and gave him \\nas much food and ale as he could wish. Indeed his only trouble was to be \\n\\'wary\\' according to the counsel of Gandalf, and not to let his tongue wag \\nfreely after the manner of a hobbit among friends. \\n\\nAt length Beregond rose. \\'Farewell for this time!\\' he said. \\'I have \\nduty now till sundown, as have all the others here, I think. But if you are \\nlonely, as you say, maybe you would like a merry guide about the City. My \\nson would go with you gladly. A good lad, I may say. If that pleases you, go \\ndown to the lowest circle and ask for the Old Guesthouse in the Rath \\nCelerdain, the Lamp wrights\\' Street. You will find him there with other lads \\nthat are remaining in the City. There may be things worth seeing down at the \\nGreat Gate ere the closing.\\' \\n\\nHe went out, and soon after all the others followed. The day was still \\nfine, though it was growing hazy, and it was hot for March, even so far \\nsouthwards. Pippin felt sleepy, but the lodging seemed cheerless, and he \\ndecided to go down and explore the City. He took a few morsels that he had \\nsaved to Shadowfax, and they were graciously accepted, though the horse \\nseemed to have no lack. Then he walked on down many winding ways. \\n\\nPeople stared much as he passed. To his face men were gravely \\ncourteous, saluting him after the manner of Gondor with bowed head and hands \\nupon the breast; but behind him he heard many calls, as those out of doors \\ncried to others within to come and see the Prince of the Halflings, the \\ncompanion of Mithrandir. Many used some other tongue than the Common \\nSpeech, \\n\\nbut it was not long before he learned at least what was meant by Emil i \\nPheriannath and knew that his title had gone down before him into the City. \\n\\nHe came at last by arched streets and many fair alleys and pavements to \\nthe lowest and widest circle, and there he was directed to the Lampwrights\\' \\nStreet, a broad way running towards the Great Gate. In it he found the Old \\nGuesthouse, a large building of grey weathered stone with two wings running \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nback from the street, and between them a narrow greensward, behind which \\nwas \\n\\nthe many-windowed house, fronted along its whole width by a pillared porch \\nand a flight of steps down on to the grass. Boys were playing among the \\npillars, the only children that Pippin had seen in Minas Tirith, and he \\nstopped to look at them. Presently one of them caught sight of him, and with \\na shout he sprang across the grass and came into the street, followed by \\nseveral others. There he stood in front of Pippin, looking him up and down. \\n\\n\\'Greetings!\\' said the lad. \\'Where do you come from? You are a stranger \\nin the City.\\' \\n\\n\\'I was,\\' said Pippin; \\'but they say I have become a man of Gondor.\\' \\n\\n\\'Oh come!\\' said the lad. \\'Then we are all men here. But how old are \\nyou, and what is your name? I am ten years already, and shall soon be five \\nfeet. I am taller than you. But then my father is a Guard, one of the \\ntallest. What is your father?\\' \\n\\n\\'Which question shall I answer first?\\' said Pippin. \\'My father farms \\nthe lands round Whitwell near Tuckborough in the Shire. I am nearly \\ntwenty-nine, so I pass you there; though I am but four feet, and not likely \\nto grow any more, save sideways.\\' \\n\\n\\'Twenty-nine!\\' said the lad and whistled. \\'Why, you are quite old! As \\nold as my uncle Iorlas. Still,\\' he added hopefully, \\'I wager I could stand \\nyou on your head or lay you on your back.\\' \\n\\n\\'Maybe you could, if I let you,\\' said Pippin with a laugh. \\'And maybe I \\ncould do the same to you: we know some wrestling tricks in my little \\ncountry. Where, let me tell you, I am considered uncommonly large and \\nstrong; and I have never allowed anyone to stand me on my head. So if it \\ncame to a trial and nothing else would serve, I might have to kill you. For \\nwhen you are older, you will learn that folk are not always what they seem; \\nand though you may have taken me for a soft stranger -lad and easy prey, let \\nme warn you: I am not, I amahalfling, hard, bold, and wicked!\\' Pippin \\npulled such a grim face that the boy stepped back a pace, but at once he \\nreturned with clenched fists and the light of battle in his eye. \\n\\n\\'No!\\' Pippin laughed. \\'Don\\'t believe what strangers say of themselves \\neither! I am not a fighter. But it would be politer in any case for the \\nchallenger to say who he is.\\' \\n\\nThe boy drew himself up proudly. \\'I am Bergil son of Beregond of the \\nGuards,\\' he said. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'So I thought,\\' said Pippin, \\'for you look like your father. I know him \\nand he sent me to find you.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then why did you not say so at once?\\' said Bergil, and suddenly a look \\nof dismay came over his face. \\'Do not tell me that he has changed his mind, \\nand will send me away with the maidens! But no, the last wains have gone.\\' \\n\\n\\'His message is less bad than that, if not good.\\' said Pippin. \\'He says \\nthat if you would prefer it to standing me on my head, you might show me \\nround the City for a while and cheer my loneliness. I can tell you some \\ntales of far countries in return.\\' \\n\\nBergil clapped his hands, and laughed with relief. \\'All is well,\\' he \\ncried. \\'Come then! We were soon going to the Gate to look on. We will go \\nnow.\\' \\n\\n\\'What is happening there?\\' \\n\\n\\'The Captains of the Outlands are expected up the South Road ere \\nsundown. Come with us and you will see.\\' \\n\\nBergil proved a good comrade, the best company Pippin had had since he \\nparted from Merry, and soon they were laughing and talking gaily as they \\nwent about the streets, heedless of the many glances that men gave them. \\nBefore long they found themselves in a throng going towards the Great Gate. \\nThere Pippin went up much in the esteem of Bergil, for when he spoke his \\nname and the pass-word the guard saluted him and let him pass through; and \\nwhat was more, he allowed him to take his companion with him. \\n\\n\\'That is good!\\' said Bergil. \\'We boys are no longer allowed to pass the \\nGate without an elder. Now we shall see better.\\' \\n\\nBeyond the Gate there was a crowd of men along the verge of the road \\nand of the great paved space into which all the ways to Minas Tirith ran. \\n\\nAll eyes were turned southwards, and soon a murmur rose: \\'There is dust away \\nthere! They are coming!\\' \\n\\nPippin and Bergil edged their way forward to the front of the crowd, \\nand waited. Horns sounded at some distance, and the noise of cheering rolled \\ntowards them like a gathering wind. Then there was a loud trumpet-blast, and \\nall about them people were shouting. \\n\\n\\'Forlong! Forlong!\\' Pippin heard men calling. \\'What do they say?\\' he \\nasked. \\n\\n\\'Forlong has come,\\' Bergil answered; \\'old Forlong the Fat, the Lord of \\nLossarnach. That is where my grandsire lives. Hurrah! Here he is. Good old \\nForlong!\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeading the line there came walking a big thick -limbed horse, and on it \\nsat a man of wide shoulders and huge girth, but old and grey -bearded, yet \\nmail-clad and black-helmed and bearing a long heavy spear. Behind him \\nmarched proudly a dusty line of men, well-armed and bearing great \\nbattle-axes; grim-faced they were, and shorter and somewhat swarthier than \\nany men that Pippin had yet seen in Gondor. \\n\\n\\'Forlong!\\' men shouted. \\'True heart, true friend! Forlong!\\' But when \\nthe men of Lossarnach had passed they muttered: \\'So few! Two hundreds, \\nwhat \\n\\nare they? We hoped for ten times the number. That will be the new tidings of \\nthe black fleet. They are sparing only a tithe of their strength. Still \\nevery little is a gain.\\' \\n\\nAnd so the companies came and were hailed and cheered and passed \\nthrough the Gate, men of the Outlands marching to defend the City of Gondor \\nin a dark hour; but always too few, always less than hope looked for or need \\nasked. The men of Ringlu Vale behind the son of their lord, Dervorin \\nstriding on foot: three hundreds. From the uplands of Morthond, the great \\nBlackroot Vale, tall Duinhir with his sons, Duilin and Derufin, and five \\nhundred bowmen. From the Anfalas, the Langstrand far away, a long line of \\nmen of many sorts, hunters and herdsmen and men of little villages, scantily \\nequipped save for the household of Golasgil their lord. From Lamedon, a few \\ngrim hillmen without a captain. Fisher-folk of the Ethir, some hundred or \\nmore spared from the ships. Hirluin the Fair of the Green Hills from Pinnath \\nGelin with three hundreds of gallant green-clad men. And last and proudest, \\nImrahil, Prince of Dol Amroth, kinsman of the Lord, with gilded banners \\nbearing his token of the Ship and the Silver Swan, and a company of knights \\nin full harness riding grey horses; and behind them seven hundreds of men at \\narms, tall as lords, grey-eyed, dark-haired, singing as they came. \\n\\nAnd that was all, less than three thousands full told. No more would \\ncome. Their cries and the tramp of their feet passed into the City and died \\naway. The onlookers stood silent for a while. Dust hung in the air, for the \\nwind had died and the evening was heavy. Already the closing hour was \\ndrawing nigh, and the red sun had gone behind Mindolluin. Shadow came \\ndown \\n\\non the City. \\n\\nPippin looked up, and it seemed to him that the sky had grown \\nashen-grey, as if a vast dust and smoke hung above them, and light came \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndully through it. But in the West the dying sun had set all the fume on \\nfire, and now Mindolluin stood black against a burning smoulder flecked with \\nembers. \\'So ends a fair day in wrath!\\' he said forgetful of the lad at his \\nside. \\n\\n\\'So it will, if I have not returned before the sundown-bells,\\' said \\nBergil. \\'Come! There goes the trumpet for the closing of the Gate.\\' \\n\\nHand in hand they went back into the City, the last to pass the Gate \\nbefore it was shut; and as they reached the Lampwrights\\' Street all the \\nbells in the towers tolled solemnly. Lights sprang in many windows, and from \\nthe houses and wards of the men at arms along the walls there came the sound \\nof song. \\n\\n\\'Farewell for this time,\\' said Bergil. \\'Take my greetings to my \\nifather, and thank him for the company that he sent. Come again soon, I beg. \\nAlmost I wish now that there was no war, for we might have had some merry \\ntimes. We might have journeyed to Lossarnach, to my grandsire\\'s house; it is \\ngood to be there in Spring, the woods and fields are full of flowers. But \\nmaybe we will go thither together yet. They will never overcome our Lord, \\nand my father is very valiant. Farewell and return!\\' \\n\\nThey parted and Pippin hurried back towards the citadel. It seemed a \\nlong way, and he grew hot and very hungry; and night closed down swift and \\ndark. Not a star pricked the sky. He was late for the daymeal in the mess, \\nand Beregond greeted him gladly, and sat him at his side to hear news of his \\nson. After the meal Pippin stayed a while, and then took his leave, for a \\nstrange gloom was on him, and now he desired very much to see Gandalf \\nagain. \\n\\n\\'Can you find your way?\\' said Beregond at the door of the small hall, \\non the north side of the citadel, where they had sat. \\'It is a black night, \\nand all the blacker since orders came that lights are to be dimmed within \\nthe City, and none are to shine out from the walls. And I can give you news \\nof another order: you will be summoned to the Lord Denethor early tomorrow. \\nI fear you will not be for the Third Company. Still we may hope to meet \\nagain. Farewell and sleep in peace!\\' \\n\\nThe lodging was dark, save for a little lantern set on the table. \\n\\nGandalf was not there. Gloom settled still more heavily on Pippin. He \\nclimbed on the bench and tried to peer out of a window, but it was like \\nlooking into a pool of ink. He got down and closed the shutter and went to \\nbed. For a while he lay and listened for sounds of Gandalf s return, and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthen he fell into an uneasy sleep. \\n\\nIn the night he was wakened by a light, and he saw that Gandalf had \\ncome and was pacing to and fro in the room beyond the curtain of the alcove. \\nThere were candles on the table and rolls of parchment. He heard the wizard \\nsigh, and mutter: \\'When will Faramir return?\\' \\n\\n\\'Hullo!\\' said Pippin, poking his head round the curtain. \\'I thought you \\nhad forgotten all about me. I am glad to see you back. It has been a long \\nday.\\' \\n\\n\\'But the night will be too short,\\' said Gandalf. \\'I have come back \\nhere, for I must have a little peace, alone. You should sleep, in a bed \\nwhile you still may. At the sunrise I shall take you to the Lord Denethor \\nagain. No, when the summons comes, not at sunrise. The Darkness has begun. \\nThere will be no dawn.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 2. The Passing of the Grey Company \\n\\n\\n\\nGandalf was gone, and the thudding hoofs of Shadowfax were lost in the \\nnight, when Merry came back to Aragorn. He had only a light bundle, for he \\nhad lost his pack at Parth Galen, and all he had was a few useful things he \\nhad picked up among the wreckage of Isengard. Hasufel was already saddled. \\nLegolas and Gimli with their horse stood close by. \\n\\n\\'So four of the Company still remain,\\' said Aragorn. \\'We will ride on \\ntogether. But we shall not go alone, as I thought. The king is now \\ndetermined to set out at once. Since the coming of the winged shadow, he \\ndesires to return to the hills under cover of night.\\' \\n\\n\\'And then whither?\\' said Legolas. \\n\\n\\'I cannot say yet,\\' Aragorn answered. \\'As for the king, he will go to \\nthe muster that he commanded at Edoras, four nights from now. And there, I \\nthink, he will hear tidings of war, and the Riders of Rohan will go down to \\nMinas Tirith. But for myself, and any that will go with me . . .\\' \\n\\n\\'I for one!\\' cried Legolas. \\'And Gimli with him!\\' said the Dwarf. \\n\\n\\'Well, for myself,\\' said Aragorn, \\'it is dark before me. I must go down \\nalso to Minas Tirith, but I do not yet see the road. An hour long prepared \\napproaches.\\' \\n\\n\\'Don\\'t leave me behind!\\' said Merry. \\'I have not been of much use yet; \\nbut I don\\'t want to be laid aside, like baggage to be called for when all is \\nover. I don\\'t think the Riders will want to be bothered with me now. Though, \\nof course, the king did say that I was to sit by him when he came to his \\nhouse and tell him all about the Shire.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Aragorn, \\'and your road lies with him, I think, Merry. But \\ndo not look for mirth at the ending. It will be long, I fear, ere Thjoden \\nsits at ease again in Meduseld. Many hopes will wither in this bitter \\nSpring.\\' \\n\\nSoon all were ready to depart: twenty-four horses, with Gimli behind \\nLegolas, and Merry in front of Aragorn. Presently they were riding swiftly \\nthrough the night. They had not long passed the mounds at the Fords of Isen, \\nwhen a Rider galloped up from the rear of their line. \\n\\n\\'My lord,\\' he said to the king, \\'there are horsemen behind us. As we \\ncrossed the fords I thought that I heard them. Now we are sure. They are \\n\\n\\n\\n\\novertaking us, riding hard.\\' \\n\\nThjoden at once called a halt. The Riders turned about and seized their \\nspears. Aragorn dismounted and set Merry on the ground, and drawing his \\nsword he stood by the king\\'s stirrup. Jomer and his esquire rode back to the \\nrear. Merry felt more like unneeded baggage than ever, and he wondered, if \\nthere was a fight, what he should do. Supposing the king\\'s small escort was \\ntrapped and overcome, but he escaped into the darkness - alone in the wild \\nfields of Rohan with no idea of where he was in all the endless miles? \\'No \\ngood!\\' he thought. He drew his sword and tightened his belt. \\n\\nThe sinking moon was obscured by a great sailing cloud, but suddenly it \\nrode out clear again. Then they all heard the sound of hoofs, and at the \\nsame moment they saw dark shapes coming swiftly on the path from the fords. \\nThe moonlight glinted here and there on the points of spears. The number of \\nthe pursuers could not be told, but they seemed no fewer than the king\\'s \\nescort, at the least. \\n\\nWhen they were some fifty paces off, Jomer cried in a loud voice: \\n\\n\\'Halt! Halt! Who rides in Rohan?\\' \\n\\nThe pursuers brought their steeds to a sudden stand. A silence \\nfollowed: and then in the moonlight, a horseman could be seen dismounting \\nand walking slowly forward. His hand showed white as he held it up, palm \\noutward, in token of peace; but the king\\'s men gripped their weapons. At ten \\npaces the man stopped. He was tall, a dark standing shadow. Then his clear \\nvoice rang out. \\n\\n\\'Rohan? Rohan did you say? That is a glad word. We seek that land in \\nhaste from long afar.\\' \\n\\n\\'You have found it,\\' said Jomer. \\'When you crossed the fords yonder you \\nentered it. But it is the realm of Thjoden the King. None ride here save by \\nhis leave. Who are you? And what is your haste?\\' \\n\\n\\'Halbarad D(r)nadan, Ranger of the North I am,\\' cried the man. \\'We seek \\none Aragorn son of Arathorn, and we heard that he was in Rohan.\\' \\n\\n\\'And you have found him also!\\' cried Aragorn. Giving his reins to \\nMerry, he ran forward and embraced the newcomer. \\'Halbarad!\\' he said. \\'Of \\nall joys this is the least expected!\\' \\n\\nMerry breathed a sigh of relief. He had thought that this was some last \\ntrick of Saruman\\'s, to waylay the king while he had only a few men about \\nhim; but it seemed that there would be no need to die in Thjoden\\'s defence, \\nnot yet at any rate. He sheathed his sword. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'All is well,\\' said Aragorn, turning back. \\'Here are some of my own kin \\nfrom the far land where I dwelt. But why they come, and how many they be, \\nHalbarad shall tell us.\\' \\n\\n\\'I have thirty with me,\\' said Halbarad. \\'That is all of our kindred \\nthat could be gathered in haste; but the brethren Elladan and Elrohir have \\nridden with us, desiring to go to the war. We rode as swiftly as we might \\nwhen your summons came.\\' \\n\\n\\'But I did not summon you,\\' said Aragorn, \\'save only in wish. My \\nthoughts have often turned to you, and seldom more than tonight; yet I have \\nsent no word. But come! All such matters must wait. You find us riding in \\nhaste and danger. Ride with us now, if the king will give his leave.\\' \\n\\nThjoden was indeed glad of the news. \\'It is well!\\' he said. \\'If these \\nkinsmen be in any way like to yourself, my lord Aragorn, thirty such knights \\nwill be a strength that cannot be counted by heads.\\' \\n\\nThen the Riders set out again, and Aragorn for a while rode with the \\nD(r)nedain; and when they had spoken of tidings in the North and in the South, \\nElrohir said to him: \\n\\n\\'I bring word to you from my father: The days are short. If thou art in \\nhaste, remember the Paths of the Dead.\\' \\n\\n\\'Always my days have seemed to me too short to achieve my desire,\\' \\nanswered Aragorn. \\'But great indeed will be my haste ere I take that road.\\' \\n\\n\\'That will soon be seen,\\' said Elrohir. \\'But let us speak no more of \\nthese things upon the open road!\\' \\n\\nAnd Aragorn said to Halbarad: \\'What is that that you bear, kinsman?\\' \\n\\nFor he saw that instead of a spear he bore a tall staff, as it were a \\nstandard, but it was close-furled in a black cloth bound about with many \\nthongs. \\n\\n\\'It is a gift that I bring you from the Lady of Rivendell,\\' answered \\nHalbarad. \\'She wrought it in secret, and long was the making. But she also \\nsends word to you: The days now are short. Either our hope cometh, or all \\nhopes end. Therefore I send thee what I have made for thee. Fare well, \\nElfstone!\\' \\n\\nAnd Aragorn said: \\'Now I know what you bear. Bear it still for me a \\nwhile!\\' And he turned and looked away to the North under the great stars, \\nand then he fell silent and spoke no more while the night\\'s journey lasted. \\n\\nThe night was old and the East grey when they rode up at last from \\nDeeping-coomb and came back to the Hornburg. There they were to lie and rest \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfor a brief while and take counsel. \\n\\nMerry slept until he was roused by Legolas and Gimli. The Sun is \\nhigh,\\' said Legolas. \\'All others are up and doing. Come, Master Sluggard, \\nand look at this place while you may!\\' \\n\\n\\'There was a battle here three nights ago,\\' said Gimli, \\'and here \\nLegolas and I played a game that I won only by a single ore. Come and see \\nhow it was! And there are caves, Merry, caves of wonder! Shall we visit \\nthem, Legolas, do you think?\\' \\n\\n\\'Nay! There is no time,\\' said the Elf. \\'Do not spoil the wonder with \\nhaste! I have given you my word to return hither with you, if a day of peace \\nand freedom comes again. But it is now near to noon, and at that hour we \\neat, and then set out again, I hear.\\' \\n\\nMerry got up and yawned. His few hours\\' sleep had not been nearly \\nenough; he was tired and rather dismal. He missed Pippin, and felt that he \\nwas only a burden, while everybody was making plans for speed in a business \\nthat he did not fully understand. \\'Where is Aragorn?\\' he asked. \\n\\n\\'In a high chamber of the Burg,\\' said Legolas. \\'He has neither rested \\nnor slept, I think. He went thither some hours ago, saying that he must take \\nthought, and only his kinsman, Halbarad, went with him; but some dark doubt \\nor care sits on him.\\' \\n\\n\\'They are a strange company, these newcomers,\\' said Gimli. \\'Stout men \\nand lordly they are, and the Riders of Rohan look almost as boys beside \\nthem; for they are grim men of face, worn like weathered rocks for the most \\npart, even as Aragorn himself; and they are silent.\\' \\n\\n\\'But even as Aragorn they are courteous, if they break their silence.\\' \\nsaid Legolas. \\'And have you marked the brethren Elladan and Elrohir? Less \\nsombre is their gear than the others\\', and they are fair and gallant as \\nElven-lords; and that is not to be wondered at in the sons of Elrond of \\nRivendell.\\' \\n\\n\\'Why have they come? Have you heard?\\' asked Merry. He had now dressed, \\nand he flung his grey cloak about his shoulders; and the three passed out \\ntogether towards the ruined gate of the Burg. \\n\\n\\'They answered a summons, as you heard,\\' said Gimli. \\'Word came to \\nRivendell, they say: Aragorn has need of his kindred. Let the D(r)nedain ride \\nto him in Rohan! But whence this message came they are now in doubt. \\n\\nGandalf \\n\\nsent it, I would guess.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Nay, Galadriel,\\' said Legolas. \\'Did she not speak through Gandalf of \\nthe ride of the Grey Company from the North?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, you have it,\\' said Gimli. \\'The Lady of the Wood! She read many \\nhearts and desires. Now why did not we wish for some of our own kinsfolk, \\nLegolas?\\' \\n\\nLegolas stood before the gate and turned his bright eyes away north and \\neast, and his fair face was troubled. \\'I do not think that any would come,\\' \\nhe answered. \\'They have no need to ride to war; war already marches on their \\nown lands.\\' \\n\\nFor a while the three companions walked together, speaking of this and \\nthat turn of the battle, and they went down from the broken gate, and passed \\nthe mounds of the fallen on the greensward beside the road, until they stood \\non Helm\\'s Dike and looked into the Coomb. The Death Down already stood \\nthere, black and tall and stony, and the great trampling and scoring of the \\ngrass by the Huorns could be plainly seen. The Dunlendings and many men of \\nthe garrison of the Burg were at work on the Dike or in the fields and about \\nthe battered walls behind; yet all seemed strangely quiet: a weary valley \\nresting after a great storm. Soon they turned back and went to the midday \\nmeal in the hall of the Burg. \\n\\nThe king was already there, and as soon as they entered he called for \\nMerry and had a seat set for him at his side. \\'It is not as I would have \\nit,\\' said Thjoden; \\'for this is little like my fair house in Edoras. And \\nyour friend is gone, who should also be here. But it may be long ere we sit, \\nyou and I, at the high table in Meduseld; there will be no time for feasting \\nwhen I return thither. But come now! Eat and drink, and let us speak \\ntogether while we may. And then you shall ride with me.\\' \\n\\n\\'May I?\\' said Merry, surprised and delighted. \\'That would be splendid!\\' \\n\\nHe had never felt more grateful for any kindness in words. \\'I am afraid I am \\nonly in everybody\\'s way,\\' he stammered; \\'but I should like to do anything I \\ncould, you know.\\' \\n\\n\\'I doubt it not,\\' said the king. \\'I have had a good hill-pony made \\nready for you. He will bear you as swift as any horse by the roads that we \\nshall take. For I will ride from the Burg by mountain paths, not by the \\nplain, and so come to Edoras by way of Dunharrow where the Lady Jowyn \\nawaits \\n\\nme. You shall be my esquire, if you will. Is there gear of war in this \\nplace, Jomer, that my sword-thain could use?\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'There are no great weapon-hoards here, lord.\\' answered Jomer. \\'Maybe a \\nlight helm might be found to fit him; but we have no mail or sword for one \\nof his stature.\\' \\n\\n\\'I have a sword,\\' said Merry, climbing from his seat, and drawing from \\nits black sheath his small bright blade. Filled suddenly with love for this \\nold man, he knelt on one knee, and took his hand and kissed it. \\'May I lay \\nthe sword of Meriadoc of the Shire on your lap Thjoden King?\\' he cried. \\n\\'Receive my service, if you will!\\' \\n\\n\\'Gladly will I take it,\\' said the king; and laying his long old hands \\nupon the brown hair of the hobbit; he blessed him. \\'Rise now, Meriadoc, \\nesquire of Rohan of the household of Meduseld!\\' he said. \\'Take your sword \\nand bear it unto good fortune!\\' \\n\\n\\'As a father you shall be to me,\\' said Merry. \\n\\n\\'For a little while,\\' said Thjoden. \\n\\nThey talked then together as they ate, until presently Jomer spoke. \\'It \\nis near the hour that we set for our going, lord,\\' he said. \\'Shall I bid men \\nsound the horns? But where is Aragorn? His place is empty and he has not \\neaten.\\' \\n\\n\\'We will make ready to ride,\\' said Thjoden; \\'but let word be sent to \\nthe Lord Aragorn that the hour is nigh.\\' \\n\\nThe king with his guard and Merry at his side passed down from the gate \\nof the Burg to where the Riders were assembling on the green. Many were \\nalready mounted. It would be a great company; for the king was leaving only \\na small garrison in the Burg, and all who could be spared were riding to the \\nweapontake at Edoras. A thousand spears had indeed already ridden away at \\nnight; but still there would be some five hundred more to go with the king, \\nfor the most part men from the fields and dales of Westfold. \\n\\nA little apart the Rangers sat, silent, in an ordered company, armed \\nwith spear and bow and sword. They were clad in cloaks of dark grey, and \\ntheir hoods were cast now over helm and head. Their horses were strong and \\nof proud bearing, but rough-haired; and one stood there without a rider, \\nAragorn\\'s own horse that they had brought from the North; Roheryn was his \\nname. There was no gleam of stone or gold, nor any fair thing in all their \\ngear and harness: nor did their riders bear any badge or token, save only \\nthat each cloak was pinned upon the left shoulder by a brooch of silver \\nshaped like a rayed star. \\n\\nThe king mounted his horse, Snowmane, and Merry sat beside him on his \\n\\n\\n\\n\\npony: Stybba was his name. Presently Jomer came out from the gate, and with \\nhim was Aragorn, and Halbarad bearing the great staff close-furled in black, \\nand two tall men, neither young nor old So much alike were they, the sons of \\nElrond, that few could tell them apart: dark -haired, grey-eyed, and their \\nfaces elven-fair, clad alike in bright mail beneath cloaks of silver-grey. \\nBehind them walked Legolas and Gimli. But Merry had eyes only for \\nAragorn, \\n\\nso startling was the change that he saw in him, as if in one night many \\nyears had fallen on his head. Grim was his face, grey-hued and weary. \\n\\n\\'I am troubled in mind, lord,\\' he said, standing by the king\\'s horse. \\n\\n\\'I have heard strange words, and I see new perils far off. I have laboured \\nlong in thought, and now I fear that I must change my purpose. Tell me, \\nThjoden, you ride now to Dunharrow, how long will it be ere you come there?\\' \\n\\n\\'It is now a full hour past noon,\\' said Jomer. \\'Before the night of the \\nthird day from now we should come to the Hold. The Moon will then be one \\nnight past his full, and the muster that the king commanded will be held the \\nday after. More speed we cannot make, if the strength of Rohan is to be \\ngathered.\\' \\n\\nAragorn was silent for a moment. \\'Three days,\\' he murmured, \\'and the \\nmuster of Rohan will only be begun. But I see that it cannot now be \\nhastened.\\' He looked up, and it seemed that he had made some decision; his \\nface was less troubled. Then, by our leave, lord, I must take new counsel \\nfor myself and my kindred. We must ride our own road, and no longer in \\nsecret. For me the time of stealth has passed. I will ride east by the \\nswiftest way, and I will take the Paths of the Dead.\\' \\n\\n\\'The Paths of the Dead!\\' said Thjoden, and trembled. \\'Why do you speak \\nof them?\\' Jomer turned and gazed at Aragorn, and it seemed to Merry that the \\nfaces of the Riders that sat within hearing turned pale at the words. \\'If \\nthere be in truth such paths,\\' said Thjoden, \\'their gate is in Dunharrow; \\nbut no living man may pass it.\\' \\n\\n\\'Alas! Aragorn my friend!\\' said Jomer. \\'I had hoped that we should ride \\nto war together; but if you seek the Paths of the Dead, then our parting is \\ncome, and it is little likely that we shall ever meet again under the Sun.\\' \\n\\n\\'That road I will take, nonetheless,\\' said Aragorn. \\'But I say to you, \\n\\nJomer, that in battle we may yet meet again, though all the hosts of Mordor \\nshould stand between.\\' \\n\\n\\'You will do as you will, my lord Aragorn,\\' said Thjoden. \\'It is your \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndoom, maybe, to tread strange paths that others dare not. This parting \\ngrieves me, and my strength is lessened by it; but now I must take the \\nmountain-roads and delay no longer. Farewell!\\' \\n\\n\\'Farewell, lord!\\' said Aragorn. \\'Ride unto great renown! Farewell, \\n\\nMerry! I leave you in good hands, better than we hoped when we hunted the \\nores to Fangorn. Legolas and Gimli will still hunt with me, I hope; but we \\nshall not forget you.\\' \\n\\n\\'Good-bye!\\' said Merry. Fie could find no more to say. Fie felt very \\nsmall, and he was puzzled and depressed by all these gloomy words. More than \\never he missed the unquenchable cheerfulness of Pippin. The Riders were \\nready, and their horses were fidgeting; he wished they would start arid get \\nit over. \\n\\nNow Thjoden spoke to Jomer, and he lifted up his hand and cried aloud, \\nand with that word the Riders set forth. They rode over the Dike and down \\nthe Coomb, and then, turning swiftly eastwards, they took a path that \\nskirted the foothills for a mile or so, until bending south it passed back \\namong the hills and disappeared from view. Aragorn rode to the Dike and \\nwatched till the king\\'s men were far down the Coomb. Then he turned to \\nHalbarad. \\n\\n\\'There go three that I love, and the smallest not the least,\\' he said. \\n\\n\\'He knows not to what end he rides; yet if he knew, he still would go on.\\' \\n\\n\\'A little people, but of great worth are the Shire-folk,\\' said \\nHalbarad. \\'Little do they know of our long labour for the safekeeping of \\ntheir borders, and yet I grudge it not.\\' \\n\\n\\'And now our fates are woven together,\\' said Aragorn. \\'And yet, alas! \\nhere we must part. Well, I must eat a little, and then we also must hasten \\naway. Come, Legolas and Gimli! I must speak with you as I eat.\\' \\n\\nTogether they went back into the Burg; yet for some time Aragorn sat \\nsilent at the table in the hall, and the others waited for him to speak. \\n\\n\\'Come!\\' said Legolas at last. \\'Speak and be comforted, and shake off the \\nshadow! What has happened since we came back to this grim place in the grey \\nmorning?\\' \\n\\n\\'A struggle somewhat grimmer for my part than the battle of the \\nHornburg,\\' answered Aragorn. \\'I have looked in the Stone of Orthanc, my \\nfriends.\\' \\n\\n\\'You have looked in that accursed stone of wizardry!\\' exclaimed Gimli \\nwith fear and astonishment in his face. \\'Did you say aught to - him? Even \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGandalf feared that encounter.\\' \\n\\n\\'You forget to whom you speak,\\' said Aragorn sternly, and his eyes \\nglinted. \\'Did I not openly proclaim my title before the doors ofEdoras? \\n\\nWhat do you fear that I should say to him? Nay, Gimli,\\' he said in a softer \\nvoice, and the grimness left his face, and he looked like one who has \\nlaboured in sleepless pain for many nights. \\'Nay, my friends, I and the \\nlawful master of the Stone, and I had both the right and the strength to use \\nit, or so I judged. The right cannot be doubted. The strength was enough - \\nbarely.\\' \\n\\nHe drew a deep breath. \\'It was a bitter struggle, and the weariness is \\nslow to pass. I spoke no word to him, and in the end I wrenched the Stone to \\nmy own will. That alone he will find hard to endure. And he beheld me. Yes, \\nMaster Gimli, he saw me, but in other guise than you see me here. If that \\nwill aid him, then I have done ill. But I do not think so. To know that I \\nlived and walked the earth was a blow to his heart, I deem; for he knew it \\nnot till now. The eyes in Orthanc did not see through the armour of Thjoden; \\nbut Sauron has not forgotten Isildur and the sword of Elendil. Now in the \\nvery hour of his great designs the heir of Isildur and the Sword are \\nrevealed; for 1 showed the blade re-forged to him. He is not so mighty yet \\nthat he is above fear; nay, doubt ever gnaws him.\\' \\n\\n\\'But he wields great dominion, nonetheless,\\' said Gimli; \\'and now he \\nwill strike more swiftly.\\' \\n\\n\\'The hasty stroke goes oft astray,\\' said Aragorn. \\'We must press our \\nEnemy, and no longer wait upon him for the move. See my friends, when I had \\nmastered the Stone, I learned many things. A grave peril I saw coming \\nunlooked-for upon Gondor from the South that will draw off great strength \\nfrom the defence of Minas Tirith. If it is not countered swiftly, I deem \\nthat the City will be lost ere ten days be gone.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then lost it must be,\\' said Gimli. \\'For what help is there to send \\nthither, and how could it come there in time?\\' \\n\\n\\'I have no help to send, therefore I must go myself,\\' said Aragorn. \\n\\n\\'But there is only one way through the mountains that will bring me to the \\ncoastlands before all is lost. That is the Paths of the Dead.\\' \\n\\n\\'The Paths of the Dead!\\' said Gimli. \\'It is a fell name; and little to \\nthe liking to the Men of Rohan, as I saw. Can the living use such a road and \\nnot perish? And even if you pass that way, what will so few avail to counter \\nthe strokes of Mordor?\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'The living have never used that road since the coming of the \\nRohirrim,\\' said Aragorn, \\'for it is closed to them. But in this dark hour \\nthe heir of Isildur may use it, if he dare. Listen! This is the word that \\nthe sons of Elrond bring to me from their father in Rivendell, wisest in \\nlore: Bid Aragorn remember the words of the seer, and the Paths of the \\nDead\\' \\n\\n\\'And what may be the words of the seer?\\' said Legolas. \\n\\n\"Thus spoke Malbeth the Seer, in the days of Arvedui, last king at \\nFornost,\\' said Aragorn: \\n\\nOver the land there lies a long shadow, \\nwestward reaching wings of darkness. \\n\\nThe Tower trembles; to the tombs of kings \\ndoom approaches. The Dead awaken; \\nfor the hour is come for the oathbreakers ; \\nat the Stone of Erech they shall stand again \\nand hear there a horn in the hills ringing. \\n\\nWhose shall the horn be? Who shall call them \\nfrom the prey twilight, the forgotten people? \\n\\nThe heir of him to whom the oath they swore. \\n\\nFrom the North shall he come, need shall drive him: \\nhe shall pass the Door to the Paths of the Dead. \\n\\n\\'Dark ways doubtless, said Gimli, but no darker than these staves are \\nto me.\\' \\n\\n\\'If you would understand them better, then I bid you come with me,\\' \\nsaid Aragorn; \\'for that way I now shall take. But I do not go gladly; only \\nneed drives me. Therefore, only of your free will would I have you come, for \\nyou will find both toil and great fear, and maybe worse.\\' \\n\\n\\'I will go with you even on the Paths of the Dead, and to whatever, end \\nthey may lead,\\' said Gimli. \\n\\n\\'I also will come,\\' said Legolas, \\'for I do not fear the Dead.\\' \\n\\n\\'I hope that the forgotten people will not have forgotten how to \\nfight,\\' said Gimli; \\'for otherwise I see not why we should trouble them.\\' \\n\\n\\'That we shall know if ever we come to Erech,\\' said Aragorn. \\'But the \\noath that they broke was to fight against Sauron, and they must fight \\ntherefore, if they are to fulfil it. For at Erech there stands yet a black \\nstone that was brought, it was said, from N(r)menor by Isildur; and it was set \\nupon a hill, and upon it the King of the Mountains swore allegiance to him \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nin the beginning of the realm of Gondor. But when Sauron returned and grew \\nin might again, Isildur summoned the Men of the Mountains to fulfil their \\noath, and they would not: for they had worshipped Sauron in the Dark Years. \\n\\n\\'Then Isildur said to their king: \"Thou shalt be the last king. And if \\nthe West prove mightier than thy Black Master, this curse I lay upon thee \\nand thy folk: to rest never until your oath is fulfilled. For this war will \\nlast through years uncounted, and you shall be summoned once again ere the \\nend.\" And they fled before the wrath of Isildur, and did not dare to go \\nforth to war on Sauron\\'s part; and they hid themselves in secret places in \\nthe mountains and had no dealings with other men, but slowly dwindled in the \\nbarren hills. And the terror of the Sleepless Dead lies about the Hill of \\nErech and all places where that people lingered. But that way I must go, \\nsince there are none living to help me.\\' \\n\\nHe stood up. \\'Come!\\' he cried, and drew his sword, and it flashed in \\nthe twilit hall of the Burg. \\'To the Stone of Erech! I seek the Paths of the \\nDead. Come with me who will!\\' \\n\\nLegolas and Gimli made no answer, but they rose and followed Aragorn \\nfrom the hall. On the green there waited, still and silent, the hooded \\nRangers. Legolas and Gimli mounted. Aragorn sprang upon Roheryn. \\n\\nThen \\n\\nHalbarad lifted a great horn, and the blast of it echoed in Helm\\'s Deep; and \\nwith that they leapt away, riding down the Coomb like thunder, while all the \\nmen that were left on Dike or Burg stared in amaze. \\n\\nAnd while Thjoden went by slow paths in the hills, the Grey Company \\npassed swiftly over the plain, and on the next day in the afternoon they \\ncame to Edoras; and there they halted only briefly, ere they passed up the \\nvalley, and so came to Dunharrow as darkness fell. \\n\\nThe Lady Jowyn greeted them and was glad of their coming; for no \\nmightier men had she seen than the D(r)nedain and the fair sons of Elrond; but \\non Aragorn most of all her eyes rested. And when they sat at supper with \\nher, they talked together, and she heard of all that had passed since \\nThjoden rode away, concerning which only hasty tidings had yet reached her; \\nand when she heard of the battle in Helm\\'s Deep and the great slaughter of \\ntheir foes, and of the charge of Thjoden and his knights, then her eyes \\nshone. \\n\\nBut at last she said: \\'Lords, you are weary and shall now go to your \\nbeds with such ease as can be contrived in haste. But tomorrow fairer \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhousing shall be found for you.\\' \\n\\nBut Aragorn said: \\'Nay, lady, be not troubled for us! If we may lie \\nhere tonight and break our fast tomorrow, it will be enough. For I ride on \\nan errand most urgent, and with the first light of morning we must go.\\' \\n\\nShe smiled on him and said: \\'Then it was kindly done, lord, to ride so \\nmany miles out of your way to bring tidings to Jowyn, and to speak with her \\nin her exile.\\' \\n\\n\\'Indeed no man would count such a journey wasted,\\' said Aragorn; \\'and \\nyet, lady, I could not have come hither, if it were not that the road which \\nI must take leads me to Dunharrow.\\' \\n\\nAnd she answered as one that likes not what is said: \"Then, lord, you \\nare astray; for out of Harrowdale no road runs east or south; and you had \\nbest return as you came.\\' \\n\\n\\'Nay, lady,\\' said he, \\'I am not astray; for I walked in this land ere \\nyou were born to grace it. There is a road out of this valley, and that road \\nI shall take. Tomorrow I shall ride by the Paths of the Dead.\\' \\n\\nThen she stared at him as one that is stricken, and her face blanched, \\nand for long she spoke no more, while all sat silent. \\'But, Aragorn,\\' she \\nsaid at last, \\'is it then your errand to seek death? For that is all that \\nyou will find on that road. They do not suffer the living to pass.\\' \\n\\n\\'They may suffer me to pass,\\' said Aragorn; \\'but at the least I will \\nadventure it. No other road will serve.\\' \\n\\n\\'But this is madness,\\' she said. \\'For here are men of renown and \\nprowess, whom you should not take into the shadows, but should lead to war, \\nwhere men are needed. I beg you to remain and ride with my brother; for then \\nall our hearts will be gladdened, and our hope be the brighter.\\' \\n\\n\\'It is not madness, lady,\\' he answered; \\'for I go on a path appointed. \\n\\nBut those who follow me do so of their free will; and if they wish now to \\nremain and ride with the Rohirrim, they may do so. But I shall take the \\nPaths of the Dead, alone, if needs be.\\' \\n\\nThen they said no more, and they ate in silence; but her eyes were ever \\nupon Aragorn, and the others saw that she was in great torment of mind. At \\nlength they arose, and took their leave of the Lady, and thanked her for her \\ncare, and went to their rest. \\n\\nBut as Aragorn came to the booth where he was to lodge with Legolas and \\nGimli, and his companions had gone in. there came the Lady Jowyn after him \\nand called to him. He turned and saw her as a glimmer in the night, for she \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwas clad in white; but her eyes were on fire. \\n\\n\\'Aragorn,\\' she said, \\'why will you go on this deadly road?\\' \\n\\n\\'Because I must,\\' he said. \\'Only so can I see any hope of doing my part \\nin the war against Sauron. I do not choose paths of peril, Jowyn. Were I to \\ngo where my heart dwells, far in the North I would now be wandering in the \\nfair valley of Rivendell.\\' \\n\\nFor a while she was silent, as if pondering what this might mean. Then \\nsuddenly she laid her hand on his arm. \\'You are a stern lord and resolute,\\' \\nshe said; \\'and thus do men win renown.\\' She paused. \\'Lord.\\' she said, \\'if \\nyou must go, then let me ride in your following. For I am weary of skulking \\nin the hills, and wish to face peril and battle.\\' \\n\\n\\'Your duty is with your people,\\' he answered. \\n\\n\\'Too often have I heard of duty,\\' she cried. \\'But am I not of the House \\nof Eorl, a shieldmaiden and not a dry-nurse? I have waited on faltering feet \\nlong enough. Since they falter no longer, it seems, may I not now spend my \\nlife as I will?\\' \\n\\n\\'Few may do that with honour,\\' he answered. \\'But as for you, lady: did \\nyou not accept the charge to govern the people until their lord\\'s return? If \\nyou had not been chosen, then some marshal or captain would have been set in \\nthe same place, and he could not ride away from his charge, were he weary of \\nit or no.\\' \\n\\n\\'Shall I always be chosen?\\' she said bitterly. \\'Shall I always be left \\nbehind when the Riders depart, to mind the house while they win renown, and \\nfind food and beds when they return?\\' \\n\\n\\'A time may come soon,\\' said he, \\'when none will return. Then there \\nwill be need of valour without renown, for none shall remember the deeds \\nthat are done in the last defence of your homes. Yet the deeds will not be \\nless valiant because they are unpraised.\\' \\n\\nAnd she answered: \\'All your words are but to say: you are a woman, and \\nyour part is in the house. But when the men have died in battle and honour, \\nyou have leave to be burned in the house, for the men will need it no more. \\nBut I am of the House of Eorl and not a serving-woman. I can ride and wield \\nblade, and I do not fear either pain or death.\\' \\n\\n\\'What do you fear, lady?\\' he asked. \\n\\n\\'A cage,\\' she said. \\'To stay behind bars, until use and old age accept \\nthem, and all chance of doing great deeds is gone beyond recall or desire.\\' \\n\\n\\'And yet you counselled me not to adventure on the road that I had \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchosen, because it is perilous?\\' \\n\\n\\'So may one counsel another,\\' she said. \\'Yet I do not bid you flee from \\nperil, but to ride to battle where your sword may win renown and victory. I \\nwould not see a thing that is high and excellent cast away needlessly.\\' \\n\\n\\'Nor would I,\\' he said. \\'Therefore I say to you, lady: Stay! For you \\nhave no errand to the South.\\' \\n\\n\\'Neither have those others who go with thee. They go only because they \\nwould not be parted from thee - because they love thee.\\' Then she turned and \\nvanished into the night. \\n\\nWhen the light of day was come into the sky but the sun was not yet \\nrisen above the high ridges in the East, Aragorn made ready to depart. His \\ncompany was all mounted, and he was about to leap into the saddle, when the \\nLady Jowyn came to bid them farewell. She was clad as a Rider and girt with \\na sword. In her hand she bore a cup, and she set it to her lips and drank a \\nlittle, wishing them good speed; and then she gave the cup to Aragorn, and \\nhe drank, and he said: \\'Farewell, Lady of Rohan! I drink to the fortunes of \\nyour House, and of you, and of all your people. Say to your brother: beyond \\nthe shadows we may meet again!\\' \\n\\nThen it seemed to Gimli and Legolas who were nearby that she wept, and \\nin one so stern and proud that seemed the more grievous. But she said: \\n\\'Aragorn, wilt thou go?\\' \\n\\n\\'I will,\\' he said. \\n\\n\\'Then wilt thou not let me ride with this company, as I have asked?\\' \\n\\n\\'I will not, lady,\\' he said. \\'For that I could not grant without leave \\nof the king and of your brother; and they will not return until tomorrow. \\n\\nBut I count now every hour, indeed every minute. Farewell!\\' \\n\\nThen she fell on her knees, saying: \\'I beg thee!\\' \\n\\n\\'Nay, lady,\\' he said, and taking her by the hand he raised her. Then he \\nkissed her hand, and sprang into the saddle, and rode away, and did not look \\nback; and only those who knew him well and were near to him saw the pain \\nthat he bore. \\n\\nBut Jowyn stood still as a figure carven in stone, her hands clenched \\nat her sides, and she watched them until they passed into the shadows under \\nthe black Dwimorberg, the Haunted Mountain, in which was the Gate of the \\nDead. When they were lost to view, she turned, stumbling as one that is \\nblind, and went back to her lodging. But none of her folk saw this parting, \\nfor they hid themselves in fear and would not come forth until the day was \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nup, and the reckless strangers were gone. \\n\\nAnd some said: \\'They are Elvish wights. Let them go where they belong, \\ninto the dark places, and never return. The times are evil enough.\\' \\n\\nThe light was still grey as they rode, for the sun had not yet climbed \\nover the black ridges of the Haunted Mountain before them. A dread fell on \\nthem, even as they passed between the lines of ancient stones and so came to \\nthe Dimholt. There under the gloom of black trees that not even Legolas \\ncould long endure they found a hollow place opening at the mountain\\'s root, \\nand right in their path stood a single mighty stone like a finger of doom. \\n\\n\\'My blood runs chill,\\' said Gimli, but the others were silent, and his \\nvoice fell dead on the dank fir-needles at his feet. The horses would not \\npass the threatening stone, until the riders dismounted and led them about. \\nAnd so they came at last deep into the glen; and there stood a sheer wall of \\nrock, and in the wall the Dark Door gaped before them like the mouth of \\nnight. Signs and figures were carved above its wide arch too dim to read, \\nand fear flowed from it like a grey vapour. \\n\\nThe company halted, and there was not a heart among them that did not \\nquail, unless it were the heart of Legolas of the Elves, for whom the ghosts \\nof Men have no terror. \\n\\n\\'This is an evil door,\\' said Halbarad, \\'and my death lies beyond it. I \\nwill dare to pass it nonetheless; but no horse will enter.\\' \\n\\n\\'But we must go in, and therefore the horses must go too,\\' said \\nAragorn. \\'Lor if ever we come through this darkness, many leagues lie \\nbeyond, and every hour that is lost there will bring the triumph of Sauron \\nnearer. Lollow me!\\' \\n\\nThen Aragorn led the way, and such was the strength of his will in that \\nhour that all the D(r)nedain and their horses followed him. And indeed the \\nlove that the horses of the Rangers bore for their riders was so great that \\nthey were willing to face even the terror of the Door, if their masters\\' \\nhearts were steady as they walked beside them. But Arod, the horse of Rohan, \\nrefused the way, and he stood sweating and trembling in a fear that was \\ngrievous to see. Then Legolas laid his hands on his eyes and sang some words \\nthat went soft in the gloom, until he suffered himself to be led, and \\nLegolas passed in. And there stood Gimli the Dwarf left all alone. \\n\\nHis knees shook, and he was wroth with himself. \\'Here is a thing \\nunheard of!\\' he said. \\'An Elf will go underground and a Dwarf dare not!\\' \\nWith that he plunged in. But it seemed to him that he dragged his feet like \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nlead over the threshold; and at once a blindness came upon him, even upon \\nGimli Gluin\\'s son who had walked unafraid in many deep places of the world. \\n\\nAragorn had brought torches from Dunharrow, and now he went ahead \\nbearing one aloft; and Elladan with another went at the rear, and Gimli, \\nstumbling behind, strove to overtake him. He could see nothing but the dim \\nflame of the torches; but if the company halted, there seemed an endless \\nwhisper of voices all about him, a murmur of words in no tongue that he had \\never heard before. \\n\\nNothing assailed the company nor withstood their passage, and yet \\nsteadily fear grew on the Dwarf as he went on: most of all because he knew \\nnow that there could be no turning back; all the paths behind were thronged \\nby an unseen host that followed in the dark. \\n\\nSo time unreckoned passed, until Gimli saw a sight that he was ever \\nafterwards loth to recall. The road was wide, as far as he could judge, but \\nnow the company came suddenly into a great empty space, and there were no \\nlonger any walls upon either side. The dread was so heavy on him that he \\ncould hardly walk. Away to the left something glittered in the gloom as \\nAragorn\\'s torch drew near. Then Aragorn halted and went to look what it \\nmight be. \\n\\n\\'Does he feel no fear?\\' muttered the Dwarf. \\'In any other cave Gimli \\nGluin\\'s son would have been the first to run to the gleam of gold. But not \\nhere! Let it lie!\\' \\n\\nNonetheless he drew near, and saw Aragorn kneeling, while Elladan held \\naloft both torches. Before him were the bones of a mighty man. He had been \\nclad in mail, and still his harness lay there whole; for the cavern\\'s air \\nwas as dry as dust, and his hauberk was gilded. His belt was of gold and \\ngarnets, and rich with gold was the helm upon his bony head face downward on \\nthe floor. He had fallen near the far wall of the cave, as now could be \\nseen, and before him stood a stony door closed fast: his finger -bones were \\nstill clawing at the cracks. A notched and broken sword lay by him, as if he \\nhad hewn at the rock in his last despair. \\n\\nAragorn did not touch him, but after gazing silently for a while he \\nrose and sighed. \\'Hither shall the flowers of simbelmynl come never unto \\nworld\\'s end,\\' he murmured. \\'Nine mounds and seven there are now green with \\ngrass, and through all the long years he has lain at the door that he could \\nnot unlock. Whither does it lead? Why would he pass? None shall ever know! \\n\\n\\'For that is not my errand!\\' he cried, turning back and speaking to the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhispering darkness behind. \\'Keep your hoards and your secrets hidden in the \\nAccursed Years! Speed only we ask. Let us pass, and then come! I summon \\nyou \\n\\nto the Stone of Erech!\\' \\n\\nThere was no answer, unless it were an utter silence more dreadful than \\nthe whispers before; and then a chill blast came in which the torches \\nflickered and went out, and could not be rekindled. Of the time that \\nfollowed, one hour or many, Gimli remembered little. The others pressed on, \\nbut he was ever hindmost, pursued by a groping horror that seemed always \\njust about to seize him; and a rumour came after him like the shadow-sound \\nof many feet. He stumbled on until he was crawling like a beast on the \\nground and felt that he could endure no more: he must either find an ending \\nand escape or run back in madness to meet the following fear. \\n\\nSuddenly he heard the tinkle of water, a sound hard and clear as a \\nstone falling into a dream of dark shadow. Light grew, and lo! the company \\npassed through another gateway, high-arched and broad, and a rill ran out \\nbeside them; and beyond, going steeply down, was a road between sheer \\ncliffs, knife-edged against the sky far above. So deep and narrow was that \\nchasm that the sky was dark, and in it small stars glinted. Yet as Gimli \\nafter learned it was still two hours ere sunset of the day on which they had \\nset out from Dunharrow; though for all that he could then tell it might have \\nbeen twilight in some later year, or in some other world. \\n\\nThe Company now mounted again, and Gimli returned to Legolas. They \\nrode \\n\\nin file, and evening came on and a deep blue dusk; and still fear pursued \\nthem. Legolas turning to speak to Gimli looked back and the Dwarf saw before \\nhis face the glitter in the Elf s bright eyes. Behind them rode Elladan, \\nlast of the Company, but not the last of those that took the downward road. \\n\\nThe Dead are following,\\' said Legolas. \\'I see shapes of Men and of \\nhorses, and pale banners like shreds of cloud, and spears like \\nwinter-thickets on a misty night. The Dead are following.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, the Dead ride behind. They have been summoned,\\' said Elladan. \\n\\nThe Company came at last out of the ravine, as suddenly as it they had \\nissued from a crack in a wall; and there lay the uplands of a great vale \\nbefore them, and the stream beside them went down with a cold voice over \\nmany falls. \\n\\n\\'Where in Middle-earth are we?\\' said Gimli; and Elladan answered: \\'We \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhave descended from the uprising of the Morthond, the long chill river that \\nflows at last to the sea that washes the walls of Dol Amroth. You will not \\nneed to ask hereafter how comes its name: Blackroot men call it.\\' \\n\\nThe Morthond Vale made a great bay that beat up against the sheer \\nsouthern faces of the mountains. Its steep slopes were grass-grown; but all \\nwas grey in that hour, for the sun had gone, and far below lights twinkled \\nin the homes of Men. The vale was rich and many folk dwelt there. \\n\\nThen without turning Aragorn cried aloud so that all could hear: \\n\\'Friends, forget your weariness! Ride now, ride! We must come to the Stone \\nof Erech ere this day passes, and long still is the way.\\' So without looking \\nback they rode the mountain-fields, until they came to a bridge over the \\ngrowing torrent and found a road that went down into the land. \\n\\nLights went out in house and hamlet as they came, and doors were shut, \\nand folk that were afield cried in terror and ran wild like hunted deer. \\n\\nEver there rose the same cry in the gathering night: \\'The King of the Dead! \\nThe King of the Dead is come upon us!\\' \\n\\nBells were ringing far below, and all men fled before the face of \\nAragorn; but the Grey Company in their haste rode like hunters, until their \\nhorses were stumbling with weariness. And thus, just ere midnight, and in a \\ndarkness as black as the caverns in the mountains, they came at last to the \\nHill of Erech. \\n\\nLong had the terror of the Dead lain upon that hill and upon the empty \\nfields about it. For upon the top stood a black stone, round as a great \\nglobe, the height of a man, though its half was buried in the ground. \\nUnearthly it looked, as though it had fallen from the sky, as some believed; \\nbut those who remembered still the lore of Westernesse told that it had been \\nbrought out of the ruin of N(r)menor and there set by Isildur at his landing. \\nNone of the people of the valley dared to approach it, nor would they dwell \\nnear; for they said that it was a try sting -place of the Shadow-men, and \\nthere they would gather in times of fear, thronging round the Stone and \\nwhispering. \\n\\nTo that Stone the Company came and halted in the dead of night. Then \\nElrohir gave to Aragorn a silver horn, and he blew upon it and it seemed to \\nthose that stood near that they heard a sound of answering horns, as if it \\nwas an echo in deep caves far away. No other sound they heard, and yet they \\nwere aware of a great host gathered all about the hill on which they stood; \\nand a chill wind like the breath of ghosts came down from the mountains. But \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAragorn dismounted, and standing by the Stone he cried in a great voice: \\n\\n\\'Oathbreakers, why have ye come?\\' \\n\\nAnd a voice was heard out of the night that answered him, as if from \\nfar away: \\n\\n\\'To fulfil our oath and have peace.\\' \\n\\nThen Aragorn said: \\'The hour is come at last. Now I go to Pelargir upon \\nAnduin, and ye shall come after me. And when all this land is clean of the \\nservants of Sauron, I will hold the oath fulfilled, and ye shall have peace \\nand depart for ever. For I am Elessar, Isildur\\'s heir of Gondor.\\' \\n\\nAnd with that he bade Halbarad unfurl the great standard which he had \\nbrought; and behold! it was black, and if there was any device upon it, it \\nwas hidden in the darkness. Then there was silence, and not a whisper nor a \\nsigh was heard again all the long night. The Company camped beside the \\nStone, but they slept little, because of the dread of the Shadows that \\nhedged them round. \\n\\nBut when the dawn came, cold and pale, Aragorn rose at once, and he led \\nthe Company forth upon the journey of greatest haste and weariness that any \\namong them had known, save he alone, and only his will held them to go on. \\nNo other mortal Men could have endured it, none but the D(r)nedain of the \\nNorth, and with them Gimli the Dwarf and Legolas of the Elves. \\n\\nThey passed Tarlang\\'s Neck and came into Lamedon; and the Shadow \\nHost \\n\\npressed behind and fear went on before them, until they came to Calembel \\nupon Ciril, and the sun went down like blood behind Pinnath Gelin away in \\nthe West behind them. The township and the fords of Ciril they found \\ndeserted, for many men had gone away to war, and all that were left fled to \\nthe hills at the rumour of the coming of the King of the Dead. But the next \\nday there came no dawn, and the Grey Company passed on into the darkness \\nof \\n\\nthe Storm of Mordor and were lost to mortal sight; but the Dead followed \\nthem. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 3 . The Muster of Rohan \\n\\n\\n\\nNow all roads were running together to the East to meet the coming of \\nwar and the onset of the Shadow. And even as Pippin stood at the Great Gate \\nof the City and saw the Prince of Dol Amroth ride in with his banners, the \\nKing of Rohan came down out of the hills. \\n\\nDay was waning. In the last rays of the sun the Riders cast long \\npointed shadows that went on before them. Darkness had already crept beneath \\nthe murmuring fir-woods that clothed the steep mountain -sides. The king rode \\nnow slowly at the end of the day. Presently the path turned round a huge \\nbare shoulder of rock and plunged into the gloom of soft -sighing trees. \\nDown, down they went in a long winding file. When at last they came to the \\nbottom of the gorge they found that evening had fallen in the deep places. \\n\\nThe sun was gone. Twilight lay upon the waterfalls. \\n\\nAll day far below them a leaping stream had run down from the high pass \\nbehind, cleaving its narrow way between pine-clad walls; and now through a \\nstony gate it flowed out and passed into a wider vale. The Riders followed \\nit, and suddenly Harrowdale lay before them, loud with the noise of waters \\nin the evening. There the white Snowbourn, joined by the lesser stream, went \\nrushing, fuming on the stones, down to Edoras and the green hills and the \\nplains. Away to the right at the head of the great dale the mighty Starkhorn \\nloomed up above its vast buttresses swathed in cloud; but its jagged peak, \\nclothed in everlasting snow, gleamed far above the world, blue-shadowed upon \\nthe East, red-stained by the sunset in the West. \\n\\nMerry looked out in wonder upon this strange country, of which he had \\nheard many tales upon their long road. It was a skyless world, in which his \\neye; through dim gulfs of shadowy air, saw only ever-mounting slopes, great \\nwalls of stone behind great walls, and frowning precipices wreathed with \\nmist. He sat for a moment half dreaming, listening to the noise of water, \\nthe whisper of dark trees, the crack of stone, and the vast waiting silence \\nthat brooded behind all sound. He loved mountains, or he had loved the \\nthought of them marching on the edge of stories brought from far away; but \\nnow he was borne down by the insupportable weight of Middle-earth. He \\nlonged \\n\\nto shut out the immensity in a quiet room by a fire. \\n\\nHe was very tired, for though they had ridden slowly, they had ridden \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwith very little rest. Hour after hour for nearly three weary days he had \\njogged up and down, over passes, and through long dales, and across many \\nstreams. Sometimes where the way was broader he had ridden at the king\\'s \\nside, not noticing that many of the Riders smiled to see the two together: \\nthe hobbit on his little shaggy grey pony, and the Lord of Rohan on his \\ngreat white horse. Then he had talked to Thjoden, telling him about his home \\nand the doings of the Shire-folk, or listening in turn to tales of the Mark \\nand its mighty men of old. But most of the time, especially on this last \\nday, Merry had ridden by himself just behind the king, saying nothing, and \\ntrying to understand the slow sonorous speech of Rohan that he heard the men \\nbehind him using. It was a language in which there seemed to be many words \\nthat he knew, though spoken more richly and strongly than in the Shire, yet \\nhe could not piece the words together. At times some Rider would lift up his \\nclear voice in stirring song, and Merry felt his heart leap, though he did \\nnot know what it was about. \\n\\nAll the same he had been lonely, and never more so than now at the \\nday\\'s end. He wondered where in all this strange world Pippin had got to; \\nand what would become of Aragorn and Legolas and Gimli. Then suddenly \\nlike a \\n\\ncold touch on his heart he thought of Frodo and Sam. \\'I am forgetting them!\\' \\nhe said to himself reproachfully. \\'And yet they are more important than all \\nthe rest of us. And I came to help them; but now they must be hundreds of \\nmiles away, if they are still alive.\\' He shivered. \\n\\n\\'Harrowdale at last!\\' said Jomer. \\'Our journey is almost at an end.\\' \\n\\nThey halted. The paths out of the narrow gorge fell steeply. Only a glimpse, \\nas through a tall window, could be seen of the great valley in the gloaming \\nbelow. A single small light could be seen twinkling by the river. \\n\\n\\'This journey is over, maybe,\\' said Thjoden, \\'but I have far yet to go. \\n\\nLast night the moon was full, and in the morning I shall ride to Edoras to \\nthe gathering of the Mark.\\' \\n\\n\\'But if you would take my counsel,\\' said Jomer in a low voice, \\'you \\nwould then return hither, until the war is over, lost or won.\\' \\n\\nThjoden smiled. \\'Nay, my son, for so I will call you, speak not the \\nsoft words of Wormtongue in my old ears!\\' He drew himself up and looked \\nback \\n\\nat the long line of his men fading into the dusk behind. \\'Long years in the \\nspace of days it seems since I rode west; but never will I lean on a staff \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nagain. If the war is lost, what good will be my hiding in the hills? And if \\nit is won, what grief will it be, even if I fall, spending my last strength? \\n\\nBut we will leave this now. Tonight I will lie in the Hold of Dunharrow. One \\nevening of peace at least is left us. Let us ride on!\\' \\n\\nIn the deepening dusk they came down into the valley. Here the \\nSnowbourn flowed near to the western walls of the dale, and soon the path \\nled them to a ford where the shallow waters murmured loudly on the stones. \\nThe ford was guarded. As the king approached many men sprang up out of the \\nshadow of the rocks; and when they saw the king they cried with glad voices: \\n\\'Thjoden King! Thjoden King! The King of the Mark returns!\\' \\n\\nThen one blew a long call on a horn. It echoed in the valley. Other \\nhorns answered it, and lights shone out across the river. \\n\\nAnd suddenly there rose a great chorus of trumpets from high above, \\nsounding from some hollow place, as it seemed, that gathered their notes \\ninto one voice and sent it rolling and beating on the walls of stone. \\n\\nSo the King of the Mark came back victorious out of the West to \\nDunharrow beneath the feet of the White Mountains. There he found the \\nremaining strength of his people already assembled; for as soon as his \\ncoming was known captains rode to meet him at the ford, bearing messages \\nfrom Gandalf. D(r)nhere, chieftain of the folk of Harrowdale, was at their \\nhead. \\n\\n\\'At dawn three days ago, lord,\\' he said. \\'Shadowfax came like a wind \\nout of the West to Edoras, and Gandalf brought tidings of your victory to \\ngladden our hearts. But he brought also word from you to hasten the \\ngathering of the Riders. And then came the winged Shadow.\\' \\n\\n\\'The winged Shadow?\\' said Thjoden. \\'We saw it also, but that was in the \\ndead of night before Gandalf left us.\\' \\n\\n\\'Maybe, lord,\\' said D(r)nhere. \\'Yet the same, or another like to it, a \\nflying darkness in the shape of a monstrous bird, passed over Edoras that \\nmorning, and all men were shaken with fear. For it stooped upon Meduseld, \\nand as it came low, almost to the gable, there came a cry that stopped our \\nhearts. Then it was that Gandalf counselled us not to assemble in the \\nfields, but to meet you here in the valley under the mountains. And he bade \\nus to kindle no more lights or fires than barest need asked. So it has been \\ndone. Gandalf spoke with great authority. We trust that it is as you would \\nwish. Naught has been seen in Harrowdale of these evil things.\\' \\n\\n\\'It is well,\\' said Thjoden. \\'I will ride now to the Hold, and there \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbefore I go to rest I will meet the marshals and captains. Let them come to \\nme as soon as may be!\\' \\n\\nThe road now led eastward straight across the valley, which was at that \\npoint little more than half a mile in width. Flats and meads of rough grass, \\ngrey now in the falling night, lay all about, but in front on the far side \\nof the dale Merry saw a frowning wall, a last outlier of the great roots of \\nthe Starkhorn, cloven by the river in ages past. \\n\\nOn all the level spaces there was great concourse of men. Some thronged \\nto the roadside, hailing the king and the riders from the West with glad \\ncries; but stretching away into the distance behind there were ordered rows \\nof tents and booths, and lines of picketed horses, and great store of arms, \\nand piled spears bristling like thickets of new-planted trees. Now all the \\ngreat assembly was falling into shadow, and yet, though the night-chill blew \\ncold from the heights no lanterns glowed, no fires were lit. Watchmen \\nheavily cloaked paced to and fro. \\n\\nMerry wondered how many Riders there were. He could not guess their \\nnumber in the gathering gloom, but it looked to him like a great army, many \\nthousands strong. While he was peering from side to side the king\\'s party \\ncame up under the looming cliff on the eastern side of the valley; and there \\nsuddenly the path began to climb, and Merry looked up in amazement. He \\nwas \\n\\non a road the like of which he had never seen before, a great work of men\\'s \\nhands in years beyond the reach of song. Upwards it wound, coiling like a \\nsnake, boring its way across the sheer slope of rock. Steep as a stair, it \\nlooped backwards and forwards as it climbed. Up it horses could walk, and \\nwains could be slowly hauled; but no enemy could come that way, except out \\nof the air, if it was defended from above. At each turn of the road there \\nwere great standing stones that had been carved in the likeness of men, huge \\nand clumsy-limbed, squatting cross-legged with their stumpy arms folded on \\nfat bellies. Some in the wearing of the years had lost all features save the \\ndark holes of their eyes that still stared sadly at the passers-by. The \\nRiders hardly glanced at them. The P(r)kel-men they called them, and heeded \\nthem little: no power or terror was left in them; but Merry gazed at them \\nwith wonder and a feeling almost of pity, as they loomed up mournfully in \\nthe dusk. \\n\\nAfter a while he looked back and found that he had already climbed some \\nhundreds of feet above the valley, but still far below he could dimly see a \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwinding line of Riders crossing the ford and filing along the road towards \\nthe camp prepared for them. Only the king and his guard were going up into \\nthe Hold. \\n\\nAt last the king\\'s company came to a sharp brink, and the climbing road \\npassed into a cutting between walls of rock, and so went up a short slope \\nand out on to a wide upland. The Firienfeld men called it, a green \\nmountain-field of grass and heath, high above the deep -delved courses of the \\nSnowbourn, laid upon the lap of the great mountains behind: the Starkhorn \\nsouthwards, and northwards the saw-toothed mass of Irensaga, between which \\nthere faced the riders, the grim black wall of the Dwimorberg, the Haunted \\nMountain rising out of steep slopes of sombre pines. Dividing the upland \\ninto two there marched a double line of unshaped standing stones that \\ndwindled into the dusk and vanished in the trees. Those who dared to follow \\nthat road came soon to the black Dimholt under Dwimorberg, and the menace \\nof \\n\\nthe pillar of stone, and the yawning shadow of the forbidden door. \\n\\nSuch was the dark Dunharrow, the work of long -forgotten men. Their name \\nwas lost and no song or legend remembered it. For what purpose they had \\nmade \\n\\nthis place, as a town or secret temple or a tomb of kings, none could say. \\n\\nHere they laboured in the Dark Years, before ever a ship came to the western \\nshores, or Gondor of the D(r)nedain was built; and now they had vanished, and \\nonly the old P(r)kel-men were left, still sitting at the turnings of the road. \\n\\nMerry stared at the lines of marching stones: they were worn and black; \\nsome were leaning, some were fallen, some cracked or broken; they looked \\nlike rows of old and hungry teeth. He wondered what they could be, and he \\nhoped that the king was not going to follow them into the darkness beyond. \\nThen he saw that there were clusters of tents and booths on either side of \\nthe stony way; but these were not set near the trees, and seemed rather to \\nhuddle away from them towards the brink of the cliff. The greater number \\nwere on the right, where the Firienfeld was wider; and on the left there was \\na smaller camp, in the midst of which stood a tall pavilion. From this side \\na rider now came out to meet them, and they turned from the road. \\n\\nAs they drew near Merry saw that the rider was a woman with long \\nbraided hair gleaming in the twilight, yet she wore a helm and was clad to \\nthe waist like a warrior and girded with a sword. \\n\\n\\'Hail, Lord of the Mark!\\' she cried. \\'My heart is glad at your \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nreturning.\\' \\n\\n\\'And you, Jowyn,\\' said Thjoden, \\'is all well with you?\\' \\n\\n\\'All is well,\\' she answered; yet it seemed to Merry that her voice \\nbelied her, and he would have thought that she had been weeping, if that \\ncould be believed of one so stern of face. \\'All is well. It was a weary road \\nfor the people to take, torn suddenly from their homes. There were hard \\nwords, for it is long since war has driven us from the green fields; but \\nthere have been no evil deeds. All is now ordered, as you see. And your \\nlodging is prepared for you; for I have had full tidings of you and knew the \\nhour of your coming.\\' \\n\\n\\'So Aragorn has come then,\\' said Jomer. \\'Is he still here?\\' \\n\\n\\'No, he is gone,\\' said Jowyn turning away and looking at the mountains \\ndark against the East and South. \\n\\n\\'Whither did he go?\\' asked Jomer. \\n\\n\\'I do not know,\\' she answered. \\'He came at night, and rode away \\nyestermorn, ere the Sun had climbed over the mountain-tops. He is gone.\\' \\n\\n\\'You are grieved, daughter,\\' said Thjoden. \\'What has happened? Tell me, \\ndid he speak of that road?\\' He pointed away along the darkening lines of \\nstones towards the Dwimorberg. \\'Of the Paths of the Dead?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, lord,\\' said Jowyn. \\'And he has passed into the shadows from which \\nnone have returned. I could not dissuade him. He is gone.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then our paths are sundered,\\' said Jomer. \\'He is lost. We must ride \\nwithout him, and our hope dwindles.\\' \\n\\nSlowly they passed through the short heath and upland grass, speaking \\nno more, until they came to the king\\'s pavilion. There Merry found that \\neverything was made ready, and that he himself was not forgotten. A little \\ntent had been pitched for him beside the king\\'s lodging; and there he sat \\nalone, while men passed to and fro, going in to the king and taking counsel \\nwith him. Night came on, and the half-seen heads of the mountains westward \\nwere crowned with stars, but the East was dark and blank. The marching \\nstones faded slowly from sight, but still beyond them, blacker than the \\ngloom, brooded the vast crouching shadow of the Dwimorberg. \\n\\n\\'The Paths of the Dead,\\' he muttered to himself. \\'The Paths of the \\nDead? What does all this mean? They have all left me now. They have all gone \\nto some doom: Gandalf and Pippin to war in the East; and Sam and Frodo to \\nMordor; and Strider and Legolas and Gimli to the Paths of the Dead. But my \\nturn will come soon enough, I suppose. I wonder what they are all talking \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nabout, and what the king means to do. For I must go where he goes now.\\' \\n\\nIn the midst of these gloomy thoughts he suddenly remembered that he \\nwas very hungry, and he got up to go and see if anyone else in this strange \\ncamp felt the same. But at that very moment a trumpet sounded, and a man \\ncame summoning him, the king\\'s esquire, to wait at the king\\'s board. \\n\\nIn the inner part of the pavilion was a small space, curtained off with \\nbroidered hangings, and strewn with skins: and there at a small table sat \\nThjoden with Jomer and Jowyn, and D(r)nhere, lord of Harrowdale. Merry \\nstood \\n\\nbeside the king\\'s stool and waited on him till presently the old man, coming \\nout of deep thought, turned to him and smiled. \\n\\n\\'Come, Master Meriadoc!\\' he said. \\'You shall not stand. You shall sit \\nbeside me, as long as I remain in my own lands, and lighten my heart with \\ntales.\\' \\n\\nRoom was made for the hobbit at the king\\'s left hand, but no one called \\nfor any tale. There was indeed little speech, and they ate and drank for the \\nmost part in silence, until at last, plucking up courage, Merry asked the \\nquestion that was tormenting him. \\n\\n\\'Twice now, lord, I have heard of the Paths of the Dead,\\' he said. \\n\\n\\'What are they? And where has Strider, I mean the Lord Aragorn where has he \\ngone?\\' \\n\\nThe king sighed, but no one answered, until at last Jomer spoke. \\'We do \\nnot know, and our hearts are heavy,\\' he said. \\'But as for the Paths of the \\nDead, you have yourself walked on their first steps. Nay. I speak no words \\nof ill omen! The road that we have climbed is the approach to the Door, \\nyonder in the Dimholt. But what lies beyond no man knows.\\' \\n\\n\\'No man knows,\\' said Thjoden: \\'yet ancient legend, now seldom spoken, \\nhas somewhat to report. If these old tales speak true that have come down \\nfrom father to son in the House of Eorl, then the Door under Dwimorberg \\nleads to a secret way that goes beneath the mountain to some forgotten end. \\nBut none have ever ventured in to search its secrets, since Baldor, son of \\nBrego, passed the Door and was never seen among men again. A rash vow \\nhe \\n\\nspoke, as he drained the horn at that feast which Brego made to hallow \\nnew-built Meduseld, and he came never to the high seat of which he was the \\nheir. \\n\\n\\'Folk say that Dead Men out of the Dark Years guard the way and will \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsuffer no living man to come to their hidden halls; but at whiles they may \\nthemselves be seen passing out of the door like shadows and down the stony \\nroad. Then the people of Harrowdale shut fast their doors and shroud their \\nwindows and are afraid. But the Dead come seldom forth and only at times of \\ngreat unquiet and coming death.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yet it is said in Harrowdale,\\' said Jowyn in a low voice, \\'that in the \\nmoonless nights but little while ago a great host in strange array passed \\nby. Whence they came none knew, but they went up the stony road and \\nvanished \\n\\ninto the hill, as if they went to keep a tryst.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then why has Aragorn gone that way?\\' asked Merry. \\'Don\\'t you know \\nanything that would explain it?\\' \\n\\n\\'Unless he has spoken words to you as his friend that we have not \\nheard,\\' said Jomer, \\'none now in the land of the living can tell his \\npurpose.\\' \\n\\n\\'Greatly changed he seemed to me since I saw him first in the king\\'s \\nhouse,\\' said Jowyn: \\'grimmer, older. Fey I thought him, and like one whom \\nthe Dead call.\\' \\n\\n\\'Maybe he was called,\\' said Thjoden; \\'and my heart tells me that I \\nshall not see him again. Yet he is a kingly man of high destiny. And take \\ncomfort in this, daughter, since comfort you seem to need in your grief for \\nthis guest. It is said that when the Eorlingas came out of the North and \\npassed at length up the Snowbourn, seeking strong places of refuge in time \\nof need, Brego and his son Baldor climbed the Stair of the Hold and so came \\nbefore the Door. On the threshold sat an old man, aged beyond guess of \\nyears; tall and kingly he had been, but now he was withered as an old stone. \\nIndeed for stone they took him, for he moved not, and he said no word, until \\nthey sought to pass him by and enter. And then a voice came out of him, as \\nit were out of the ground, and to their amaze it spoke in the western \\ntongue: The way is shut. \\n\\n\\'Then they halted and looked at him and saw that he lived still; but he \\ndid not look at them. The way is shut, his voice said again It was made by \\nthose who are Dead, and the Dead keep it, until the time comes. The way is \\nshut. \\n\\n\\'And when will that time be? said Baldor. But no answer did he ever \\nget. For the old man died in that hour and fell upon his face; and no other \\ntidings of the ancient dwellers in the mountains have our folk ever learned. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYet maybe at last the time foretold has come, and Aragorn may pass.\\' \\n\\n\\'But how shall a man discover whether that time be come or no, save by \\ndaring the Door?\\' said Jomer. \\'And that way I would not go though all the \\nhosts of Mordor stood before me, and I were alone and had no other refuge. \\nAlas that a fey mood should fall on a man so greathearted in this hour of \\nneed! Are there not evil things enough abroad without seeking them under the \\nearth? War is at hand.\\' \\n\\nHe paused, for at that moment there was a noise outside, a man\\'s voice \\ncrying the name of Thjoden, and the challenge of the guard. \\n\\nPresently the captain of the Guard thrust aside the curtain. \\'A man is \\nhere, lord,\\' he said, \\'an errand-rider of Gondor. He wishes to come before \\nyou at once.\\' \\n\\n\\'Let him come!\\' said Thjoden. \\n\\nA tall man entered, and Merry choked back a cry; for a moment it seemed \\nto him that Boromir was alive again and had returned. Then he saw that it \\nwas not so; the man was a stranger, though as like to Boromir as if he were \\none of his kin, tall and grey-eyed and proud. He was clad as a rider with a \\ncloak of dark green over a coat of fine mail; on the front of his helm was \\nwrought a small silver star. In his hand he bore a single arrow, \\nblack-feathered and barbed with steel, but the point was painted red. \\n\\nHe sank on one knee and presented the arrow to Thjoden. \\'Hail Lord of \\nthe Rohirrim, friend of Gondor!\\' he said. \\'Hirgon I am, errand-rider of \\nDenethor, who bring you this token of war. Gondor is in great need. Often \\nthe Rohirrim have aided us, but now the Lord Denethor asks for all your \\nstrength and all your speed; lest Gondor fall at last.\\' \\n\\n\\'The Red Arrow!\\' said Thjoden, holding it, as one who receives a \\nsummons long expected and yet dreadful when it comes. His hand trembled. \\n\\'The Red Arrow has not been seen in the Mark in all my years ! Has it indeed \\ncome to that? And what does the Lord Denethor reckon that all my strength \\nand all my speed may be?\\' \\n\\n\\'That is best known to yourself, lord,\\' said Hirgon. \\'But ere long it \\nmay well come to pass that Minas Tirith is surrounded, and unless you have \\nthe strength to break a siege of many powers, the Lord Denethor bids me say \\nthat he judges that the strong arms of the Rohirrim would be better within \\nhis walls than without.\\' \\n\\n\\'But he knows that we are a people who fight rather upon horseback and \\nin the open, and that we are also a scattered people and time is needed for \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe gathering of our Riders. Is it not true, Hirgon, that the Lord of Minas \\nTirith knows more than he sets in his message? For we are already at war, as \\nyou may have seen, and you do not find us all unprepared. Gandalf the Grey \\nhas been among us, and even now we are mustering for battle in the East.\\' \\n\\n\\'What the Lord Denethor may know or guess of all these things I cannot \\nsay,\\' answered Hirgon. \\'But indeed our case is desperate. My lord does not \\nissue any command to you, he begs you only to remember old friendship and \\noaths long spoken, and for your own good to do all that you may. It is \\nreported to us that many kings have ridden in from the East to the service \\nof Mordor. From the North to the field of Dagorlad there is skirmish and \\nrumour of war. In the South the Haradrim are moving, and fear has fallen on \\nall our coastlands, so that little help will come to us thence. Make haste! \\n\\nFor it is before the walls of Minas Tirith that the doom of our time will be \\ndecided, and if the tide be not stemmed there, then it will flow over all \\nthe fair fields of Rohan, and even in this Hold among the hills there shall \\nbe no refuge.\\' \\n\\n\\'Dark tidings,\\' said Thjoden, \\'yet not all unguessed. But say to \\nDenethor that even if Rohan itself felt no peril, still we would come to his \\naid. But we have suffered much loss in our battles with Saruman the traitor, \\nand we must still think of our frontier to the north and east, as his own \\ntidings make clear. So great a power as the Dark Lord seems now to wield \\nmight well contain us in battle before the City and yet strike with great \\nforce across the River away beyond the Gate of Kings. \\n\\n\\'But we will speak no longer counsels of prudence. We will come. The \\nweapontake was set for the morrow. When all is ordered we will set out. Ten \\nthousand spears I might have sent riding over the plain to the dismay of \\nyour foes. It will be less now, I fear; for I will not leave my strongholds \\nall unguarded. Yet six thousands at the least shall ride behind me. For say \\nto Denethor that in this hour the King of the Mark himself will come down to \\nthe land of Gondor, though maybe he will not ride back. But it is a long \\nroad, and man and beast must reach the end with strength to fight. A week it \\nmay be from tomorrow\\'s morn ere you hear the cry of the Sons of Eorl coming \\nfrom the North. \\n\\n\\'A week!\\' said Hirgon. \\'If it must be so, it must. But you are like to \\nfind only ruined walls in seven days from now, unless other help \\nunlooked-for comes. Still, you may at the least disturb the Ores and Swarthy \\nMen from their feasting in the White Tower.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'At the least we will do that,\\' said Thjoden. \\'But I myself am new-come \\nfrom battle and long journey, and I will now go to rest. Tarry here this \\nnight. Then you shall look on the muster of Rohan and ride away the gladder \\nfor the sight, and the swifter for the rest. In the morning counsels are \\nbest, and night changes many thoughts. \\n\\nWith that the king stood up, and they all rose. \\'Go now each to your \\nrest.\\' he said, \\'and sleep well. And you, Master Meriadoc, I need no more \\ntonight. But be ready to my call as soon as the Sun is risen.\\' \\n\\n\\'I will be ready,\\' said Merry, \\'even if you bid me ride with you on the \\nPaths of the Dead.\\' \\n\\n\\'Speak not words of omen!\\' said the king. \\'For there may be more roads \\nthan one that could bear that name. But I did not say that I would bid you \\nride with me on any road. Good night!\\' \\n\\n\\'I won\\'t be left behind, to be called for on return!\\' said Merry. \\'I \\nwon\\'t be left, I won\\'t.\\' And repeating this over and over again to himself \\nhe fell asleep at last in his tent. \\n\\nHe was wakened by a man shaking him. \\'Wake up, wake up. Master \\nHolbytla!\\' he cried; and at length Merry came out of deep dreams and sat up \\nwith a start. It still seemed very dark, he thought. \\n\\n\\'What is the matter?\\' he asked. \\n\\n\\'The king calls for you.\\' \\n\\n\\'But the Sun has not risen, yet,\\' said Merry. \\n\\n\\'No, and will not rise today, Master Holbytla. Nor ever again, one \\nwould think under this cloud. But time does not stand still, though the Sun \\nbe lost. Make haste!\\' \\n\\nFlinging on some clothes, Merry looked outside. The world was darkling. \\nThe very air seemed brown, and all things about were black and grey and \\nshadowless; there was a great stillness. No shape of cloud could be seen, \\nunless it were far away westward, where the furthest groping fingers of the \\ngreat gloom still crawled onwards and a little light leaked through them. \\nOverhead there hung a heavy roof, sombre and featureless, and light seemed \\nrather to be failing than growing. \\n\\nMerry saw many folk standing, looking up and muttering: all their faces \\nwere grey and sad, and some were afraid. With a sinking heart he made his \\nway to the king. Hirgon the rider of Gondor was there before him, and beside \\nhim stood now another man, like him and dressed alike, but shorter and \\nbroader. As Merry entered he was speaking to the king. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'It comes from Mordor, lord,\\' he said. \\'It began last night at sunset. \\n\\nFrom the hills in the Eastfold of your realm I saw it rise and creep across \\nthe sky, and all night as I rode it came behind eating up the stars. Now the \\ngreat cloud hangs over all the land between here and the Mountains of \\nShadow; and it is deepening. War has already begun.\\' \\n\\nFor a while the king sat silent. At last he spoke. \\'So we come to it in \\nthe end,\\' he said: \\'the great battle of our time, in which many things shall \\npass away. But at least there is no longer need for hiding. We will ride the \\nstraight way and the open road and with all our speed. The muster shall \\nbegin at once, and wait for none that tarry. Have you good store in Minas \\nTirith? For if we must ride now in all haste, then we must ride light, with \\nbut meal and water enough to last us into battle.\\' \\n\\n\\'We have very great store long prepared,\\' answered Hirgon. Ride now as \\nlight and as swift as you may!\\' \\n\\n\\'Then call the heralds, Jomer,\\' said Thjoden. \\'Let the Riders be \\nmarshalled!\\' \\n\\nJomer went out, and presently the trumpets rang in the Hold and were \\nanswered by many others from below; but their voices no longer sounded clear \\nand brave as they had seemed to Merry the night before. Dull they seemed and \\nharsh in the heavy air, braying ominously. \\n\\nThe king turned to Merry. \\'I am going to war, Master Meriadoc,\\' he \\nsaid. \\'In a little while I shall take the road. I release you from my \\nservice, but not from my friendship. You shall abide here, and if you will, \\nyou shall serve the Lady Jowyn, who will govern the folk in my stead.\\' \\n\\n\\'But, but, lord,\\' Merry stammered, \\'I offered you my sword. I do not \\nwant to be parted from you like this, Thjoden King. And as all my friends \\nhave gone to the battle\\' I should be ashamed to stay behind.\\' \\n\\n\\'But we ride on horses tall and swift,\\' said Thjoden; \\'and great though \\nyour heart be, you cannot ride on such beasts.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then tie me on to the back of one, or let me hang on a stirrup, or \\nsomething,\\' said Merry. \\'It is a long way to run; but run I shall, if I \\ncannot ride, even if I wear my feet off and arrive weeks too late.\\' \\n\\nThjoden smiled. \\'Rather than that I would bear you with me on \\nSnowmane,\\' he said. \\'But at the least you shall ride with me to Edoras and \\nlook on Meduseld; for that way I shall go. So far Stybba can bear you: the \\ngreat race will not begin till we reach the plains.\\' \\n\\nThen Jowyn rose up. \\'Come now, Meriadoc!\\' she said. \\'I will show you \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe gear that I have prepared fur you.\\' They went out together. \\'This \\nrequest only did Aragorn make to me,\\' said Jowyn, as they passed among the \\ntents, \\'that you should be armed for battle. I have granted it, as I could. \\n\\nFor my heart tells me that you will need such gear ere the end.\\' \\n\\nNow she led Merry to a booth among the lodges of the king\\'s guard and \\nthere an armourer brought out to her a small helm, and a round shield, and \\nother gear. \\n\\n\\'No mail have we to fit you,\\' said Jowyn, \\'nor any time for the forging \\nof such a hauberk; but here is also a stout jerkin of leather, a belt, and a \\nknife. A sword you have.\\' \\n\\nMerry bowed, and the lady showed him the shield, which was like the \\nshield that had been given to Gimli, and it bore on it the device of the \\nwhite horse. \\'Take all these things,\\' she said, \\'and bear them to good \\nfortune! Farewell now, Master Meriadoc! Yet maybe we shall meet again, you \\nand I.\\' \\n\\nSo it was that amid a gathering gloom the King of the Mark made ready \\nto lead all his Riders on the eastward road. Flearts were heavy and many \\nquailed in the shadow. But they were a stern people, loyal to their lord, \\nand little weeping or murmuring was heard, even in the camp in the Flold \\nwhere the exiles from Edoras were housed, women and children and old men. \\nDoom hung over them, but they faced it silently. \\n\\nTwo swift hours passed, and now the king sat upon his white horse, \\nglimmering in the half light. Proud and tall he seemed, though the hair that \\nflowed beneath his high helm was like snow; and many marvelled at him and \\ntook heart to see him unbent and unafraid. \\n\\nThere on the wide flats beside the noisy river were marshalled in many \\ncompanies well nigh five and fifty hundreds of Riders fully armed, and many \\nhundreds of other men with spare horses lightly burdened. A single trumpet \\nsounded. The king raised his hand, and then silently the host of the Mark \\nbegan to move. Foremost went twelve of the king\\'s household-men, Riders of \\nrenown. Then the king followed with Jomer on his right. He had said farewell \\nto Jowyn above in the Hold, and the memory was grievous; but now he turned \\nhis mind to the road that lay ahead. Behind him Merry rode on Stybba with \\nthe errand riders of Gondor, and behind them again twelve more of the king\\'s \\nhousehold. They passed down the long ranks of waiting men with stern and \\nunmoved faces. But when they had come almost to the end of the line one \\nlooked up glancing keenly at the hobbit. A young man, Merry thought as he \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nreturned the glance, less in height and girth than most. He caught the glint \\nof clear grey eyes; and then he shivered, for it came suddenly to him that \\nit was the face of one without hope who goes in search of death. \\n\\nOn down the grey road they went beside the Snowbourn rushing on its \\nstones; through the hamlets of Underharrow and Upbourn, where many sad \\nfaces \\n\\nof women looked out from dark doors; and so without horn or harp or music of \\nmen\\'s voices the great ride into the East began with which the songs of \\nRohan were busy for many long lives of men thereafter. \\n\\nFrom dark Dunh arrow in the dim morning \\nwith thane and captain rode Thengel\\'s son: \\nto Edoras he came, the ancient halls \\nof the Mark-wardens mist-enshrouded; \\ngolden timbers were in gloom mantled. \\n\\nFarewell he bade to his free people, \\n\\nhearth and high-seat, and the hallowed places, \\n\\nwhere long he had feasted ere the light faded. \\n\\nForth rode the king, fear behind him, \\nfate before him. Fealty kept he; \\noaths he had taken, all fulfilled them. \\n\\nForth rode Thjoden. Five nights and days \\neast and onward rode the Eorlingas \\nthrough Folde and Fenmarch and the Firienwood, \\nsix thousand spears to Sunlending, \\n\\nMundburg the mighty under Mindolluin, \\n\\nSea-kings\\' city in the South-kingdom \\nfoe-beleaguered, fire-encircled. \\n\\nDoom drove them on. Darkness took them, \\n\\nHorse and horseman; hoofbeats afar \\nsank into silence: so the songs tell us. \\n\\nIt was indeed in deepening gloom that the king came to Edoras, although \\nit was then but noon by the hour. There he halted only a short while and \\nstrengthened his host by some three score of Riders that came late to the \\nweapontake. Now having eaten he made ready to set out again, and he wished \\nhis esquire a kindly farewell. But Merry begged for the last time not to be \\nparted from him. \\n\\nThis is no journey for such steeds as Stybba, as I have told you \\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsaid Thjoden. \\'And in such a battle as we think to make on the fields of \\nGondor what would you do, Master Meriadoc, sword-thain though you be, \\nand \\n\\ngreater of heart than of stature?\\' \\n\\n\\'As for that, who can tell?\\' answered Merry. \\'But why, lord, did you \\nreceive me as sword-thain, if not to stay by your side? And I would not have \\nit said of me in song only that I was always left behind!\\' \\n\\n\\'I received you for your safe-keeping,\\' answered Thjoden; \\'and also to \\ndo as I might bid. None of my Riders can bear you as burden. If the battle \\nwere before my gates, maybe your deeds would be remembered by the \\nminstrels; \\n\\nbut it is a hundred leagues and two to Mundburg where Denethor is lord. I \\nwill say no more.\\' \\n\\nMerry bowed and went away unhappily, and stared at the lines of \\nhorsemen. Already the companies were preparing to start: men were tightening \\ngirths, looking to saddles, caressing their horses; some gazed uneasily at \\nthe lowering sky. Unnoticed a Rider came up and spoke softly in the hobbit\\'s \\near. \\n\\n\\'Where will wants not, a way opens, so we say,\\' he whispered; \\'and so I \\nhave found myself.\\' Merry looked up and saw that it was the young Rider \\nwhom \\n\\nhe had noticed in the morning. \\'You wish to go whither the Lord of the Mark \\ngoes: I see it in your face.\\' \\n\\n\\'I do,\\' said Merry. \\n\\n\\'Then you shall go with me,\\' said the Rider. \\'I will bear you before \\nme, under my cloak until we are far afield, and this darkness is yet darker. \\n\\nSuch good will should not be denied. Say no more to any man, but come!\\' \\n\\n\\'Thank you indeed!\\' said Merry. \\'Thank you, sir, though I do not know \\nyour name.\\' \\n\\n\\'Do you not?\\' said the Rider softly. \\'Then call me Dernhelm.\\' \\n\\nThus it came to pass that when the king set out, before Dernhelm sat \\nMeriadoc the hobbit, and the great grey steed Windfola made little of the \\nburden; for Dernhelm was less in weight than many men, though lithe and \\nwell-knit in frame. \\n\\nOn into the shadow they rode. In the willow-thickets where Snowbourn \\nflowed into Entwash, twelve leagues east of Edoras, they camped that night. \\nAnd then on again through the Folde; and through the Fenmarch, where to \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntheir right great oakwoods climbed on the skirts of the hills under the \\nshades of dark Halifirien by the borders of Gondor; but away to their left \\nthe mists lay on the marshes fed by the mouths of Entwash. And as they rode \\nrumour came of war in the North. Lone men, riding wild, brought word of foes \\nassailing their east -borders, of ore-hosts marching in the Wold of Rohan. \\n\\n\\'Ride on! Ride on!\\' cried Jomer. \\'Too late now to turn aside. The fens \\nof Entwash must guard our flank. Haste now we need. Ride on!\\' \\n\\nAnd so King Thjoden departed from his own realm, and mile by mile the \\nlong road wound away, and the beacon hills marched past: Calenhad, \\nMin-Rimmon, Erelas, Nardol. But their fires were quenched. All the lands \\nwere grey and still; and ever the shadow deepened before them, and hope \\nwaned in every heart. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 4 . The Siege of Gondor \\n\\n\\n\\nPippin was roused by Gandalf. Candles were lit in their chamber, for \\nonly a dim twilight came through the windows; the air was heavy as with \\napproaching thunder. \\n\\n\\'What is the time?\\' said Pippin yawning. \\n\\n\\'Past the second hour,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Time to get up and make yourself \\npresentable. You are summoned to the Lord of the City to learn your new \\nduties.\\' \\n\\n\\'And will he provide breakfast?\\' \\n\\n\\'No! I have provided it: all that you will get till noon. Food is now \\ndoled out by order.\\' \\n\\nPippin looked ruefully at the small loaf and (he thought) very \\ninadequate pat of butter which was set out for him, beside a cup of thin \\nmilk. \\'Why did you bring me here?\\' he said. \\n\\n\\'You know quite well,\\' said Gandalf. \\'To keep you out of mischief; and \\nif you do not like being here, you can remember that you brought it on \\nyourself.\\' Pippin said no more. \\n\\nBefore long he was walking with Gandalf once more down the cold \\ncorridor to the door of the Tower Hall. There Denethor sat in a grey gloom, \\nlike an old patient spider, Pippin thought: he did not seem to have moved \\nsince the day before. He beckoned Gandalf to a seat, but Pippin was left for \\na while standing unheeded. Presently the old man turned to him: \\n\\n\\'Well, Master Peregrin, I hope that you used yesterday to your profit, \\nand to your liking? Though I fear that the board is barer in this city than \\nyou could wish.\\' \\n\\nPippin had an uncomfortable feeling that most of what he had said or \\ndone was somehow known to the Lord of the City, and much was guessed of \\nwhat \\n\\nhe thought as well. He did not answer. \\n\\n\\'What would you do in my service?\\' \\n\\n\\'I thought, sir, that you would tell me my duties.\\' \\n\\n\\'I will, when I learn what you are fit for,\\' said Denethor. \\'But that I \\nshall learn soonest, maybe, if I keep you beside me. The esquire of my \\nchamber has begged leave to go to the out-garrison, so you shall take his \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nplace for a while. You shall wait on me, bear errands, and talk to me, if \\nwar and council leave me any leisure. Can you sing?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Pippin. \\'Well, yes, well enough for my own people. But we \\nhave no songs fit for great halls and evil times, lord. We seldom sing of \\nanything more terrible than wind or rain. And most of my songs are about \\nthings that make us laugh; or about food and drink, of course.\\' \\n\\n\\'And why should such songs be unfit for my halls, or for such hours as \\nthese? We who have lived long under the Shadow may surely listen to echoes \\nfrom a land untroubled by it? Then we may feel that our vigil was not \\nfruitless, though it may have been thankless.\\' \\n\\nPippin\\'s heart sank. He did not relish the idea of singing any song of \\nthe Shire to the Lord of Minas Tirith, certainly not the comic ones that he \\nknew best; they were too, well, rustic for such an occasion. He was however \\nspared the ordeal for the present. He was not commanded to sing. Denethor \\nturned to Gandalf, asking questions about the Rohirrim and their policies, \\nand the position of Jomer, the king\\'s nephew. Pippin marvelled at the amount \\nthat the Lord seemed to know about a people that lived far away, though it \\nmust, he thought, be many years since Denethor himself had ridden abroad. \\n\\nPresently Denethor waved to Pippin and dismissed him again for a while. \\n\\'Go to the armouries of the Citadel,\\' he said, \\'and get you there the livery \\nand gear of the Tower. It will be ready. It was commanded yesterday. Return \\nwhen you are clad!\\' \\n\\nIt was as he said; and Pippin soon found himself arrayed in strange \\ngarments, all of black and silver. He had a small hauberk, its rings forged \\nof steel, maybe, yet black as jet; and a high-crowned helm with small \\nraven-wings on either side, set with a silver star in the centre of the \\ncirclet. Above the mail was a short surcoat of black, but broidered on the \\nbreast in silver with the token of the Tree. His old clothes were folded and \\nput away, but he was permitted to keep the grey cloak of Lurien, though not \\nto wear it when on duty. He looked now, had he known it, verily Ernil i \\nPheriannath, the Prince of the Halflings, that folk had called him; but he \\nfelt uncomfortable. And the gloom began to weigh on his spirits. \\n\\nIt was dark and dim all day. From the sunless dawn until evening the \\nheavy shadow had deepened, and all hearts in the City were oppressed. Far \\nabove a great cloud streamed slowly westward from the Black Land, \\ndevouring \\n\\nlight, borne upon a wind of war; but below the air was still and breathless, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nas if all the Vale of Anduin waited for the onset of a ruinous storm. \\n\\nAbout the eleventh hour, released at last for a while from service. \\n\\nPippin came out and went in search of food and drink to cheer his heavy \\nheart and make his task of waiting more supportable. In the messes he met \\nBeregond again, who had just come from an errand over the Pelennor out to \\nthe Guard-towers upon the Causeway. Together they strolled out to the walls; \\nfor Pippin felt imprisoned indoors, and stifled even in the lofty citadel. \\n\\nNow they sat side by side again in the embrasure looking eastward, where \\nthey had eaten and talked the day before. \\n\\nIt was the sunset-hour, but the great pall had now stretched far into \\nthe West, and only as it sank at last into the Sea did the Sun escape to \\nsend out a brief farewell gleam before the night, even as Frodo saw it at \\nthe Cross-roads touching the head of the fallen king. But to the fields of \\nthe Pelennor, under the shadow of Mindolluin, there came no gleam: they were \\nbrown and drear. \\n\\nAlready it seemed years to Pippin since he had sat there before, in \\nsome half-forgotten time when he had still been a hobbit, a light-hearted \\nwanderer touched little by the perils he had passed through. Now he was one \\nsmall soldier in a city preparing for a great assault, clad in the proud but \\nsombre manner of the Tower of Guard. \\n\\nIn some other time and place Pippin might have been pleased with his \\nnew array, but he knew now that he was taking part in no play; he was in \\ndeadly earnest the servant of a grim master in the greatest peril. The \\nhauberk was burdensome, and the helm weighed upon his head. His cloak he \\nhad \\n\\ncast aside upon the seat. He turned his tired gaze away from the darkling \\nfields below and yawned, and then he sighed. \\n\\n\\'You are weary of this day?\\' said Beregond. \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Pippin, \\'very: tired out with idleness and waiting. I have \\nkicked my heels at the door of my master\\'s chamber for many slow hours, \\nwhile he has debated with Gandalf and the Prince and other great persons. \\nAnd I\\'m not used, Master Beregond, to waiting hungry on others while they \\neat. It is a sore trial for a hobbit, that. No doubt you will think I should \\nfeel the honour more deeply. But what is the good of such honour? Indeed \\nwhat is the good even of food and drink under this creeping shadow? What \\ndoes it mean? The very air seems thick and brown! Do you often have such \\nglooms when the wind is in the East?\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Nay,\\' said Beregond, \\'this is no weather of the world. This is some \\ndevice of his malice; some broil of fume from the Mountain of Fire that he \\nsends to darken hearts and counsel. And so it doth indeed. I wish the Lord \\nFaramir would return. Fie would not be dismayed. But now, who knows if he \\nwill ever come back across the River out of the Darkness?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Pippin, \\'Gandalf, too, is anxious. He was disappointed. I \\nthink, not to find Faramir here. And where has he got to himself? He left \\nthe Lord\\'s council before the noon-meal, and in no good mood either, I \\nthought. Perhaps he has some foreboding of bad news.\\' \\n\\nSuddenly as they talked they were stricken dumb, frozen as it were to \\nlistening stones. Pippin cowered down with his hands pressed to his ears; \\nbut Beregond, who had been looking out from the battlement as he spoke of \\nFaramir, remained there, stiffened, staring out with starting eyes. Pippin \\nknew the shuddering cry that he had heard: it was the same that he had heard \\nlong ago in the Marish of the Shire, but now it was grown in power and \\nhatred, piercing the heart with a poisonous despair. \\n\\nAt last Beregond spoke with an effort. \\'They have come!\\' he said. \\'Take \\ncourage and look! There are fell things below.\\' \\n\\nReluctantly Pippin climbed on to the seat and looked out over the wall. \\n\\nThe Pelennor lay dim beneath him, fading away to the scarce guessed line of \\nthe Great River. But now wheeling swiftly across it, like shadows of \\nuntimely night, he saw in the middle airs below him five birdlike forms, \\nhorrible as carrion-fowl yet greater than eagles, cruel as death. Now they \\nswooped near, venturing almost within bowshot of the walls, now they circled \\naway. \\n\\n\\'Black Riders!\\' muttered Pippin. \\'Black Riders of the air! But see, \\nBeregond!\\' he cried. \\'They are looking for something, surely? See how they \\nwheel and swoop, always down to that point over there! And can you see \\nsomething moving on the ground? Dark little things. Yes, men on horses: four \\nor five. Ah! I cannot stand it! Gandalf! Gandalf save us!\\' \\n\\nAnother long screech rose and fell, and he threw himself back again \\nfrom the wall, panting like a hunted animal. Faint and seemingly remote \\nthrough that shuddering cry he heard winding up from below the sound of a \\ntrumpet ending on a long high note. \\n\\n\\'Faramir! The Lord Faramir! It is his call!\\' cried Beregond. \\'Brave \\nheart! But how can he win to the Gate, if these foul hell -hawks have other \\nweapons than fear? But look! They hold on. They will make the Gate. No! the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhorses are running mad. Look! the men are thrown; they are running on foot. \\nNo, one is still up, but he rides back to the others. That will be the \\nCaptain: he can master both beasts and men. Ah! there one of the foul things \\nis stooping on him. Help! help! Will no one go out to him? Faramir!\\' \\n\\nWith that Beregond sprang away and ran off into the gloom. Ashamed of \\nhis terror, while Beregond of the Guard thought first of the captain whom he \\nloved, Pippin got up and peered out. At that moment he caught a flash of \\nwhite and silver coming from the North, like a small star down on the dusky \\nfields. It moved with the speed of an arrow and grew as it came, converging \\nswiftly with the flight of the four men towards the Gate. It seemed to \\nPippin that a pale light was spread about it and the heavy shadows gave way \\nbefore it; and then as it drew near he thought that he heard, like an echo \\nin the walls, a great voice calling. \\n\\n\\'Gandalf!\\' he cried. \\'Gandalf! He always turns up when things are \\ndarkest. Go on! Go on, White Rider! Gandalf, Gandalf!\\' he shouted wildly, \\nlike an onlooker at a great race urging on a runner who is far beyond \\nencouragement. \\n\\nBut now the dark swooping shadows were aware of the newcomer. One \\nwheeled towards him; but it seemed to Pippin that he raised his hand, and \\nfrom it a shaft of white light stabbed upwards. The Nazgyl gave a long \\nwailing cry and swerved away; and with that the four others wavered, and \\nthen rising in swift spirals they passed away eastward vanishing into the \\nlowering cloud above; and down on the Pelennor it seemed for a while less \\ndark. \\n\\nPippin watched, and he saw the horseman and the White Rider meet and \\nhalt, waiting for those on foot. Men now hurried out to them from the City; \\nand soon they all passed from sight under the outer walls, and he knew that \\nthey were entering the Gate. Guessing that they would come at once to the \\nTower and the Steward, he hurried to the entrance of the citadel. There he \\nwas joined by many others who had watched the race and the rescue from the \\nhigh walls. \\n\\nIt was not long before a clamour was heard in the streets leading up \\nfrom the outer circles, and there was much cheering and crying of the names \\nof Faramir and Mithrandir. Presently Pippin saw torches, and followed by a \\npress of people two horsemen riding slowly: one was in white but shining no \\nlonger, pale in the twilight as if his fire was spent or veiled; the other \\nwas dark and his head was bowed. They dismounted, and as grooms took \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShadowfax and the other horse, they walked forward to the sentinel at the \\ngate: Gandalf steadily, his grey cloak flung back, and a fire still \\nsmouldering in his eyes; the other, clad all in green, slowly, swaying a \\nlittle as a weary or a wounded man. \\n\\nPippin pressed forward as they passed under the lamp beneath the \\ngate-arch, and when he saw the pale face of Faramir he caught his breath. It \\nwas the face of one who has been assailed by a great fear or anguish, but \\nhas mastered it and now is quiet. Proud and grave he stood for a moment as \\nhe spoke to the guard, and Pippin gazing at him saw how closely he resembled \\nhis brother Boromir - whom Pippin had liked from the first, admiring the \\ngreat man\\'s lordly but kindly manner. Yet suddenly for Faramir his heart was \\nstrangely moved with a feeling that he had not known before. Flere was one \\nwith an air of high nobility such as Aragorn at times revealed, less high \\nperhaps, yet also less incalculable and remote: one of the Kings of Men born \\ninto a later time, but touched with the wisdom and sadness of the Elder \\nRace. He knew now why Beregond spoke his name with love. He was a \\ncaptain \\n\\nthat men would follow, that he would follow, even under the shadow of the \\nblack wings. \\n\\n\\'Faramir!\\' he cried aloud with the others. \\'Faramir!\\' And Faramir \\ncatching his strange voice among the clamour of the men of the City, turned \\nand looked down at him and was amazed. \\n\\n\\'Whence come you?\\' he said. \\'A halfling, and in the livery of the \\nTower! Whence...?\\' \\n\\nBut with that Gandalf stepped to his side and spoke. \\'He came with me \\nfrom the land of the Halflings,\\' he said. \\'He came with me. But let us not \\ntarry here. There is much to say and to do, and you are weary. He shall come \\nwith us. Indeed he must, for if he does not forget his new duties more \\neasily than I do, he must attend on his lord again within this hour. Come, \\nPippin, follow us!\\' \\n\\nSo at length they came to the private chamber of the Lord of the City. \\nThere deep seats were set about a brazier of charcoal; and wine was brought; \\nand there Pippin, hardly noticed, stood behind the chair of Denethor and \\nfelt his weariness little, so eagerly did he listen to all that was said. \\n\\nWhen Faramir had taken white bread and drunk a draught of wine, he sat \\nupon a low chair at his father\\'s left hand. Removed a little upon the other \\nside sat Gandalf in a chair of carven wood; and he seemed at first to be \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nasleep. For at the beginning Faramir spoke only of the errand upon which he \\nhad been sent out ten days before, and he brought tidings of Ithilien and of \\nmovements of the Enemy and his allies; and he told of the fight on the road \\nwhen the men of Harad and their great beast were overthrown: a captain \\nreporting to his master such matters as had often been heard before, small \\nthings of border-war that now seemed useless and petty, shorn of their \\nrenown. \\n\\nThen suddenly Faramir looked at Pippin. \\'But now we come to strange \\nmatters,\\' he said. \\'For this is not the first halfling that I have seen \\nwalking out of northern legends into the Southlands.\\' \\n\\nAt that Gandalf sat up and gripped the arms of his chair; but he said \\nnothing, and with a look stopped the exclamation on Pippin\\'s lips. Denethor \\nlooked at their faces and nodded his head, as though in sign that he had \\nread much there before it was spoken. Slowly, while the others sat silent \\nand still, Faramir told his tale, with his eyes for the most part on \\nGandalf, though now and again his glance strayed to Pippin, as if to refresh \\nhis memory of others that he had seen. \\n\\nAs his story was unfolded of his meeting with Frodo and his servant and \\nof the events at Henneth Annyn, Pippin became aware that Gandalf s hands \\nwere trembling as they clutched the carven wood. White they seemed now \\nand \\n\\nvery old, and as he looked at them, suddenly with a thrill of fear Pippin \\nknew that Gandalf, Gandalf himself, was troubled, even afraid. The air of \\nthe room was close and still. At last when Faramir spoke of his parting with \\nthe travellers, and of their resolve to go to Cirith Ungol, his voice fell, \\nand he shook his head and sighed. Then Gandalf sprang up. \\n\\n\\'Cirith Ungol? Morgul Vale?\\' he said. \\'The time, Faramir, the time? \\nWhen did you part with them? When would they reach that accursed valley?\\' \\n\\n\\'I parted with them in the morning two days ago,\\' said Faramir. \\'It is \\nfifteen leagues thence to the vale of the Morgulduin, if they went straight \\nsouth; and then they would be still five leagues westward of the accursed \\nTower. At swiftest they could not come there before today, and maybe they \\nhave not come there yet. Indeed I see what you fear. But the darkness is not \\ndue to their venture. It began yestereve, and all Ithilien was under shadow \\nlast night. It is clear to me that the Enemy has long planned an assault on \\nus, and its hour had already been determined before ever the travellers left \\nmy keeping.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGandalf paced the floor. The morning of two days ago, nigh on three \\ndays of journey! How far is the place where you parted?\\' \\n\\n\\'Some twenty-five leagues as a bird flies,\\' answered Faramir. \\'But I \\ncould not come more swiftly. Yestereve I lay at Cair Andros, the long isle \\nin the River northward which we hold in defence; and horses are kept on the \\nhither bank. As the dark drew on I knew that haste was needed, so I rode \\nthence with three others that could also be horsed. The rest of my company I \\nsent south to strengthen the garrison at the fords of Osgiliath. I hope that \\nI have not done ill?\\' He looked at his father. \\n\\n\\'111?\\' cried Denethor, and his eyes flashed suddenly. \\'Why do you ask? \\n\\nThe men were under your command. Or do you ask for my judgement on all \\nyour \\n\\ndeeds? Your bearing is lowly in my presence, yet it is long now since you \\nturned from your own way at my counsel. See, you have spoken skilfully, as \\never; but I, have I not seen your eye fixed on Mithrandir, seeking whether \\nyou said well or too much? He has long had your heart in his keeping. \\n\\n\\'My son, your father is old but not yet dotard. I can see and hear, as \\nwas my wont; and little of what you have half said or left unsaid is now \\nhidden from me. I know the answer to many riddles. Alas, alas for Boromir!\\' \\n\\n\\'If what I have done displeases you, my father,\\' said Faramir quietly, \\n\\n\\'I wish I had known your counsel before the burden of so weighty a judgement \\nwas thrust on me.\\' \\n\\n\\'Would that have availed to change your judgement?\\' said Denethor. \\'You \\nwould still have done just so, I deem. I know you well. Ever your desire is \\nto appear lordly and generous as a king of old, gracious, gentle. That may \\nwell befit one of high race, if he sits in power and peace. But in desperate \\nhours gentleness may be repaid with death.\\' \\n\\n\\'So be it,\\' said Faramir. \\n\\n\\'So be it!\\' cried Denethor. \\'But not with your death only, Lord \\nFaramir: with the death also of your father, and of all your people, whom it \\nis your part to protect now that Boromir is gone.\\' \\n\\n\\'Do you wish then,\\' said Faramir, \\'that our places had been exchanged?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, I wish that indeed,\\' said Denethor. \\'For Boromir was loyal to me \\nand no wizard\\'s pupil. He would have remembered his father\\'s need, and would \\nnot have squandered what fortune gave. He would have brought me a mighty \\ngift.\\' \\n\\nFor a moment Faramir\\'s restraint gave way. \\'I would ask you, my father, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nto remember why it was that I, not he, was in Ithilien. On one occasion at \\nleast your counsel has prevailed, not long ago. It was the Lord of the City \\nthat gave the errand to him.\\' \\n\\n\\'Stir not the bitterness in the cup that I mixed for myself,\\' said \\nDenethor. \\'Have I not tasted it now many nights upon my tongue foreboding \\nthat worse yet lay in the dregs? As now indeed I find. Would it were not so! \\nWould that this thing had come to me!\\' \\n\\n\\'Comfort yourself!\\' said Gandalf. \\'In no case would Boromir have \\nbrought it to you. He is dead, and died well; may he sleep in peace! Yet you \\ndeceive yourself. He would have stretched out his hand to this thing, and \\ntaking it he would have fallen. He would have kept it for his own, and when \\nhe returned you would not have known your son.\\' \\n\\nThe face of Denethor set hard and cold. \\'You found Boromir less apt to \\nyour hand, did you not?\\' he said softly. \\'But I who was his father say that \\nhe would have brought it to me. You are wise, maybe, Mithrandir, yet with \\nall your subtleties you have not all wisdom. Counsels may be found that are \\nneither the webs of wizards nor the haste of fools. I have in this matter \\nmore lore and wisdom than you deem. \\' \\n\\n\\'What then is your wisdom?\\' said Gandalf. \\n\\n\\'Enough to perceive that there are two follies to avoid. To use this \\nthing is perilous. At this hour, to send it in the hands of a witless \\nhalfling into the land of the Enemy himself, as you have done, and this son \\nof mine, that is madness.\\' \\n\\n\\'And the Lord Denethor what would he have done?\\' \\n\\n\\'Neither. But most surely not for any argument would he have set this \\nthing at a hazard beyond all but a fool\\'s hope, risking our utter ruin, if \\nthe Enemy should recover what he lost. Nay, it should have been kept, \\nhidden, hidden dark and deep. Not used, I say, unless at the uttermost end \\nof need, but set beyond his grasp, save by a victory so final that what then \\nbefell would not trouble us, being dead.\\' \\n\\n\\'You think, as is your wont, my lord, of Gondor only,\\' said Gandalf. \\n\\n\\'Yet there are other men and other lives, and time still to be. And for me, \\n\\nI pity even his slaves.\\' \\n\\n\\'And where will other men look for help, if Gondor falls?\\' answered \\nDenethor. \\'If I had this thing now in the deep vaults of this citadel, we \\nshould not then shake with dread under this gloom, fearing the worst, and \\nour counsels would be undisturbed. If you do not trust me to endure the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntest, you do not know me yet.\\' \\n\\n\\'Nonetheless I do not trust you,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Had I done so, I could \\nhave sent this thing hither to your keeping and spared myself and others \\nmuch anguish. And now hearing you speak I trust you less, no more than \\nBoromir. Nay, stay your wrath! I do not trust myself in this, and I refused \\nthis thing, even as a freely given gift. You are strong and can still in \\nsome matters govern yourself, Denethor; yet if you had received this thing, \\nit would have overthrown you. Were it buried beneath the roots of \\nMindolluin, still it would burn your mind away, as the darkness grows, and \\nthe yet worse things follow that soon shall come upon us.\\' \\n\\nFor a moment the eyes of Denethor glowed again as he faced Gandalf, and \\nPippin felt once more the strain between their wills; but now almost it \\nseemed as if their glances were like blades from eye to eye, flickering as \\nthey fenced. Pippin trembled fearing some dreadful stroke. But suddenly \\nDenethor relaxed and grew cold again. He shrugged his shoulders. \\n\\n\\'If I had! If you had!\\' he said. \\'Such words and ifs are vain. It has \\ngone into the Shadow, and only time will show what doom awaits it and us. \\nThe time will not be long. In what is left, let all who fight the Enemy in \\ntheir fashion be at one, and keep hope while they may, and after hope still \\nthe hardihood to die free.\\' He turned to Faramir. \\'What think you of the \\ngarrison at Osgiliath?\\' \\n\\n\\'It is not strong,\\' said Faramir. \\'I have sent the company of Ithilien \\nto strengthen it, as I have said.\\' \\n\\n\\'Not enough, I deem,\\' said Denethor. \\'It is there that the first blow \\nwill fall. They will have need of some stout captain there.\\' \\n\\n\\'There and elsewhere in many places,\\' said Faramir, and sighed. \\'Alas \\nfor my brother, whom I too loved!\\' He rose. \\'May I have your leave, father?\\' \\nAnd then he swayed and leaned upon his father\\'s chair. \\n\\n\\'You are weary, I see,\\' said Denethor. \\'You have ridden fast and far, \\nand under shadows of evil in the air, I am told.\\' \\n\\n\\'Let us not speak of that!\\' said Faramir. \\n\\n\\'Then we will not,\\' said Denethor. \\'Go now and rest as you may. \\nTomorrow\\'s need will be sterner.\\' \\n\\nAll now took leave of the Lord of the City and went to rest while they \\nstill could. Outside there was a starless blackness as Gandalf with Pippin \\nbeside him bearing a small torch, made his way to their lodging. They did \\nnot speak until they were behind closed doors. Then at last Pippin took \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGandalf s hand. \\n\\nTell me,\\' he said, \\'is there any hope? For Frodo, I mean; or at least \\nmostly for Frodo.\\' \\n\\nGandalf put his hand on Pippin\\'s head. \\'There never was much hope,\\' he \\nanswered. \\'Just a fool\\'s hope, as I have been told. And when I heard of \\n\\nCirith Ungol \\' He broke off and strode to the window as if his eyes \\n\\ncould pierce the night in the East. \\'Cirith Ungol!\\' he muttered. \\'Why that \\nway, I wonder?\\' He turned. \\'Just now, Pippin, my heart almost failed me, \\nhearing that name. And yet in truth I believe that the news that Faramir \\nbrings has some hope in it. For it seems clear that our Enemy has opened his \\nwar at last and made the first move while Frodo was still free. So now for \\nmany days he will have his eye turned this way and that, away from his own \\nland. And yet, Pippin, I feel from afar his haste and fear. He has begun \\nsooner than he would. Something has happened to stir him.\\' \\n\\nGandalf stood for a moment in thought. \\'Maybe,\\' he muttered. \\'Maybe \\neven your foolishness helped, my lad. Let me see: some five days ago now he \\nwould discover that we had thrown down Saruman and had taken the Stone. \\nStill what of that? We could not use it to much purpose, or without his \\nknowing. Ah! I wonder. Aragorn? His time draws near. And he is strong and \\nstern underneath, Pippin; bold, determined, able to take his own counsel and \\ndare great risks at need. That may be it. He may have used the Stone and \\nshown himself to the Enemy, challenging him, for this very purpose. I \\nwonder. Well, we shall not know the answer till the Riders of Rohan come, if \\nthey do not come too late. There are evil days ahead. To sleep while we \\nmay!\\' \\n\\n\\'But,\\' said Pippin. \\n\\n\\'But what?\\' said Gandalf. \\'Only one but will I allow tonight.\\' \\n\\n\\'Gollum,\\' said Pippin. \\'How on earth could they be going about with \\nhim, even following him? And I could see that Faramir did not like the place \\nhe was taking them to any more than you do. What is wrong?\\' \\n\\n\\'I cannot answer that now,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Yet my heart guessed that \\nFrodo and Gollum would meet before the end. For good, or for evil. But of \\nCirith Ungol I will not speak tonight. Treachery, treachery I fear; \\ntreachery of that miserable creature. But so it must be. Let us remember \\nthat a traitor may betray himself and do good that he does not intend. It \\ncan be so, sometimes. Good night! \\' \\n\\nThe next day came with a morning like a brown dusk, and the hearts of \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmen, lifted for a while by the return of Faramir, sank low again. The winged \\nShadows were not seen again that day, yet ever and anon, high above the \\ncity, a faint cry would come, and many who heard it would stand stricken \\nwith a passing dread, while the less stout-hearted quailed and wept. \\n\\nAnd now Faramir was gone again. \\'They give him no rest,\\' some murmured. \\n\\'The Lord drives his son too hard, and now he must do the duty of two, for \\nhimself and for the one that will not return.\\' And ever men looked \\nnorthward, asking: \\'Where are the Riders of Rohan?\\' \\n\\nIn truth Faramir did not go by his own choosing. But the Lord of the \\nCity was master of his Council, and he was in no mood that day to bow to \\nothers. Early in the morning the Council had been summoned. There all the \\ncaptains judged that because of the threat in the South their force was too \\nweak to make any stroke of war on their own part, unless perchance the \\nRiders of Rohan yet should come. Meanwhile they must man the walls and \\nwait. \\n\\n\\'Yet,\\' said Denethor, \\'we should not lightly abandon the outer \\ndefences, the Rammas made with so great a labour. And the Enemy must \\npay \\n\\ndearly for the crossing of the River. That he cannot do, in force to assail \\nthe City, either north of Cair Andros because of the marshes, or southwards \\ntowards Lebennin because of the breadth of the River, that needs many boats. \\n\\nIt is at Osgiliath that he will put his weight, as before when Boromir \\ndenied him the passage.\\' \\n\\n\\'That was but a trial,\\' said Faramir. \\'Today we may make the Enemy pay \\nten times our loss at the passage and yet rue the exchange. For he can \\nafford to lose a host better than we to lose a company. And the retreat of \\nthose that we put out far afield will be perilous, if he wins across in \\nforce.\\' \\n\\n\\'And what of Cair Andros?\\' said the Prince. \\'That, too, must be held, \\nif Osgiliath is defended. Let us not forget the danger on our left. The \\nRohirrim may come, and they may not. But Faramir has told us of great \\nstrength drawing ever to the Black Gate. More than one host may issue from \\nit, and strike for more than one passage.\\' \\n\\n\\'Much must be risked in war,\\' said Denethor. \\'Cair Andros is manned and \\nno more can be sent so far. But I will not yield the River and the Pelennor \\nunfought - not if there is a captain here who has still the courage to do \\nhis lord\\'s will.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThen all were silent, but at length Faramir said: \\'I do not oppose your \\nwill, sire. Since you are robbed of Boromir, I will go and do what I can in \\nhis stead - if you command it.\\' \\n\\n\\'I do so,\\' said Denethor. \\n\\nThen farewell!\\' said Faramir. \\'But if I should return, think better of \\nme!\\' \\n\\n\\'That depends on the manner of your return,\\' said Denethor. \\n\\nGandalf it was that last spoke to Faramir ere he rode east. \\'Do not \\nthrow your live away rashly or in bitterness,\\' he said. \\'You will be needed \\nhere, for other things than war. Your father loves you, Faramir, and will \\nremember it ere the end. Farewell!\\' \\n\\nSo now the Lord Faramir had gone forth again, and had taken with him \\nsuch strength of men as were willing to go or could be spared. On the walls \\nsome gazed through the gloom towards the ruined city, and they wondered \\nwhat \\n\\nchanced there, for nothing could be seen. And others, as ever, looked north \\nand counted the leagues to Thjoden in Rohan. \\'Will he come? Will he \\nremember \\n\\nour old alliance?\\' they said. \\n\\n\\'Yes, he will come,\\' said Gandalf, \\'even if he comes too late. But \\nthink! At best the Red Arrow cannot have reached him more than two days \\nago, \\n\\nand the miles are long from Edoras.\\' \\n\\nIt was night again ere news came. A man rode in haste from the fords, \\nsaying that a host had issued from Minas Morgul and was already drawing nigh \\nto Osgiliath; and it had been joined by regiments from the South, Haradrim, \\ncruel and tall. \\'And we have learned \\' said the messenger, \\'that the Black \\nCaptain leads them once again, and the fear of him has passed before him \\nover the River.\\' \\n\\nWith those ill-boding words the third day closed since Pippin came to \\nMinas Tirith. Few went to rest, for small hope had any now that even Faramir \\ncould hold the fords for long. \\n\\nThe next day, though the darkness had reached its full and grew no \\ndeeper, it weighed heavier on men\\'s hearts, and a great dread was on them. \\n\\nIll news came soon again. The passage of Anduin was won by the Enemy. \\nFaramir was retreating to the wall of the Pelennor, rallying his men to the \\nCauseway Forts; but he was ten times outnumbered. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'If he wins back at all across the Pelennor, his enemies will be on his \\nheels,\\' said the messenger. \\'They have paid dear for the crossing but less \\ndearly than we hoped. The plan has been well laid. It is now seen that in \\nsecret they have long been building floats and barges in great numbers in \\nEast Osgiliath. They swarmed across like beetles. But it is the Black \\nCaptain that defeats us. Few will stand and abide even the rumour of his \\ncoming. His own folk quail at him, and they would slay themselves at his \\nbidding.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then I am needed there more than here,\\' said Gandalf, and rode off at \\nonce, and the glimmer of him faded soon from sight. And all that night \\nPippin alone and sleepless stood upon the wall and gazed eastward. \\n\\nThe bells of day had scarcely rung out again, a mockery in the \\nunlightened dark, when far away he saw fires spring up, across in the dim \\nspaces where the walls of the Pelennor stood. The watchmen cried aloud, and \\nall men in the City stood to arms. Now ever and anon there was a red flash, \\nand slowly through the heavy air dull rumbles could be heard. \\n\\n\\'They have taken the wall!\\' men cried. \\'They are blasting breaches in \\nit. They are coming!\\' \\n\\n\\'Where is Faramir?\\' cried Beregond in dismay. \\'Say not that he has \\nfallen!\\' \\n\\nIt was Gandalf that brought the first tidings. With a handful of \\nhorsemen he came in the middle morning, riding as escort to a line of wains. \\nThey were filled with wounded men, all that could be saved from the wreck of \\nthe Causeway Forts. At once he went to Denethor. The Ford of the City sat \\nnow in a high chamber above the Hall of the White Tower with Pippin at his \\nside; and through the dim windows, north and south and east, he bent his \\ndark eyes, as if to pierce the shadows of doom that ringed him round. Most \\nto the north he looked, and would pause at whiles to listen as if by some \\nancient art his ears might hear the thunder of hoofs on the plains far away. \\n\\n\\'Is Faramir come?\\' he asked. \\n\\n\\'No,\\' said Gandalf. \\'But he still lived when I left him. Yet he is \\nresolved to stay with the rearguard, lest the retreat over the Pelennor \\nbecome a rout. He may, perhaps, hold his men together long enough, but I \\ndoubt it. He is pitted against a foe too great. For one has come that I \\nfeared.\\' \\n\\n\\'Not - the Dark Ford?\\' cried Pippin, forgetting his place in his \\nterror. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDenethor laughed bitterly. \\'Nay, not yet, Master Peregrin! He will not \\ncome save only to triumph over me when all is won. He uses others as his \\nweapons. So do all great lords, if they are wise, Master Halfling. Or why \\nshould I sit here in my tower and think, and watch, and wait, spending even \\nmy sons? For I can still wield a brand.\\' \\n\\nHe stood up and cast open his long black cloak, and behold! he was clad \\nin mail beneath, and girt with a long sword, great-hilted in a sheath of \\nblack and silver. \\'Thus have I walked, and thus now for many years have I \\nslept,\\' he said, \\'lest with age the body should grow soft and timid.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yet now under the Lord of Barad-dyr the most fell of all his captains \\nis already master of your outer walls,\\' said Gandalf. \\'King of Angmar long \\nago, Sorcerer, Ringwraith, Lord of the Nazgyl, a spear of terror in the hand \\nof Sauron, shadow of despair.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then, Mithrandir, you had a foe to match you,\\' said Denethor. \\'For \\nmyself, I have long known who is the chief captain of the hosts of the Dark \\nTower. Is this all that you have returned to say? Or can it be that you have \\nwithdrawn because you are overmatched?\\' \\n\\nPippin trembled, fearing that Gandalf would be stung to sudden wrath, \\nbut his fear was needless. \\'It might be so,\\' Gandalf answered softly. \\'But \\nour trial of strength is not yet come. And if words spoken of old be true, \\nnot by the hand of man shall he fall, and hidden from the Wise is the doom \\nthat awaits him. However that may be, the Captain of Despair does not press \\nforward, yet. He rules rather according to the wisdom that you have just \\nspoken, from the rear, driving his slaves in madness on before. \\n\\n\\'Nay, I came rather to guard the hurt men that can yet be healed; for \\nthe Rammas is breached far and wide, and soon the host of Morgul will enter \\nin at many points. And I came chiefly to say this. Soon there will be battle \\non the fields. A sortie must be made ready. Let it be of mounted men. In \\nthem lies our brief hope, for in one thing only is the enemy still poorly \\nprovided: he has few horsemen.\\' \\n\\n\\'And we also have few. Now would the coming of Rohan be in the nick of \\ntime,\\' said Denethor. \\n\\n\\'We are likely to see other newcomers first,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Fugitives \\nfrom Cair Andros have already reached us. The isle has fallen. Another army \\nis come from the Black Gate, crossing from the north-east.\\' \\n\\n\\'Some have accused you, Mithrandir, of delighting to bear ill news,\\' \\nsaid Denethor, \\'but to me this is no longer news: it was known to mw ere \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnightfall yesterday. As for the sortie, I had already given thought to it. \\n\\nLet us go down.\\' \\n\\nTime passed. At length watchers on the walls could see the retreat of \\nthe out-companies. Small bands of weary and often wounded men came first \\nwith little order; some were running wildly as if pursued. Away to the \\neastward the distant fires flickered; and now it seemed that here and there \\nthey crept across the plain. Houses and barns were burning. Then from many \\npoints little rivers of red flame came hurrying on, winding through the \\ngloom, converging towards the line of the broad road that led from the \\nCity-gate to Osgiliath. \\n\\n\\'The enemy,\\' men murmured. \\'The dike is down. Here they come pouring \\nthrough the breaches! And they carry torches, it seems. Where are our own \\nfolk?\\' \\n\\nIt drew now to evening by the hour, and the light was so dim that even \\nfar-sighted men upon the Citadel could discern little clearly out upon the \\nfields, save only the burnings that ever multiplied, and the lines of fire \\nthat grew in length and speed. At last, less than a mile from the City, a \\nmore ordered mass of men came into view, marching not running, still holding \\ntogether. \\n\\nThe watchers held their breath. \\'Faramir must be there,\\' they said. \\'He \\ncan govern man and beast. He will make it yet.\\' \\n\\nNow the main retreat was scarcely two furlongs distant. Out of the \\ngloom behind a small company of horsemen galloped, all that was left of the \\nrearguard. Once again they turned at bay, facing the oncoming lines of fire. \\nThen suddenly there was a tumult of fierce cries. Horsemen of the enemy \\nswept up. The lines of fire became flowing torrents, file upon file of Ores \\nbearing flames, and wild Southron men with red banners, shouting with harsh \\ntongues, surging up, overtaking the retreat. And with a piercing cry out of \\nthe dim sky fell the winged shadows, the Nazgyl stooping to the kill. \\n\\nThe retreat became a rout. Already men were breaking away, flying wild \\nand witless here and there, flinging away their weapons, crying out in fear, \\nfalling to the ground. \\n\\nAnd then a trumpet rang from the Citadel, and Denethor at last released \\nthe sortie. Drawn up within the shadow of the Gate and under the looming \\nwalls outside they had waited for his signal: all the mounted men that were \\nleft in the City. Now they sprang forward, formed, quickened to a gallop, \\nand charged with a great shout. And from the walls an answering shout went \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nup; for foremost on the field rode the swan-knights of Dol Amroth with their \\nPrince and his blue banner at their head. \\n\\n\\'Amroth for Gondor!\\' they cried. \\'Amroth to Faramir!\\' \\n\\nLike thunder they broke upon the enemy on either flank of the retreat; \\nbut one rider outran them all, swift as the wind in the grass: Shadowfax \\nbore him, shining, unveiled once more, a light starting from his upraised \\nhand. \\n\\nThe Nazgyl screeched and swept away, for their Captain was not yet come \\nto challenge the white fire of his foe. The hosts of Morgul intent on their \\nprey, taken at unawares in wild career, broke, scattering like sparks in a \\ngale. The out-companies with a great cheer turned and smote their pursuers. \\nHunters became the hunted. The retreat became an onslaught. The field was \\nstrewn with stricken ores and men, and a reek arose of torches cast away, \\nsputtering out in swirling smoke. The cavalry rode on. \\n\\nBut Denethor did not permit them to go far. Though the enemy was \\nchecked, and for the moment driven back, great forces were flowing in from \\nthe East. Again the trumpet rang, sounding the retreat. The cavalry of \\nGondor halted. Behind their screen the out-companies re-formed. Now steadily \\nthey came marching back. They reached the Gate of the City and entered, \\nstepping proudly: and proudly the people of the City looked on them and \\ncried their praise, and yet they were troubled in heart. For the companies \\nwere grievously reduced. Faramir had lost a third of his men. And where was \\nhe? \\n\\nLast of all he came. His men passed in. The mounted knights returned, \\nand at their rear the banner of Dol Amroth, and the Prince. And in his arms \\nbefore him on his horse he bore the body of his kinsman, Faramir son of \\nDenethor, found upon the stricken field. \\n\\n\\'Faramir! Faramir!\\' men cried, weeping in the streets. But he did not \\nanswer, and they bore him away up the winding road to the Citadel and his \\nfather. Even as the Nazgyl had swerved aside from the onset of the White \\nRider, there came flying a deadly dart, and Faramir, as he held at bay a \\nmounted champion of Harad, had fallen to the earth. Only the charge of Dol \\nAmroth had saved him from the red southland swords that would have hewed \\nhim \\n\\nas he lay. \\n\\nThe Prince Imrahil brought Faramir to the White Tower, and he said: \\nYour son has returned, lord, after great deeds, and he told all that he had \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nseen. But Denethor rose and looked on the face of his son and was silent. \\n\\nThen he bade them make a bed in the chamber and lay Faramir upon it and \\ndepart. But he himself went up alone into the secret room under the summit \\nof the Tower; and many who looked up thither at that time saw a pale light \\nthat gleamed and flickered from the narrow windows for a while, and then \\nflashed and went out. And when Denethor descended again he went to \\nFaramir \\n\\nand sat beside him without speaking, but the face of the Lord was grey, more \\ndeathlike than his son\\'s. \\n\\nSo now at last the City was besieged, enclosed in a ring of foes. The \\nRammas was broken, and all the Pelennor abandoned to the Enemy. The last \\nword to come from outside the walls was brought by men flying down the \\nnorthward road ere the Gate was shut. They were the remnant of the guard \\nthat was kept at that point where the way from Anurien and Rohan ran into \\nthe townlands: Ingold led them, the same who had admitted Gandalf and Pippin \\nless than five days before, while the sun still rose and there was hope in \\nthe morning. \\n\\nThere is no news of the Rohirrim,\\' he said. \\'Rohan will not come now. \\n\\nOr if they come, it will not avail us. The new host that we had tidings of \\nhas come first, from over the River by way of Andros, it is said. They are \\nstrong: battalions of Ores of the Eye, and countless companies of Men of a \\nnew sort that we have not met before. Not tall, but broad and grim, bearded \\nlike dwarves, wielding great axes. Out of some savage land in the wide East \\nthey come, we deem. They hold the northward road; and many have passed \\non \\n\\ninto Anurien. The Rohirrim cannot come.\\' \\n\\nThe Gate was shut. All night watchmen on the walls heard the rumour of \\nthe enemy that roamed outside, burning field and tree, and hewing any man \\nthat they found abroad, living or dead. The numbers that had already passed \\nover the River could not be guessed in the darkness, but when morning, or \\nits dim shadow, stole over the plain, it was seen that even fear by night \\nhad scarcely over-counted them. The plain was dark with their marching \\ncompanies, and as far as eyes could strain in the mirk there sprouted, like \\na foul fungus-growth, all about the beleaguered city great camps of tents, \\nblack or sombre red. \\n\\nBusy as ants hurrying ores were digging, digging lines of deep trenches \\nin a huge ring, just out of bowshot from the walls; and as the trenches were \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmade each was filled with fire, though how it was kindled or fed, by art or \\ndevilry, none could see. All day the labour went forward, while the men of \\nMinas Tirith looked on, unable to hinder it. And as each length of trench \\nwas completed, they could see great wains approaching; and soon yet more \\ncompanies of the enemy were swiftly setting up, each behind the cover of a \\ntrench, great engines for the casting of missiles. There were none upon the \\nCity walls large enough to reach so far or to stay the work. \\n\\nAt first men laughed and did not greatly fear such devices. For the \\nmain wall of the City was of great height and marvellous thickness, built \\nere the power and craft of N(r)menor waned in exile; and its outward face was \\nlike to the Tower of Orthanc, hard and dark and smooth, unconquerable by \\nsteel or fire, unbreakable except by some convulsion that would rend the \\nvery earth on which it stood. \\n\\n\\'Nay,\\' they said, \\'not if the Nameless One himself should come, not \\neven he could enter here while we yet live.\\' But some answered: \\'While we \\nyet live? How long? He has a weapon that has brought low many strong places \\nsince the world began. Hunger. The roads are cut. Rohan will not come.\\' \\n\\nBut the engines did not waste shot upon the indomitable wall. It was no \\nbrigand or ore-chieftain that ordered the assault upon the Lord of Mordor\\'s \\ngreatest foe. A power and mind of malice guided it. As soon as the great \\ncatapults were set, with many yells and the creaking of rope and winch, they \\nbegan to throw missiles marvellously high, so that they passed right above \\nthe battlement and fell thudding within the first circle of the City; and \\nmany of them by some secret art burst into flame as they came toppling down. \\n\\nSoon there was great peril of fire behind the wall, and all who could \\nbe spared were busy quelling the flames that sprang up in many places. Then \\namong the greater casts there fell another hail, less ruinous but more \\nhorrible. All about the streets and lanes behind the Gate it tumbled down, \\nsmall round shot that did not burn. But when men ran to learn what it might \\nbe, they cried aloud or wept. For the enemy was flinging into the City all \\nthe heads of those who had fallen fighting at Osgiliath, or on the Rammas, \\nor in the fields. They were grim to look on; for though some were crushed \\nand shapeless, and some had been cruelly hewn, yet many had features that \\ncould be told, and it seemed that they had died in pain; and all were \\nbranded with the foul token of the Lidless Eye. But marred and dishonoured \\nas they were, it often chanced that thus a man would see again the face of \\nsomeone that he had known, who had walked proudly once in arms, or tilled \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe fields, or ridden in upon a holiday from the green vales in the hills. \\n\\nIn vain men shook their fists at the pitiless foes that swarmed before \\nthe Gate. Curses they heeded not, nor understood the tongues of western men; \\ncrying with harsh voices like beasts and carrion-birds. But soon there were \\nfew left in Minas Tirith who had the heart to stand up and defy the hosts of \\nMordor. For yet another weapon, swifter than hunger, the Lord of the Dark \\nTower had: dread and despair. \\n\\nThe Nazgyl came again, and as their Dark Lord now grew and put forth \\nhis strength, so their voices, which uttered only his will and his malice, \\nwere filled with evil and horror. Ever they circled above the City, like \\nvultures that expect their fill of doomed men\\'s flesh. Out of sight and shot \\nthey flew, and yet were ever present, and their deadly voices rent the air. \\n\\nMore unbearable they became, not less, at each new cry. At length even the \\nstout-hearted would fling themselves to the ground as the hidden menace \\npassed over them, or they would stand, letting their weapons fall from \\nnerveless hands while into their minds a blackness came, and they thought no \\nmore of war, but only of hiding and of crawling, and of death. \\n\\nDuring all this black day Faramir lay upon his bed in the chamber of \\nthe White Tower, wandering in a desperate fever; dying someone said, and \\nsoon \\'dying\\' all men were saying upon the walls and in the streets. And by \\nhim his father sat, and said nothing, but watched, and gave no longer any \\nheed to the defence. \\n\\nNo hours so dark had Pippin known, not even in the clutches of the \\nUruk-hai. It was his duty to wait upon the Lord, and wait he did, forgotten \\nit seemed, standing by the door of the unlit chamber, mastering his own \\nfears as best he could. And as he watched, it seemed to him that Denethor \\ngrew old before his eyes, as if something had snapped in his proud will, and \\nhis stern mind was overthrown. Grief maybe had wrought it, and remorse. He \\nsaw tears on that once tearless face, more unbearable than wrath. \\n\\n\\'Do not weep, lord,\\' he stammered. \\'Perhaps he will get well. Have you \\nasked Gandalf?\\' \\n\\n\\'Comfort me not with wizards!\\' said Denethor. \\'The fool\\'s hope has \\nfailed. The Enemy has found it, and now his power waxes; he sees our very \\nthoughts, and all we do is ruinous. \\n\\n\\'I sent my son forth, unthanked, unblessed, out into needless peril, \\nand here he lies with poison in his veins. Nay, nay, whatever may now betide \\nin war, my line too is ending, even the House of the Stewards has failed. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMean folk shall rule the last remnant of the Kings of Men, lurking in the \\nhills until all are hounded out.\\' \\n\\nMen came to the door crying for the Lord of the City. \\'Nay, I will not \\ncome down,\\' he said. \\'I must stay beside my son. He might still speak before \\nthe end. But that is near. Follow whom you will, even the Grey Fool, though \\nhis hope has failed. Here I stay.\\' \\n\\nSo it was that Gandalf took command of the last defence of the City of \\nGondor. Wherever he came men\\'s hearts would lift again, and the winged \\nshadows pass from memory. Tirelessly he strode from Citadel to Gate, from \\nnorth to south about the wall; and with him went the Prince of Dol Amroth in \\nhis shining mail. For he and his knights still held themselves like lords in \\nwhom the race ofN(r)menor ran true. Men that saw them whispered saying: \\n\\'Belike the old tales speak well; there is Elvish blood in the veins of that \\nfolk, for the people of Nimrodel dwelt in that land once long ago.\\' And then \\none would sing amid the gloom some staves of the Lay of Nimrodel, or other \\nsongs of the Vale of Anduin out of vanished years. \\n\\nAnd yet - when they had gone, the shadows closed on men again, and \\ntheir hearts went cold, and the valour of Gondor withered into ash. And so \\nslowly they passed out of a dim day of fears into the darkness of a \\ndesperate night. Fires now raged unchecked in the first circle of the City, \\nand the garrison upon the outer wall was already in many places cut off from \\nretreat. But the faithful who remained there at their posts were few; most \\nhad fled beyond the second gate. \\n\\nFar behind the battle the River had been swiftly bridged, and all day \\nmore force and gear of war had poured across. Now at last in the middle \\nnight the assault was loosed. The vanguard passed through the trenches of \\nfire by many devious paths that had been left between them. On they came, \\nreckless of their loss as they approached, still bunched and herded, within \\nthe range of bowmen on the wall. But indeed there were too few now left \\nthere to do them great damage, though the light of the fires showed up many \\na mark for archers of such skill as Gondor once had boasted. Then perceiving \\nthat the valour of the City was already beaten down, the hidden Captain put \\nforth his strength. Slowly the great siege-towers built in Osgiliath rolled \\nforward through the dark. \\n\\nMessengers came again to the chamber in the White Tower, and Pippin let \\nthem enter, for they were urgent. Denethor turned his head slowly from \\nFaramir\\'s face, and looked at them silently. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'The first circle of the City is burning, lord,\\' they said. \\'What are \\nyour commands? You are still the Lord and Steward. Not all will follow \\nMithrandir. Men are flying from the walls and leaving them unmanned.\\' \\n\\n\\'Why? Why do the fools fly?\\' said Denethor. \\'Better to burn sooner than \\nlate, for burn we must. Go back to your bonfire! And I? I will go now to my \\npyre. To my pyre! No tomb for Denethor and Faramir. No tomb! No long \\nslow \\n\\nsleep of death embalmed. We will burn like heathen kings before ever a ship \\nsailed hither from the West. The West has failed. Go back and burn!\\' \\n\\nThe messengers without bow or answer turned and fled. \\n\\nNow Denethor stood up and released the fevered hand of Faramir that he \\nhad held. \\'Fie is burning, already burning,\\' he said sadly. \\'The house of his \\nspirit crumbles.\\' Then stepping softly towards Pippin he looked down at him. \\n\\n\\'Farewell!\\' he said. \\'Farewell, Peregrin son of Paladin! Your service \\nhas been short, and now it is drawing to an end. I release you from the \\nlittle that remains. Go now, and die in what way seems best to you. And with \\nwhom you will, even that friend whose folly brought you to this death. Send \\nfor my servants and then go. Farewell!\\' \\n\\n\\'I will not say farewell, my lord,\\' said Pippin kneeling. And then \\nsuddenly hobbit-like once more, he stood up and looked the old man in the \\neyes. \\'I will take your leave, sir,\\' he said; \\'for I want to see Gandalf \\nvery much indeed. But he is no fool; and I will not think of dying until he \\ndespairs of life. But from my word and your service I do not wish to be \\nreleased while you live. And if they come at last to the Citadel, I hope to \\nbe here and stand beside you and earn perhaps the arms that you have given \\nme.\\' \\n\\n\\'Do as you will, Master Halfling,\\' said Denethor. \\'But my life is \\nbroken. Send for my servants!\\' He turned back to Faramir. \\n\\nPippin left him and called for the servants, and they came: six men of \\nthe household, strong and fair; yet they trembled at the summons. But in a \\nquiet voice Denethor bade them lay warm coverlets on Faramir\\'s bed and take \\nit up. And they did so, and lifting up the bed they bore it from the \\nchamber. Slowly they paced to trouble the fevered man as little as might be, \\nand Denethor, now bending on a staff, followed them; and last came Pippin. \\n\\nOut from the White Tower they walked, as if to a funeral, out into the \\ndarkness, where the overhanging cloud was lit beneath with flickers of dull \\nred. Softly they paced the great courtyard, and at a word from Denethor \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhalted beside the Withered Tree. \\n\\nAll was silent, save for the rumour of war in the City down below, and \\nthey heard the water dripping sadly from the dead branches into the dark \\npool. Then they went on through the Citadel gate, where the sentinel stared \\nat them in wonder and dismay as they passed by. Turning westward they came \\nat length to a door in the rearward wall of the sixth circle. Fen Hollen it \\nwas called, for it was kept ever shut save at times of funeral, and only the \\nLord of the City might use that way, or those who bore the token of the \\ntombs and tended the houses of the dead. Beyond it went a winding road that \\ndescended in many curves down to the narrow land under the shadow of \\nMindolluin\\'s precipice where stood the mansions of the dead Kings and of \\ntheir Stewards. \\n\\nA porter sat in a little house beside the way, and with fear in his \\neyes he came forth bearing a lantern in his hand. At the Lord\\'s command he \\nunlocked the door, and silently it swung back; and they passed through, \\ntaking the lantern from his hand. It was dark on the climbing road between \\nancient walls and many -pillared balusters looming in the swaying \\nlantern-beam. Their slow feet echoed as they walked down, down, until at \\nlast they came to the Silent Street, Rath Dnnen, between pale domes and \\nempty halls and images of men long dead; and they entered into the House of \\nthe Stewards and set down their burden. \\n\\nThere Pippin, staring uneasily about him, saw that he was in a wide \\nvaulted chamber, draped as it were with the great shadows that the little \\nlantern threw upon its shrouded walls. And dimly to be seen were many rows \\nof tables, carved of marble; and upon each table lay a sleeping form, hands \\nfolded, head pillowed upon stone. But one table near at hand stood broad and \\nbare. Upon it at a sign from Denethor they laid Faramir and his father side \\nby side, and covered them with one covering, and stood then with bowed heads \\nas mourners beside a bed of death. Then Denethor spoke in a low voice. \\n\\n\\'Here we will wait,\\' he said. \\'But send not for the embalmers. Bring us \\nwood quick to burn, and lay it all about us, and beneath; and pour oil upon \\nit. And when I bid you thrust in a torch. Do this and speak no more to me. \\nFarewell!\\' \\n\\n\\'By your leave, lord!\\' said Pippin and turned and fled in terror from \\nthe deathly house. \\'Poor Faramir!\\' he thought. \\'I must find Gandalf. Poor \\nFaramir! Quite likely he needs medicine more than tears. Oh, where can I \\nfind Gandalf? In the thick of things, I suppose; and he will have no time to \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nspare for dying men or madmen.\\' \\n\\nAt the door he turned to one of the servants who had remained on guard \\nthere. \\'Your master is not himself,\\' he said. \\'Go slow! Bring no fire to \\nthis place while Faramir lives! Do nothing until Gandalf comes!\\' \\n\\n\\'Who is the master of Minas Tirith?\\' the man answered. \\'The Lord \\nDenethor or the Grey Wanderer?\\' \\n\\n\\'The Grey Wanderer or no one, it would seem,\\' said Pippin, and he sped \\nback and up the winding way as swiftly as his feet would carry him, past the \\nastonished porter, out through the door, and on, till he came near the gate \\nof the Citadel. The sentinel hailed him as he went by, and he recognized the \\nvoice of Beregond. \\n\\n\\'Whither do you run, Master Peregrin?\\' he cried. \\n\\n\\'To find Mithrandir,\\' Pippin answered. \\n\\n\\'The Lord\\'s errands are urgent and should not be hindered by me,\\' said \\nBeregond; \\'but tell me quickly, if you may: what goes forward? Whither has \\nmy Lord gone? I have just come on duty, but I heard that he passed towards \\nthe Closed Door, and men were bearing Faramir before him.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Pippin, \\'to the Silent Street.\\' \\n\\nBeregond bowed his head to hide his tears. \\'They said that he was \\ndying,\\' he sighed, \\'and now he is dead.\\' \\n\\n\\'No,\\' said Pippin, \\'not yet. And even now his death might be prevented, \\n\\nI think. But the Lord of the City, Beregond, has fallen before his city is \\ntaken. Fie is fey and dangerous.\\' Quickly he told of Denethor\\'s strange words \\nand deeds. \\'I must find Gandalf at once.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then you must go down to the battle.\\' \\n\\n\\'I know. The Lord has given me leave. But, Beregond, if you can, do \\nsomething to stop any dreadful thing happening.\\' \\n\\n\\'The Lord does not permit those who wear the black and silver to leave \\ntheir post for any cause, save at his own command.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, you must choose between orders and the life of Faramir,\\' said \\nPippin. \\'And as for orders, I think you have a madman to deal with, not a \\nlord. I must run. I will return if I can.\\' \\n\\nHe ran on, down, down towards the outer city. Men flying back from the \\nburning passed him, and some seeing his livery turned and shouted, but he \\npaid no heed. At last he was through the Second Gate, beyond which great \\nfires leaped up between the walls. Yet it seemed strangely silent. No noise \\nor shouts of battle or din of arms could be heard. Then suddenly there was a \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndreadful cry and a great shock, and a deep echoing boom. Forcing himself on \\nagainst a gust of fear and horror that shook him almost to his knees. Pippin \\nturned a corner opening on the wide place behind the City Gate. He stopped \\ndead. He had found Gandalf; but he shrank back, cowering into a shadow. \\n\\nEver since the middle night the great assault had gone on. The drums \\nrolled. To the north and to the south company upon company of the enemy \\npressed to the walls. There came great beasts, like moving houses in the red \\nand fitful light, the mymakil of the Harad dragging through the lanes amid \\nthe fires huge towers and engines. Yet their Captain cared not greatly what \\nthey did or how many might be slain: their purpose was only to test the \\nstrength of the defence and to keep the men of Gondor busy in many places. \\nIt was against the Gate that he would throw his heaviest weight. Very strong \\nit might be, wrought of steel and iron, and guarded with towers and bastions \\nof indomitable stone, yet it was the key, the weakest point in all that high \\nand impenetrable wall. \\n\\nThe drums rolled louder. Fires leaped up. Great engines crawled across \\nthe field; and in the midst was a huge ram, great as a forest-tree a hundred \\nfeet in length, swinging on mighty chains. Long had it been forging in the \\ndark smithies of Mordor, and its hideous head, founded of black steel, was \\nshaped in the likeness of a ravening wolf; on it spells of ruin lay. Grond \\nthey named it, in memory of the Hammer of the Underworld of old. Great \\nbeasts drew it, Ores surrounded it, and behind walked mountain -trolls to \\nwield it. \\n\\nBut about the Gate resistance still was stout, and there the knights of \\nDol Amroth and the hardiest of the garrison stood at bay. Shot and dart fell \\nthick; siege-towers crashed or blazed suddenly like torches. All before the \\nwalls on either side of the Gate the ground was choked with wreck and with \\nbodies of the slain; yet still driven as by a madness more and more came up. \\n\\nGrond crawled on. Upon its housing no fire would catch; and though now \\nand again some great beast that hauled it would go mad and spread stamping \\nruin among the ores innumerable that guarded it, their bodies were cast \\naside from its path and others took their place. \\n\\nGrond crawled on. The drums rolled wildly. Over the hills of slain a \\nhideous shape appeared: a horseman, tall, hooded, cloaked in black. Slowly, \\ntrampling the fallen, he rode forth, heeding no longer any dart. He halted \\nand held up a long pale sword. And as he did so a great fear fell on all, \\ndefender and foe alike; and the hands of men drooped to their sides, and no \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbow sang. For a moment all was still. \\n\\nThe drums rolled and rattled. With a vast rush Grond was hurled forward \\nby huge hands. It reached the Gate. It swung. A deep boom rumbled through \\nthe City like thunder running in the clouds. But the doors of iron and posts \\nof steel withstood the stroke. \\n\\nThen the Black Captain rose in his stirrups and cried aloud in a \\ndreadful voice, speaking in some forgotten tongue words of power and terror \\nto rend both heart and stone. \\n\\nThrice he cried. Thrice the great ram boomed. And suddenly upon the \\nlast stroke the Gate of Gondor broke. As if stricken by some blasting spell \\nit burst asunder: there was a flash of searing lightning, and the doors \\ntumbled in riven fragments to the ground. \\n\\nIn rode the Lord of the Nazgyl. A great black shape against the fires \\nbeyond he loomed up, grown to a vast menace of despair. In rode the Lord of \\nthe Nazgyl, under the archway that no enemy ever yet had passed, and all \\nfled before his face. \\n\\nAll save one. There waiting, silent and still in the space before the \\nGate, sat Gandalf upon Shadowfax: Shadowfax who alone among the free \\nhorses \\n\\nof the earth endured the terror, unmoving, steadfast as a graven image in \\nRath Dnnen. \\n\\n\\'You cannot enter here,\\' said Gandalf, and the huge shadow halted. \\'Go \\nback to the abyss prepared for you! Go back! Fall into the nothingness that \\nawaits you and your Master. Go!\\' \\n\\nThe Black Rider flung back his hood, and behold! he had a kingly crown; \\nand yet upon no head visible was it set. The red fires shone between it and \\nthe mantled shoulders vast and dark. From a mouth unseen there came a deadly \\nlaughter. \\n\\n\\'Old fool!\\' he said. \\'Old fool! This is my hour. Do you not know Death \\nwhen you see it? Die now and curse in vain!\\' And with that he lifted high \\nhis sword and flames ran down the blade. \\n\\nGandalf did not move. And in that very moment, away behind in some \\ncourtyard of the City, a cock crowed. Shrill and clear he crowed, recking \\nnothing of wizardry or war, welcoming only the morning that in the sky far \\nabove the shadows of death was coming with the dawn. \\n\\nAnd as if in answer there came from far away another note. Horns, \\nhorns, horns. In dark Mindolluin\\'s sides they dimly echoed. Great horns of \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe North wildly blowing. Rohan had come at last. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 5 . The Ride of the Rohirrim \\n\\n\\n\\nIt was dark and Merry could see nothing as he lay on the ground rolled \\nin a blanket; yet though the night was airless and windless, all about him \\nhidden trees were sighing softly. He lifted his head. Then he heard it \\nagain: a sound like faint drums in the wooded hills and mountain -steps. The \\nthrob would cease suddenly and then be taken up again at some other point, \\nnow nearer, now further off. He wondered if the watchmen had heard it. \\n\\nHe could not see them, but he knew that all round him were the \\ncompanies of the Rohirrim. He could smell the horses in the dark, and could \\nhear their shiftings and their soft stamping on the needle-covered ground. \\n\\nThe host was bivouacked in the pine-woods that clustered about Eilenach \\nBeacon, a tall hill standing up from the long ridges of the Dr(r)adan Forest \\nthat lay beside the great road in East Anurien. \\n\\nTired as he was Merry could not sleep. He had ridden now for four days \\non end, and the ever -deepening gloom had slowly weighed down his heart. He \\nbegan to wonder why he had been so eager to come, when he had been given \\nevery excuse, even his lord\\'s command, to stay behind. He wondered, too, if \\nthe old King knew that he had been disobeyed and was angry. Perhaps not. \\nThere seemed to be some understanding between Dernhelm and Elfhelm, \\nthe \\n\\nMarshal who commanded the jored in which they were riding. He and all his \\nmen ignored Merry and pretended not to hear if he spoke. He might have been \\njust another bag that Dernhelm was carrying. Dernhelm was no comfort: he \\nnever spoke to anyone. Merry felt small, unwanted, and lonely. Now the time \\nwas anxious, and the host was in peril. They were less than a day\\'s ride \\nfrom the out- walls of Minas Tirith that encircled the townlands. Scouts had \\nbeen sent ahead. Some had not returned. Others hastening back had reported \\nthat the road was held in force against them. A host of the enemy was \\nencamped upon it, three miles west of Amon Don, and some strength of men \\nwas \\n\\nalready thrusting along the road and was no more than three leagues away. \\nOres were roving in the hills and woods along the roadside. The king and \\nJomer held council in the watches of the night. \\n\\nMerry wanted somebody to talk to, and he thought of Pippin. But that \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nonly increased his restlessness. Poor Pippin, shut up in the great city of \\nstone, lonely and afraid. Merry wished he was a tall Rider like Jomer and \\ncould blow a horn or something and go galloping to his rescue. He sat up, \\nlistening to the drums that were beating again, now nearer at hand. \\nPresently he heard voices speaking low, and he saw dim half-shrouded \\nlanterns passing through the trees. Men nearby began to move uncertainly in \\nthe dark. \\n\\nA tall figure loomed up and stumbled over him, cursing the tree-roots. \\n\\nHe recognized the voice of the Marshal, Elfhelm. \\n\\n\\'I am not a tree-root, Sir,\\' he said, \\'nor a bag, but a bruised hobbit. \\n\\nThe least you can do in amends is to tell me what is afoot.\\' \\n\\n\\'Anything that can keep so in this devil\\'s mirk,\\' answered Elfhelm. \\n\\n\\'But my lord sends word that we must set ourselves in readiness: orders may \\ncome for a sudden move.\\' \\n\\n\\'Is the enemy coming then?\\' asked Merry anxiously. \\'Are those their \\ndrums? I began to think I was imagining them, as no one else seemed to take \\nany notice of them.\\' \\n\\n\\'Nay, nay,\\' said Elfhelm, \\'the enemy is on the road not in the hills. \\n\\nYou hear the Woses, the Wild Men of the Woods: thus they talk together from \\nafar. They still haunt Dr(r)adan Forest, it is said. Remnants of an older time \\nthey be, living few and secretly, wild and wary as the beasts. They go not \\nto war with Gondor or the Mark; but now they are troubled by the darkness \\nand the coming of the ores: they fear lest the Dark Years be returning, as \\nseems likely enough. Let us be thankful that they are not hunting us: for \\nthey use poisoned arrows, it is said, and they are woodcrafty beyond \\ncompare. But they have offered their services to Thjoden. Even now one of \\ntheir headmen is being taken to the king. Yonder go the lights. So much I \\nhave heard but no more. And now I must busy myself with my lord\\'s \\ncommands. \\n\\nPack yourself up, Master Bag!\\' He vanished into the shadows. \\n\\nMerry did not like this talk of wild men and poisoned darts, but quite \\napart from that a great weight of dread was on him. Waiting was unbearable. \\nHe longed to know what was going to happen. He got up and soon was \\nwalking \\n\\nwarily in pursuit of the last lantern before it disappeared among the trees. \\n\\nPresently he came to an open space where a small tent had been set up \\nfor the king under a great tree. A large lantern, covered above, was hanging \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfrom a bough and cast a pale circle of light below. There sat Thjoden and \\nJomer, and before them on the ground sat a strange squat shape of a man, \\ngnarled as an old stone, and the hairs of his scanty beard straggled on his \\nlumpy chin like dry moss. He was short -legged and fat-armed, thick and \\nstumpy, and clad only with grass about his waist. Merry felt that he had \\nseen him before somewhere, and suddenly he remembered the P(r)kel-men \\nof \\n\\nDunharrow. Here was one of those old images brought to life, or maybe a \\ncreature descended in true line through endless years from the models used \\nby the forgotten craftsmen long ago. \\n\\nThere was a silence as Merry crept nearer, and then the Wild Man began \\nto speak, in answer to some question, it seemed. His voice was deep and \\nguttural, yet to Merry\\'s surprise he spoke the Common Speech, though in a \\nhalting fashion, and uncouth words were mingled with it. \\n\\n\\'No, father of Horse-men,\\' he said, \\'we fight not. Hunt only. Kill \\ngorgyn in woods, hate ore-folk. You hate gorgyn too. We help as we can. Wild \\nMen have long ears and long eyes; know all paths. Wild Men live here before \\nStone-houses; before Tall Men come up out of Water.\\' \\n\\n\\'But our need is for aid in battle,\\' said Jomer. \\'How will you and your \\nfolk help us?\\' \\n\\n\\'Bring news,\\' said the Wild Man. \\'We look out from hills. We climb big \\nmountain and look down. Stone-city is shut. Fire burns there outside; now \\ninside too. You wish to come there? Then you must be quick. But gorgyn and \\nmen out of far-away,\\' he waved a short gnarled arm eastward, \\'sit on \\nhorse-road. Very many, more than Horse-men.\\' \\n\\n\\'How do you know that?\\' said Jomer. \\n\\nThe old man\\'s flat face and dark eyes showed nothing, but his voice was \\nsullen with displeasure. \\'Wild men are wild, free, but not children,\\' he \\nanswered. \\'I am great headman, Ghvn-buri-Ghvn. I count many things: stars in \\nsky, leaves on trees, men in the dark. You have a score of scores counted \\nten times and five. They have more. Big fight, and who will win? And many \\nmore walk round walls of Stone-houses.\\' \\n\\n\\'Alas! he speaks all too shrewdly,\\' said Thjoden. \\'And our scouts say \\nthat they have cast trenches and stakes across the road. We cannot sweep \\nthem away in sudden onset.\\' \\n\\n\\'And yet we need great haste,\\' said Jomer. \\'Mundburg is on fire!\\' \\n\\n\\'Let Ghvn-buri-Ghvn finish!\\' said the Wild Man. \\'More than one road he \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nknows. He will lead you by road where no pits are, no gorgyn walk, only Wild \\nMen and beasts. Many paths were made when Stonehouse-folk were \\nstronger. \\n\\nThey carved hills as hunters carve beast-flesh. Wild Men think they ate \\nstone for food. They went through Dr(r)adan to Rimmon with great wains. \\nThey \\n\\ngo no longer. Road is forgotten, but not by Wild Men. Over hill and behind \\nhill it lies still under grass and tree, there behind Rimmon and down to \\nDon, and back at the end to Horse-men\\'s road. Wild Men will show you that \\nroad. Then you will kill gorgyn and drive away bad dark with bright iron, \\nand Wild Men can go back to sleep in the wild woods.\\' \\n\\nJomer and the king spoke together in their own tongue. At length \\nThjoden turned to the Wild Man. \\'We will receive your offer,\\' he said. \\'For \\nthough we leave a host of foes behind, what matter? If the Stone-city falls, \\nthen we shall have no returning. If it is saved, then the ore-host itself \\nwill be cut off. If you are faithful, Ghvn-buri-Ghvn, then we will give you \\nrich reward, and you shall have the friendship of the Mark for ever.\\' \\n\\n\\'Dead men are not friends to living men, and give them no gifts,\\' said \\nthe Wild Man. \\'But if you live after the Darkness, then leave Wild Men alone \\nin the woods and do not hunt them like beasts any more. Ghvn-buri-Ghvn will \\nnot lead you into trap. He will go himself with father of Horse-men, and if \\nhe leads you wrong, you will kill him.\\' \\n\\n\\'So be it!\\' said Thjoden. \\n\\n\\'How long will it take to pass by the enemy and come back to the road?\\' \\nasked Jomer. \\'We must go at foot-pace, if you guide us; and I doubt not the \\nway is narrow.\\' \\n\\n\\'Wild Men go quick on feet,\\' said Ghvn. \\'Way is wide for four horses in \\nStonewain Valley yonder,\\' he waved his hand southwards; \\'but narrow at \\nbeginning and at end. Wild Man could walk from here to Don between sunrise \\nand noon.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then we must allow at least seven hours for the leaders,\\' said Jomer; \\n\\n\\'but we must reckon rather on some ten hours for all. Things unforeseen may \\nhinder us, and if our host is all strung out, it will be long ere it can be \\nset in order when we issue from the hills. What is the hour now?\\' \\n\\n\\'Who knows?\\' said Thjoden. \\'All is night now.\\' \\n\\n\\'It is all dark, but it is not all night.\\' said Ghvn. \\'When Sun comes \\nwe feel her, even when she is hidden. Already she climbs over \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEast -mountains. It is the opening of day in the sky-fields.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then we must set out as soon as may be,\\' said Jomer. \\'Even so we \\ncannot hope to come to Gondor\\'s aid today.\\' \\n\\nMerry waited to hear no more, but slipped away to get ready for the \\nsummons to the march. This was the last stage before the battle. It did not \\nseem likely to him that many of them would survive it. But he thought of \\nPippin and the flames in Minas Tirith and thrust down his own dread. \\n\\nAll went well that day, and no sight or sound had they of the enemy \\nwaiting to waylay them. The Wild Men had put out a screen of wary hunters, \\nso that no ore or roving spy should learn of the movements in the hills. The \\nlight was more dim than ever as they drew nearer to the beleaguered city, \\nand the Riders passed in long files like dark shadows of men and horses. \\nEach company was guided by a wild woodman; but old Ghvn walked beside \\nthe \\n\\nking. The start had been slower than was hoped, for it had taken time for \\nthe Riders, walking and leading their horses, to find paths over the thickly \\nwooded ridges behind their camp and down into the hidden Stonewain Valley. \\nIt was late in the afternoon when the leaders came to wide grey thickets \\nstretching beyond the eastward side of Amon Don, and masking a great gap in \\nthe line of hills that from Nardol to Don ran east and west. Through the gap \\nthe forgotten wain-road long ago had run down, back into the main horse-way \\nfrom the City through Anurien; but now for many lives of men trees had had \\ntheir way with it, and it had vanished, broken and buried under the leaves \\nof uncounted years. But the thickets offered to the Riders their last hope \\nof cover before they went into open battle; for beyond them lay the road and \\nthe plains of Anduin, while east and southwards the slopes were bare and \\nrocky, as the writhen hills gathered themselves together and climbed up, \\nbastion upon bastion, into the great mass and shoulders of Mindolluin. \\n\\nThe leading company was halted, and as those behind filed up out of the \\ntrough of the Stonewain Valley they spread out and passed to camping -places \\nunder the grey trees. The king summoned the captains to council. Jomer sent \\nout scouts to spy upon the road; but old Ghvn shook his head. \\n\\n\\'No good to send Horse-men,\\' he said. \\'Wild Men have already seen all \\nthat can be seen in the bad air. They will come soon and speak to me here.\\' \\n\\nThe captains came; and then out of the trees crept warily other \\np(r)kel-shapes so like old Ghvn that Merry could hardly tell them apart. They \\nspoke to Ghvn in a strange throaty language. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPresently Ghvn turned to the king. \\'Wild Men say many things \\' he said. \\n\\'First, be wary! Still many men in camp beyond Don, an hour\\'s walk yonder,\\' \\nhe waved his arm west towards the black beacon. \\'But none to see between \\nhere and Stone-folk\\'s new walls. Many busy there. Walls stand up no longer: \\ngorgyn knock them down with earth-thunder and with clubs of black iron. They \\nare unwary and do not look about them. They think their friends watch all \\nroads!\\' At that old Ghvn made a curious gurgling noise, and it seemed that \\nhe was laughing. \\n\\n\\'Good tidings!\\' cried Jomer. \\'Even in this gloom hope gleams again. Our \\nEnemy\\'s devices oft serve us in his despite. The accursed darkness itself \\nhas been a cloak to us. And now, lusting to destroy Gondor and throw it down \\nstone from stone, his ores have taken away my greatest fear. The out-wall \\ncould have been held long against us. Now we can sweep through - if once we \\nwin so far.\\' \\n\\n\\'Once again I thank you, Ghvn-buri-Ghvn of the woods,\\' said Thjoden. \\n\\'Good fortune go with you for tidings and for guidance!\\' \\n\\n\\'Kill gorgynl Kill ore-folk! No other words please Wild Men \\' answered \\nGhvn. \\'Drive away bad air and darkness with bright iron!\\' \\n\\n\\'To do these things we have ridden far,\\' said the king, \\'and we shall \\nattempt them. But what we shall achieve only tomorrow will show.\\' \\n\\nGhvn-buri-Ghvn squatted down and touched the earth with his horny brow \\nin token of farewell. Then he got up as if to depart. But suddenly he stood \\nlooking up like some startled woodland animal snuffling a strange air. A \\nlight came in his eyes. \\n\\n\\'Wind is changing!\\' he cried, and with that, in a twinkling as it \\nseemed, he and his fellows had vanished into the glooms, never to be seen by \\nany Rider of Rohan again. Not long after far away eastward the faint drums \\nthrobbed again. Yet to no heart in all the host came any fear that the Wild \\nMen were unfaithful, strange and unlovely though they might appear. \\n\\n\\'We need no further guidance,\\' said Elfhelm; \\'for there are riders in \\nthe host who have ridden down to Mundburg in days of peace. I for one. When \\nwe come to the road it will veer south, and there will lie before us still \\nseven leagues ere we reach the wall of the townlands. Along most of that way \\nthere is much grass on either side of the road. On that stretch the \\nerrand-riders of Gondor reckoned to make their greatest speed. We may ride \\nit swiftly and without great rumour.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then since we must look for fell deeds and the need of all our \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstrength,\\' said Jomer, \\'I counsel that we rest now, and set out hence by \\nnight, and so time our going that we come upon the fields when tomorrow is \\nas light as it will be, or when our lord gives the signal.\\' \\n\\nTo this the king assented, and the captains departed. But soon Elfhelm \\nreturned. \\'The scouts have found naught to report beyond the grey wood, \\nlord,\\' he said, \\'save two men only: two dead men and two dead horses.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well?\\' said Jomer. \\'What of it?\\' \\n\\n\\'This, lord: they were errand-riders of Gondor; Hirgon was one maybe. \\n\\nAt least his hand still clasped the Red Arrow, but his head was hewn off. \\n\\nAnd this also: it would seem by the signs that they were fleeing westward \\nwhen they fell. As I read it, they found the enemy already on the out-wall, \\nor assailing it, when they returned - and that would be two nights ago, if \\nthey used fresh horses from the posts, as is their wont. They could not \\nreach the City and turned back.\\' \\n\\n\\'Alas!\\' said Thjoden. \\'Then Denethor has heard no news of our riding \\nand will despair of our coming.\\' \\n\\n\\'Need brooks no delay, yet late is better than never,\\' said Jomer. \\'And \\nmayhap in this time shall the old saw be proved truer than ever before since \\nmen spoke with mouth.\\' \\n\\nIt was night. On either side of the road the host of Rohan was moving \\nsilently. Now the road passing about the skirts of Mindolluin turned \\nsouthward. Far away and almost straight ahead there was a red glow under the \\nblack sky and the sides of the great mountain loomed dark against it. They \\nwere drawing near the Rammas of the Pelennor; but the day was not yet come. \\n\\nThe king rode in the midst of the leading company, his household-men \\nabout him. Elfhelm\\'s jored came next; and now Merry noticed that Dernhelm \\nhad left his place and in the darkness was moving steadily forward, until at \\nlast he was riding just in rear of the king\\'s guard. There came a check. \\n\\nMerry heard voices in front speaking softly. Out-riders had come back who \\nhad ventured forward almost to the wall. They came to the king. \\n\\n\\'There are great fires, lord,\\' said one. \\'The City is all set about \\nwith flame, and the field is full of foes. But all seem drawn off to the \\nassault. As well as we could guess, there are few left upon the out-wall, \\nand they are heedless, busy in destruction.\\' \\n\\n\\'Do you remember the Wild Man\\'s words, lord?\\' said another. \\'I live \\nupon the open Wold in days of peace; Wndfara is my name, and to me also the \\nair brings messages. Already the wind is turning. There comes a breath out \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nof the South; there is a sea -tang in it, faint though it be. The morning \\nwill bring new things. Above the reek it will be dawn when you pass the \\nwall.\\' \\n\\n\\'If you speak truly, Wndfara, then may you live beyond this day in \\nyears of blessedness!\\' said Thjoden. He turned to the men of his household \\nwho were near, and he spoke now in a clear voice so that many also of the \\nriders of the first jored heard him: \\n\\n\\'Now is the hour come, Riders of the Mark, sons of Eorl! Foes and fire \\nare before you, and your homes far behind. Yet, though you fight upon an \\nalien field, the glory that you reap there shall be your own for ever. Oaths \\nye have taken: now fulfil them all, to lord and land and league of \\nfriendship!\\' \\n\\nMen clashed spear upon shield. \\n\\n\\'Jomer, my son! You lead the first jored\\' said Thjoden; \\'and it shall \\ngo behind the king\\'s banner in the centre. Elfhelm, lead your company to the \\nright when we pass the wall. And Grimbold shall lead his towards the left. \\nLet the other companies behind follow these three that lead, as they have \\nchance. Strike wherever the enemy gathers. Other plans we cannot make, for \\nwe know not yet how things stand upon the field. Forth now, and fear no \\ndarkness!\\' \\n\\nThe leading company rode off as swiftly as they could, for it was still \\ndeep dark, whatever change Wndfara might forebode. Merry was riding \\nbehind \\n\\nDernhelm, clutching with the left hand while with the other he tried to \\nloosen his sword in its sheath. He felt now bitterly the truth of the old \\nking\\'s words: in such a battle what would you do Meriadoc? Just this,\\' he \\nthought: \\'encumber a rider, and hope at best to stay in my seat and not be \\npounded to death by galloping hoofs!\\' \\n\\nIt was no more than a league to where the out-walls had stood. They \\nsoon reached them; too soon for Merry. Wild cries broke out, and there was \\nsome clash of arms, but it was brief. The ores busy about the walls were few \\nand amazed, and they were quickly slain or driven off. Before the ruin of \\nthe north-gate in the Rammas the king halted again. The first jored drew up \\nbehind him and about him on either side. Dernhelm kept close to the king, \\nthough Elfhelm\\'s company was away on the right. Grimbold\\'s men turned \\naside \\n\\nand passed round to a great gap in the wall further eastward. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMerry peered from behind Dernhelm\\'s back. Far away, maybe ten miles or \\nmore, there was a great burning, but between it and the Riders lines of fire \\nblazed in a vast crescent, at the nearest point less than a league distant. \\n\\nHe could make out little more on the dark plain, and as yet he neither saw \\nany hope of morning, nor felt any wind, changed or unchanged. \\n\\nNow silently the host of Rohan moved forward into the field of Gondor, \\npouring in slowly but steadily, like the rising tide through breaches in a \\ndike that men have thought secure. But the mind and will of the Black \\nCaptain were bent wholly on the falling city, and as yet no tidings came to \\nhim warning that his designs held any flaw. \\n\\nAfter a while the king led his men away somewhat eastward, to come \\nbetween the fires of the siege and the outer fields. Still they were \\nunchallenged, and still Thjoden gave no signal. At last he halted once \\nagain. The City was now nearer. A smell of burning was in the air and a very \\nshadow of death. The horses were uneasy. But the king sat upon Snowmane, \\nmotionless, gazing upon the agony of Minas Tirith, as if stricken suddenly \\nby anguish, or by dread. He seemed to shrink down, cowed by age. Merry \\nhimself felt as if a great weight of horror and doubt had settled on him. \\n\\nHis heart beat slowly. Time seemed poised in uncertainty. They were too \\nlate! Too late was worse than never! Perhaps Thjoden would quail, bow his \\nold head, turn, slink away to hide in the hills. \\n\\nThen suddenly Merry felt it at last, beyond doubt: a change. Wind was \\nin his face! Light was glimmering. Far, far away, in the South the clouds \\ncould be dimly seen as remote grey shapes, rolling up, drifting: morning lay \\nbeyond them. \\n\\nBut at that same moment there was a flash, as if lightning had sprung \\nfrom the earth beneath the City. For a searing second it stood dazzling far \\noff in black and white, its topmost tower like a glittering needle: and then \\nas the darkness closed again there came rolling over the fields a great \\nboom. \\n\\nAt that sound the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly erect. Tall \\nand proud he seemed again; and rising in his stirrups he cried in a loud \\nvoice, more clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before: \\nArise, arise, Riders of Thjoden! \\n\\nFell deeds awake: fire and slaughter! \\nspear shall be shaken, shield be splintered, \\na sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises! \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRide now, ride now! Ride to Gondor! \\n\\nWith that he seized a great horn from Guthlbf his banner-bearer, and he \\nblew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder. And straightway all the \\nhorns in the host were lifted up in music, and the blowing of the horns of \\nRohan in that hour was like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the \\nmountains. \\n\\nRide now, ride now! Ride to Gondor! \\n\\nSuddenly the king cried to Snowmane and the horse sprang away. Behind \\nhim his banner blew in the wind, white horse upon a field of green, but he \\noutpaced it. After him thundered the knights of his house, but he was ever \\nbefore them. Jomer rode there, the white horsetail on his helm floating in \\nhis speed, and the front of the first jored roared like a breaker foaming to \\nthe shore, but Thjoden could not be overtaken. Fey he seemed, or the \\nbattle-fury of his fathers ran like new tire in his veins, and he was borne \\nup on Snowmane like a god of old, even as Oroml the Great in the battle of \\nthe Valar when the world was young. His golden shield was uncovered, and lo \\nit shone like an image of the Sun, and the grass flamed into green about the \\nwhite feet of his steed. For morning came, morning and a wind from the sea; \\nand the darkness was removed, and the hosts of Mordor wailed, and terror \\ntook them, and they fled, and died, and the hoofs of wrath rode over them. \\nAnd then all the host of Rohan burst into song, and they sang as they slew, \\nfor the joy of battle was on them, and the sound of their singing that was \\nfair and terrible came even to the City. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 6 . The Battle of the Pelennor \\nFields \\n\\nBut it was no orc-chieftain or brigand that led the assault upon \\nGondor. The darkness was breaking too soon, before the date that his Master \\nhad set for it: fortune had betrayed him for the moment, and the world had \\nturned against him; victory was slipping from his grasp even as he stretched \\nout his hand to seize it. But his arm was long. He was still in command, \\nwielding great powers. King, Ringwraith, Lord of the Nazgyl, he had many \\nweapons. He left the Gate and vanished. \\n\\nThjoden King of the Mark had reached the road from the Gate to the \\nRiver, and he turned towards the City that was now less than a mile distant. \\n\\nHe slackened his speed a little, seeking new foes, and his knights came \\nabout him, and Dernhelm was with them. Ahead nearer the walls Elfhelm\\'s \\nmen \\n\\nwere among the siege-engines, hewing, slaying, driving their foes into the \\nfire-pits. Well nigh all the northern half of the Pelennor was overrun, and \\nthere camps were blazing, ores were flying towards the River like herds \\nbefore the hunters; and the Rohirrim went hither and thither at their will. \\n\\nBut they had not yet overthrown the siege, nor won the Gate. Many foes stood \\nbefore it, and on the further half of the plain were other hosts still \\nunfought. Southward beyond the road lay the main force of the Haradrim, and \\nthere their horsemen were gathered about the standard of their chieftain. \\n\\nAnd he looked out, and in the growing light he saw the banner of the king, \\nand that it was far ahead of the battle with few men about it. Then he was \\nfilled with a red wrath and shouted aloud, and displaying his standard, \\nblack serpent upon scarlet, he came against the white horse and the green \\nwith great press of men; and the drawing of the scimitars of the Southrons \\nwas like a glitter of stars. \\n\\nThen Thjoden was aware of him, and would not wait for his onset, but \\ncrying to Snowmane he charged headlong to greet him. Great was the clash of \\ntheir meeting. But the white fury of the Northmen burned the hotter, and \\nmore skilled was their knighthood with long spears and bitter. Fewer were \\nthey but they clove through the Southrons like a fire-bolt in a forest. \\n\\nRight through the press drove Thjoden Thengel\\'s son, and his spear was \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nshivered as he threw down their chieftain. Out swept his sword, and he \\nspurred to the standard, hewed staff and bearer; and the black serpent \\nfoundered. Then all that was left unslain of their cavalry turned and fled \\nfar away. \\n\\nBut lo ! suddenly in the midst of the glory of the king his golden \\nshield was dimmed. The new morning was blotted from the sky. Dark fell \\nabout \\n\\nhim. Horses reared and screamed. Men cast from the saddle lay grovelling on \\nthe ground. \\n\\nTo me! To me!\\' cried Thjoden. \\'Up Eorlingas! Fear no darkness!\\' But \\nSnowmane wild with terror stood up on high, fighting with the air, and then \\nwith a great scream he crashed upon his side: a black dart had pierced him. \\nThe king fell beneath him. \\n\\nThe great shadow descended like a falling cloud. And behold! it was a \\nwinged creature: if bird, then greater than all other birds, and it was \\nnaked, and neither quill nor feather did it bear, and its vast pinions were \\nas webs of hide between horned fingers; and it stank. A creature of an older \\nworld maybe it was, whose kind, fingering in forgotten mountains cold \\nbeneath the Moon, outstayed their day, and in hideous eyrie bred this last \\nuntimely brood, apt to evil. And the Dark Lord took it, and nursed it with \\nfell meats, until it grew beyond the measure of all other things that fly; \\nand he gave it to his servant to be his steed. Down, down it came, and then, \\nfolding its fingered webs, it gave a croaking cry, and settled upon the body \\nof Snowmane, digging in its claws, stooping its long naked neck. \\n\\nUpon it sat a shape, black -mantled, huge and threatening. A crown of \\nsteel he bore, but between rim and robe naught was there to see, save only a \\ndeadly gleam of eyes: the Lord of the Nazgyl. To the air he had returned, \\nsummoning his steed ere the darkness failed, and now he was come again, \\nbringing ruin, turning hope to despair, and victory to death. A great black \\nmace he wielded. \\n\\nBut Thjoden was not utterly forsaken. The knights of his house lay \\nslain about him, or else mastered by the madness of their steeds were borne \\nfar away. Yet one stood there still: Dernhelm the young, faithful beyond \\nfear; and he wept, for he had loved his lord as a father. Right through the \\ncharge Merry had been borne unharmed behind him, until the Shadow came; \\nand \\n\\nthen Windfola had thrown them in his terror, and now ran wild upon the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nplain. Merry crawled on all fours like a dazed beast, and such a horror was \\non him that he was blind and sick. \\n\\n\\'King\\'s man! King\\'s man!\\' his heart cried within him. \\'You must stay by \\nhim. As a father you shall be to me, you said.\\' But his will made no answer, \\nand his body shook. He dared not open his eyes or look up. \\n\\nThen out of the blackness in his mind he thought that he heard Dernhelm \\nspeaking; yet now the voice seemed strange, recalling some other voice that \\nhe had known. \\n\\n\\'Begone, foul dwimmerlaik, lord of carrion! Leave the dead in peace!\\' \\n\\nA cold voice answered: \\'Come not between the Nazgyl and his prey! Or he \\nwill not slay thee in thy turn. He will bear thee away to the houses of \\nlamentation, beyond all darkness, where thy flesh shall be devoured, and thy \\nshrivelled mind be left naked to the Lidless Eye.\\' \\n\\nA sword rang as it was drawn. \\'Do what you will; but I will hinder it, \\nif I may.\\' \\n\\n\\'Hinder me? Thou fool. No living man may hinder me!\\' \\n\\nThen Merry heard of all sounds in that hour the strangest. It seemed \\nthat Dernhelm laughed, and the clear voice was like the ring of steel. \\'But \\nno living man am I! You look upon a woman. Jowyn I am, Jomund\\'s \\ndaughter. \\n\\nYou stand between me and my lord and kin. Begone, if you be not deathless! \\nFor living or dark undead, I will smite you, if you touch him.\\' \\n\\nThe winged creature screamed at her, but the Ringwraith made no answer, \\nand was silent, as if in sudden doubt. Very amazement for a moment conquered \\nMerry\\'s fear. He opened his eyes and the blackness was lifted from them. \\nThere some paces from him sat the great beast, and all seemed dark about it, \\nand above it loomed the Nazgyl Lord like a shadow of despair. A little to \\nthe left facing them stood she whom he had called Dernhelm. But the helm of \\nher secrecy, had fallen from her, and her bright hair, released from its \\nbonds, gleamed with pale gold upon her shoulders. Her eyes grey as the sea \\nwere hard and fell, and yet tears were on her cheek. A sword was in her \\nhand, and she raised her shield against the horror of her enemy\\'s eyes. \\n\\nJowyn it was, and Dernhelm also. For into Merry\\'s mind flashed the \\nmemory of the face that he saw at the riding from Dunharrow: the face of one \\nthat goes seeking death, having no hope. Pity filled his heart and great \\nwonder, and suddenly the slow-kindled courage of his race awoke. He clenched \\nhis hand. She should not die, so fair, so desperate At least she should not \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndie alone, unaided. \\n\\nThe face of their enemy was not turned towards him, but still he hardly \\ndared to move, dreading lest the deadly eyes should fall on him. Slowly, \\nslowly he began to crawl aside; but the Black Captain, in doubt and malice \\nintent upon the woman before him, heeded him no more than a worm in the \\nmud. \\n\\nSuddenly the great beast beat its hideous wings, and the wind of them \\nwas foul. Again it leaped into the air, and then swiftly fell down upon \\nJowyn, shrieking, striking with beak and claw. \\n\\nStill she did not blench: maiden of the Rohirrim, child of kings, \\nslender but as a steel-blade, fair but terrible. A swift stroke she dealt, \\nskilled and deadly. The outstretched neck she clove asunder, and the hewn \\nhead fell like a stone. Backward she sprang as the huge shape crashed to \\nruin, vast wings outspread, crumpled on the earth; and with its fall the \\nshadow passed away. A light fell about her, and her hair shone in the \\nsunrise. \\n\\nOut of the wreck rose the Black Rider, tall and threatening, towering \\nabove her. With a cry of hatred that stung the very ears like venom he let \\nfall his mace. Her shield was shivered in many pieces, and her arm was \\nbroken; she stumbled to her knees. He bent over her like a cloud, and his \\neyes glittered; he raised his mace to kill. \\n\\nBut suddenly he too stumbled forward with a cry of bitter pain, and his \\nstroke went wide, driving into the ground. Merry\\'s sword had stabbed him \\nfrom behind, shearing through the black mantle, and passing up beneath the \\nhauberk had pierced the sinew behind his mighty knee. \\n\\n\\'Jowyn! Jowyn!\\' cried Merry. Then tottering, struggling up, with her \\nlast strength she drove her sword between crown and mantle, as the great \\nshoulders bowed before her. The sword broke sparkling into many shards. The \\ncrown rolled away with a clang. Jowyn fell forward upon her fallen foe. But \\nlo! the mantle and hauberk were empty. Shapeless they lay now on the ground, \\ntorn and tumbled; and a cry went up into the shuddering air, and faded to a \\nshrill wailing, passing with the wind, a voice bodiless and thin that died, \\nand was swallowed up, and was never heard again in that age of this world. \\n\\nAnd there stood Meriadoc the hobbit in the midst of the slain, blinking \\nlike an owl in the daylight, for tears blinded him; and through a mist he \\nlooked on Jowyn\\' s fair head, as she lay and did not move; and he looked on \\nthe face of the king, fallen in the midst of his glory, For Snowmane in his \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nagony had rolled away from him again; yet he was the bane of his master. \\n\\nThen Merry stooped and lifted his hand to kiss it, and lo! Thjoden \\nopened his eyes, and they were clear, and he spoke in a quiet voice though \\nlaboured. \\n\\n\\'Farewell, Master Holbytla!\\' he said. \\'My body is broken. I go to my \\nfathers. And even in their mighty company I shall not now be ashamed. I \\nfelled the black serpent. A grim morn, and a glad day, and a golden sunset!\\' \\n\\nMerry could not speak, but wept anew. \\'Forgive me, lord,\\' he said at \\nlast, \\'if I broke your command, and yet have done no more in your service \\nthan to weep at our parting.\\' \\n\\nThe old king smiled. \\'Grieve not! It is forgiven. Great heart will not \\nbe denied. Live now in blessedness; and when you sit in peace with your \\npipe, think of me! For never now shall I sit with you in Meduseld, as I \\npromised, or listen to your herb-lore.\\' He closed his eyes, and Merry bowed \\nbeside him. Presently he spoke again. \\'Where is Jomer? For my eyes darken, \\nand I would see him ere I go. He must be king after me. And I would send \\nword to Jowyn. She, she would not have me leave her, and now I shall not see \\nher again, dearer than daughter.\\' \\n\\n\\'Lord, lord,\\' began Merry brokenly, \\'she is--\\'; but at that moment \\nthere was a great clamour, and all about them horns and trumpets were \\nblowing. Merry looked round: he had forgotten the war, and all the world \\nbeside, and many hours it seemed since the king rode to his fall, though in \\ntruth it was only a little while. But now he saw that they were in danger of \\nbeing caught in the very midst of the great battle that would soon be \\njoined. \\n\\nNew forces of the enemy were hastening up the road from the River; and \\nfrom under the walls came the legions of Morgul; and from the southward \\nfields came footmen of Harad with horsemen before them, and behind them \\nrose \\n\\nthe huge backs of the mymakil with war -towers upon them. But northward the \\nwhite crest of Jomer led the great front of the Rohirrim which he had again \\ngathered and marshalled; and out of the City came all the strength of men \\nthat was in it, and the silver swan of Dol Amroth was borne in the van, \\ndriving the enemy from the Gate. \\n\\nFor a moment the thought flitted through Merry\\'s mind: \\'Where is \\nGandalf? Is he not here? Could he not have saved the king and Jowyn?\\' But \\nthereupon Jomer rode up in haste, and with him came the knights of the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhousehold that still lived and had now mastered their horses. They looked in \\nwonder at the carcase of the fell beast that lay there: and their steeds \\nwould not go near. But Jomer leaped from the saddle, and grief and dismay \\nfell upon him as he came to the king\\'s side and stood there in silence. \\n\\nThen one of the knights took the king\\'s banner from the hand of Guthlbf \\nthe banner-bearer who lay dead, and he lifted it up. Slowly Thjoden opened \\nhis eyes. Seeing the banner he made a sign that it should be given to Jomer. \\n\\n\\'Hail, King of the Mark!\\' he said. \\'Ride now to victory! Bid Jowyn \\nfarewell!\\' And so he died, and knew not that Jowyn lay near him. And those \\nwho stood by wept, crying: \\'Thjoden King! Thjoden King!\\' \\n\\nBut Jomer said to them: \\n\\nMourn not overmuch! Mighty was the fallen, \\nmeet was his ending. When his mound is raised, \\nwomen then shall weep. War now calls us! \\n\\nYet he himself wept as he spoke. \\'Let his knights remain here,\\' he \\nsaid; \\'and bear his body in honour from the field, lest the battle ride over \\nit! Yea, and all these other of the king\\'s men that lie here.\\' And he looked \\nat the slain, recalling their names. Then suddenly he beheld his sister \\nJowyn as she lay, and he knew her. He stood a moment as a man who is \\npierced \\n\\nin the midst of a cry by an arrow through the heart; and then his face went \\ndeathly white; and a cold fury rose in him, so that all speech failed him \\nfor a while. A fey mood took him. \\n\\n\\'Jowyn, Jowyn!\\' he cried at last: \\'Jowyn, how come you here? What \\nmadness or devilry is this? Death, death, death! Death take us all!\\' \\n\\nThen without taking counsel or waiting for the approach of the men of \\nthe City, he spurred headlong back to the front of the great host, and blew \\na horn, and cried aloud for the onset. Over the field rang his clear voice \\ncalling: \\'Death! Ride, ride to ruin and the world\\'s ending!\\' \\n\\nAnd with that the host began to move. But the Rohirrim sang no more. \\nDeath they cried with one voice loud and terrible, and gathering speed like \\na great tide their battle swept about their fallen king and passed, roaring \\naway southwards. \\n\\nAnd still Meriadoc the hobbit stood there blinking through his tears \\nand no one spoke to him, indeed none seemed to heed him. He brushed away \\nthe \\n\\ntears, and stooped to pick up the green shield that Jowyn had given him; and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhe slung it at his back. Then he looked for his sword that he had let fall; \\nfor even as he struck his blow his arm was numbed, and now he could only use \\nhis left hand. And behold! there lay his weapon, but the blade was smoking \\nlike a dry branch that has been thrust in a fire; and as he watched it, it \\nwrithed and withered and was consumed. \\n\\nSo passed the sword of the Barrow-downs, work of Westernesse. But glad \\nwould he have been to know its fate who wrought it slowly long ago in the \\nNorth-kingdom when the D(r)nedain were young, and chief among their foes \\nwas \\n\\nthe dread realm of Angmar and its sorcerer king. No other blade, not though \\nmightier hands had wielded it, would have dealt that foe a wound so bitter, \\ncleaving the undead flesh, breaking the spell that knit his unseen sinews to \\nhis will. \\n\\nMen now raised the king, and laying cloaks upon spear -truncheons they \\nmade shift to bear him away towards the City; and others lifted Jowyn gently \\nup and bore her after him. But the men of the king\\'s household they could \\nnot yet bring from the field; for seven of the king\\'s knights had fallen \\nthere, and Djorwine their chief was among them. So they laid them apart from \\ntheir foes and the fell beast and set spears about them. And afterwards when \\nall was over men returned and made a fire there and burned the carcase of \\nthe beast; but for Snowmane they dug a grave and set up a stone upon which \\nwas carved in the tongues of Gondor and the Mark: \\n\\nFaithful servant yet master\\'s bane \\n\\nLightfoot\\'s foal, swift Snowmane. \\n\\nGreen and long grew the grass on Snowmane\\'s Howe, but ever black and \\nbare was the ground where the beast was burned. \\n\\nNow slowly and sadly Merry walked beside the bearers, and he gave no \\nmore heed to the battle. He was weary and full of pain, and his limbs \\ntrembled as with a chill. A great rain came out of the Sea, and it seemed \\nthat all things wept for Thjoden and Jowyn, quenching the fires in the City \\nwith grey tears. It was through a mist that presently he saw the van of the \\nmen of Gondor approaching. Imrahil, Prince of Dol Amroth, rode up and \\ndrew \\n\\nrein before them. \\n\\n\\'What burden do you bear, Men of Rohan?\\' he cried. \\n\\n\\'Thjoden King,\\' they answered. \\'He is dead. But Jomer King now rides in \\nthe battle: he with the white crest in the wind.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the prince went from his horse, and knelt by the bier in honour of \\nthe king and his great onset; and he wept. And rising he looked then on \\nJowyn and was amazed. \\'Surely, here is a woman?\\' he said. \\'Have even the \\nwomen of the Rohirrim come to war in our need?\\' \\n\\n\\'Nay! One only,\\' they answered. \\'The Lady Jowyn is she, sister of \\nJomer; and we knew naught of her riding until this hour, and greatly we rue \\nit.\\' \\n\\nThen the prince seeing her beauty, though her face was pale and cold, \\ntouched her hand as he bent to look more closely on her. \\'Men of Rohan!\\' he \\ncried. \\'Are there no leeches among you? She is hurt to the death maybe, but \\nI deem that she yet lives.\\' And he held the bright-burnished vambrace that \\nwas upon his arm before her cold tips, and behold! a little mist was laid on \\nit hardly to be seen. \\n\\n\\'Haste now is needed,\\' he said, and he sent one riding back swiftly to \\nthe City to bring aid. But he bowing low to the fallen, bade them farewell, \\nand mounting rode away into battle. \\n\\nAnd now the fighting waxed furious on the fields of the Pelennor; and \\nthe din of arms rose upon high, with the crying of men and the neighing of \\nhorses. Horns were blown and trumpets were braying, and the mymakil were \\nbellowing as they were goaded to war. Under the south walls of the City the \\nfootmen of Gondor now drove against the legions of Morgul that were still \\ngathered there in strength. But the horsemen rode eastward to the succour of \\nJomer: H(r)rin the Tall Warden of the Keys, and the Lord of Lossarnach, and \\nHirluin of the Green Hills, and Prince Imrahil the fair with his knights all \\nabout him. \\n\\nNot too soon came their aid to the Rohirrim; for fortune had turned \\nagainst Jomer, and his fury had betrayed him. The great wrath of his onset \\nhad utterly overthrown the front of his enemies, and great wedges of his \\nRiders had passed clear through the ranks of the Southrons, discomfiting \\ntheir horsemen and riding their footmen to ruin. But wherever the mymakil \\ncame there the horses would not go, but blenched and swerved away; and the \\ngreat monsters were unfought, and stood like towers of defence, and the \\nHaradrim rallied about them. And if the Rohirrim at their onset were thrice \\noutnumbered by the Haradrim alone, soon their case became worse; for new \\nstrength came now streaming to the field out of Osgiliath. There they had \\nbeen mustered for the sack of the City and the rape of Gondor, waiting on \\nthe call of their Captain. He now was destroyed; but Gothmog the lieutenant \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nof Morgul had flung them into the fray; Easterlings with axes, and Variags \\nof Khand. Southrons in scarlet, and out of Far Harad black men like \\nhalf-trolls with white eyes and red tongues. Some now hastened up behind the \\nRohirrim, others held westward to hold off the forces of Gondor and prevent \\ntheir joining with Rohan. \\n\\nIt was even as the day thus began to turn against Gondor and their hope \\nwavered that a new cry went up in the City, it being then midmorning, and a \\ngreat wind blowing, and the rain flying north, and the sun shining. In that \\nclear air watchmen on the walls saw afar a new sight of fear, and their last \\nhope left them. \\n\\nFor Anduin, from the bend at the Harlond, so flowed that from the City \\nmen could look down it lengthwise for some leagues, and the far-sighted \\ncould see any ships that approached. And looking thither they cried in \\ndismay; for black against the glittering stream they beheld a fleet borne up \\non the wind: dromunds, and ships of great draught with many oars, and with \\nblack sails bellying in the breeze. \\n\\nThe Corsairs of Umbar!\\' men shouted. \\'The Corsairs of Umbar! Took! The \\nCorsairs of Umbar are coming! So Belfalas is taken, and the Ethir, and \\nFebennin is gone. The Corsairs are upon us! It is the last stroke of doom!\\' \\n\\nAnd some without order, for none could he found to command them in the \\nCity, ran to the bells and tolled the alarm; and some blew the trumpets \\nsounding the retreat. \\'Back to the walls!\\' they cried. \\'Back to the walls! \\n\\nCome back to the City before all are overwhelmed!\\' But the wind that sped \\nthe ships blew all their clamour away. \\n\\nThe Rohirrim indeed had no need of news or alarm. All too well they \\ncould see for themselves the black sails. For Jomer was now scarcely a mile \\nfrom the Harlond, and a great press of his first foes was between him and \\nthe haven there, while new foes came swirling behind, cutting him off from \\nthe Prince. Now he looked to the River, and hope died in his heart, and the \\nwind that he had blessed he now called accursed. But the hosts of Mordor \\nwere enheartened, and filled with a new lust and fury they came yelling to \\nthe onset. \\n\\nStern now was Jomer\\'s mood, and his mind clear again. He let blow the \\nhorns to rally all men to his banner that could come thither; for he thought \\nto make a great shield-wall at the last, and stand, and fight there on foot \\ntill all fell, and do deeds of song on the fields of Pelennor, though no man \\nshould be left in the West to remember the last King of the Mark. So he rode \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nto a green hillock and there set his banner, and the White Horse ran \\nrippling in the wind. \\n\\nOut of doubt, out of dark to the day\\'s rising \\n\\nI came singing in the sun, sword unsheathing. \\n\\nTo hope\\'s end I rode and to heart\\'s breaking: \\n\\nNow for wrath, now for ruin and a red nightfall! \\n\\nThese staves he spoke, yet he laughed as he said them. For once more \\nlust of battle was on him; and he was still unscathed, and he was young, and \\nhe was king: the lord of a fell people. And lo! even as he laughed at \\ndespair he looked out again on the black ships, and he lifted up his sword \\nto defy them. \\n\\nAnd then wonder took him, and a great joy; and he cast his sword up in \\nthe sunlight and sang as he caught it. And all eyes followed his gaze, and \\nbehold! upon the foremost ship a great standard broke, and the wind \\ndisplayed it as she turned towards the Harlond. There flowered a White Tree, \\nand that was for Gondor; but Seven Stars were about it, and a high crown \\nabove it, the signs of Elendil that no lord had borne for years beyond \\ncount. And the stars flamed in the sunlight, for they were wrought of gems \\nby Arwen daughter of Elrond; and the crown was bright in the morning, for it \\nwas wrought of mithril and gold. \\n\\nThus came Aragorn son of Arathorn, Elessar, Isildur\\'s heir, out of the \\nPaths of the Dead, borne upon a wind from the Sea to the kingdom of Gondor; \\nand the mirth of the Rohirrim was a torrent of laughter and a flashing of \\nswords, and the joy and wonder of the City was a music of trumpets and a \\nringing of bells. But the hosts of Mordor were seized with bewilderment, and \\na great wizardry it seemed to them that their own ships should be filled \\nwith their foes; and a black dread fell on them, knowing that the tides of \\nfate had turned against them and their doom was at hand. \\n\\nEast rode the knights of Dol Amroth driving the enemy before them: \\ntroll-men and Variags and ores that hated the sunlight. South strode Jomer \\nand men fled before his face, and they were caught between the hammer and \\nthe anvil. For now men leaped from the ships to the quays of the Harlond and \\nswept north like a storm. There came Legolas, and Gimli wielding his axe, \\nand Halbarad with the standard, and Elladan and Elrohir with stars on their \\nbrow, and the dour-handed D(r)nedain, Rangers of the North, leading a great \\nvalour of the folk of Lebennin and Lamedon and the fiefs of the South. But \\nbefore all went Aragorn with the Flame of the West, And(r)ril like a new fire \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nkindled, Narsil re-forged as deadly as of old: and upon his brow was the \\nStar of Elendil. \\n\\nAnd so at length Jomer and Aragorn met in the midst of the battle, and \\nthey leaned on their swords and looked on one another and were glad. \\n\\n\\'Thus we meet again, though all the hosts of Mordor lay between us,\\' \\nsaid Aragorn. \\'Did I not say so at the Hornburg?\\' \\n\\n\\'So you spoke,\\' said Jomer, \\'but hope oft deceives, and I knew not then \\nthat you were a man foresighted. Yet twice blessed is help unlooked for, and \\nnever was a meeting of friends more joyful.\\' And they clasped hand in hand. \\n\\'Nor indeed more timely,\\' said Jomer. \\'You come none too soon, my friend. \\nMuch loss and sorrow has befallen us.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then let us avenge it, ere we speak of it!\\' said Aragorn, and they \\nrode back to battle together. \\n\\nHard fighting and long labour they had still; for the Southrons were \\nbold men and grim, and fierce in despair; and the Easterlings were strong \\nand war-hardened and asked for no quarter. And so in this place and that, by \\nburned homestead or barn, upon hillock or mound, under wall or on field, \\nstill they gathered and rallied and fought until the day wore away. \\n\\nThen the Sun went at last behind Mindolluin and filled all the sky with \\na great burning, so that the hills and the mountains were dyed as with \\nblood; fire glowed in the River, and the grass of the Pelennor lay red in \\nthe nightfall. And in that hour the great Battle of the field of Gondor was \\nover; and not one living foe was left within the circuit of the Rammas. All \\nwere slain save those who fled to die, or to drown in the red foam of the \\nRiver. Few ever came eastward to Morgul or Mordor; and to the land of the \\nHaradrim came only a tale from far off: a rumour of the wrath and terror of \\nGondor. \\n\\nAragorn and Jomer and Imrahil rode back towards the Gate of the City, \\nand they were now weary beyond joy or sorrow. These three were unscathed, \\nfor such was their fortune and the skill and might of their arms, and few \\nindeed had dared to abide them or look on their faces in the hour of their \\nwrath. But many others were hurt or maimed or dead upon the field. The axes \\nhewed Forlong as he fought alone and unhorsed; and both Duilin of Morthond \\nand his brother were trampled to death when they assailed the mymakil, \\nleading their bowmen close to shoot at the eyes of the monsters. Neither \\nHirluin the fair would return to Pinnath Gelin, nor Grimbold to Grimslade, \\nnor Halbarad to the Northlands, dour -handed Ranger. No few had fallen, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nrenowned or nameless, captain or soldier; for it was a great battle and the \\nfull count of it no tale has told. So long afterward a maker in Rohan said \\nin his song of the Mounds of Mundburg: \\n\\nWe heard of the horns in the hills ringing, \\nthe swords shining in the South-kingdom. \\n\\nSteeds went striding to the Stoningland \\nas wind in the morning. War was kindled. \\n\\nThere Thjoden fell, Thengling mighty, \\nto his golden halls and green pastures \\nin the Northern fields never returning, \\nhigh lord of the host. Harding and Guthlbf \\nD(r)nhere and Djorwine, doughty Grimbold, \\n\\nHerefara and Herubrand, Horn and Fastred, \\nfought and fell there in a far country: \\nin the Mounds of Mundburg under mould they lie \\nwith their league-fellows, lords of Gondor. \\n\\nNeither Hirluin the Fair to the hills by the sea, \\nnor Forlong the old to the flowering vales \\never, to Arnach, to his own country \\nreturned in triumph; nor the tall bowmen, \\n\\nDerufin and Duilin, to their dark waters, \\nmeres ofMorthond under mountain-shadows. \\n\\nDeath in the morning and at day\\'s ending \\nlords took and lowly. Long now they sleep \\nunder grass in Gondor by the Great River. \\n\\nGrey now as tears, gleaming silver, \\nred then it rolled, roaring water: \\nfoam dyed with blood flamed at sunset; \\nas beacons mountains burned at evening; \\nred fell the dew in Rammas Echor. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 7 . The Pyre of Denethor \\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the dark shadow at the Gate withdrew Gandalf still sat motionless. \\nBut Pippin rose to his feet, as if a great weight had been lifted from him; \\nand he stood listening to the horns, and it seemed to him that they would \\nbreak his heart with joy. And never in after years could he hear a horn \\nblown in the distance without tears starting in his eyes. But now suddenly \\nhis errand returned to his memory, and he ran forward. At that moment \\nGandalf stirred and spoke to Shadowfax, and was about to ride through the \\nGate. \\n\\n\\'Gandalf, Gandalf! \\' cried Pippin, and Shadowfax halted. \\n\\n\\'What are you doing here?\\' said Gandalf. \\'Is it not a law in the City \\nthat those who wear the black and silver must stay in the Citadel, unless \\ntheir lord gives them leave?\\' \\n\\n\\'He has,\\' said Pippin. \\'He sent me away. But I am frightened. Something \\nterrible may happen up there. The Lord is out of his mind, I think. I am \\nafraid he will kill himself, and kill Faramir too. Can\\'t you do something?\\' \\n\\nGandalf looked through the gaping Gate, and already on the fields he \\nheard the gathering sound of battle. He clenched his hand. \\'I must go \\' he \\nsaid. \\'The Black Rider is abroad, and he will yet bring ruin on us. I have \\nno time.\\' \\n\\n\\'But Faramir!\\' cried Pippin. \\'He is not dead, and they will burn him \\nalive, if someone does not stop them.\\' \\n\\n\\'Burn him alive?\\' said Gandalf. \\'What is this tale? Be quick!\\' \\n\\n\\'Denethor has gone to the Tombs,\\' said Pippin, \\'and he has taken \\nFaramir, and he says we are all to burn, and he will not wait, and they are \\nto make a pyre and burn him on it, and Faramir as well. And he has sent men \\nto fetch wood and oil. And I have told Beregond, but I\\'m afraid he won\\'t \\ndare to leave his post: he is on guard. And what can he do anyway?\\' So \\nPippin poured out his tale, reaching up and touching Gandalf s knee with \\ntrembling hands. \\'Can\\'t you save Faramir?\\' \\n\\n\\'Maybe I can,\\' said Gandalf; \\'but if I do, then others will die, I \\nfear. Well, I must come, since no other help can reach him. But evil and \\nsorrow will come of this. Even in the heart of our stronghold the Enemy has \\npower to strike us: for his will it is that is at work.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThen having made up his mind he acted swiftly; and catching up Pippin \\nand setting him before him, he turned Shadowfax with a word. Up the climbing \\nstreets of Minas Tirith they clattered, while the noise of war rose behind \\nthem. Everywhere men were rising from their despair and dread, seizing their \\nweapons, crying one to another: \\'Rohan has come!\\' Captains were shouting, \\ncompanies were mustering; many already were marching down to the Gate. \\n\\nThey met the Prince Imrahil, and he called to them: \\'Whither now, \\nMithrandir? The Rohirrim are fighting on the fields of Gondor! We must \\ngather all the strength that we can find.\\' \\n\\n\\'You will need every man and more,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Make all haste. I \\nwill come when I can. But I have an errand to the Lord Denethor that will \\nnot wait. Take command in the Lord\\'s absence!\\' \\n\\nThey passed on; and as they climbed and drew near to the Citadel they \\nfelt the wind blowing in their faces, and they caught the glimmer of morning \\nfar away, a light growing in the southern sky. But it brought little hope to \\nthem, not knowing what evil lay before them, fearing to come too late. \\n\\n\\'Darkness is passing,\\' said Gandalf, \\'but it still lies heavy on this \\nCity.\\' \\n\\nAt the gate of the Citadel they found no guard. \\'Then Beregond has \\ngone,\\' said Pippin more hopefully. They turned away and hastened along the \\nroad to the Closed Door. It stood wide open, and the porter lay before it. \\n\\nHe was slain and his key had been taken. \\n\\n\\'Work of the Enemy!\\' said Gandalf. \\'Such deeds he loves: friend at war \\nwith friend; loyalty divided in confusion of hearts.\\' Now he dismounted and \\nbade Shadowfax return to his stable. \\'Lor, my friend,\\' he said, \\'you and I \\nshould have ridden to the fields long ago, but other matters delay me. Yet \\ncome swiftly if I call!\\' \\n\\nThey passed the Door and walked on down the steep winding road. Light \\nwas growing, and the tall columns and carven figures beside the way went \\nslowly by like grey ghosts. \\n\\nSuddenly the silence was broken, and they heard below them cries and \\nthe ringing of swords: such sounds as had not been heard in the hallowed \\nplaces since the building of the City. At last they came to Rath Dnnen and \\nhastened towards the House of the Stewards, looming in the twilight under \\nits great dome. \\n\\n\\'Stay! Stay!\\' cried Gandalf, springing forward to the stone stair \\nbefore the door. \\'Stay this madness!\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor there were the servants of Denethor with swords and torches in \\ntheir hands; but alone in the porch upon the topmost step stood Beregond, \\nclad in the black and silver of the Guard; and he held the door against \\nthem. Two of them had already fallen to his sword, staining the hallows with \\ntheir blood; and the others cursed him, calling him outlaw and traitor to \\nhis master. \\n\\nEven as Gandalf and Pippin ran forward, they heard from within the \\nhouse of the dead the voice of Denethor crying: \\'Haste, haste! Do as I have \\nbidden! Slay me this renegade! Or must I do so myself?\\' Thereupon the door \\nwhich Beregond held shut with his left hand was wrenched open, and there \\nbehind him stood the Lord of the City, tall and fell; a light like flame was \\nin his eyes, and he held a drawn sword. \\n\\nBut Gandalf sprang up the steps, and the men fell back from him and \\ncovered their eyes; for his coming was like the incoming of a white light \\ninto a dark place, and he came with great anger. He lifted up his hand, and \\nin the very stroke, the sword of Denethor flew up and left his grasp and \\nfell behind him in the shadows of the house; and Denethor stepped backward \\nbefore Gandalf as one amazed. \\n\\n\\'What is this, my lord?\\' said the wizard. \\'The houses of the dead are \\nno places for the living. And why do men fight here in the Hallows when \\nthere is war enough before the Gate? Or has our Enemy come even to Rath \\nDnnen?\\' \\n\\n\\'Since when has the Lord of Gondor been answerable to thee?\\' said \\nDenethor. \\'Or may I not command my own servants?\\' \\n\\n\\'You may,\\' said Gandalf. \\'But others may contest your will, when it is \\nturned to madness and evil. Where is your son, Faramir?\\' \\n\\n\\'He lies within,\\' said Denethor, \\'burning, already burning. They have \\nset a fire in his flesh. But soon all shall be burned. The West has failed. \\n\\nIt shall all go up in a great fire, and all shall be ended. Ash! Ash and \\nsmoke blown away on the wind!\\' \\n\\nThen Gandalf seeing the madness that was on him feared that he had \\nalready done some evil deed, and he thrust forward, with Beregond and Pippin \\nbehind him, while Denethor gave back until he stood beside the table within. \\nBut there they found Faramir, still dreaming in his fever, lying upon the \\ntable. Wood was piled under it, and high all about it, and all was drenched \\nwith oil, even the garments of Faramir and the coverlets; but as yet no fire \\nhad been set to the fuel. Then Gandalf revealed the strength that lay hid in \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhim; even as the light of his power was hidden under his grey mantle. He \\nleaped up on to the faggots, and raising the sick man lightly he sprang down \\nagain, and bore him towards the door. But as he did so Faramir moaned and \\ncalled on his father in his dream. \\n\\nDenethor started as one waking from a trance, and the flame died in his \\neyes, and he wept; and he said: \\'Do not take my son from me! He calls for \\nme.\\' \\n\\n\\'He calls,\\' said Gandalf, \\'but you cannot come to him yet. For he must \\nseek healing on the threshold of death, and maybe find it not. Whereas your \\npart is to go out to the battle of your City, where maybe death awaits you. \\n\\nThis you know in your heart.\\' \\n\\n\\'He will not wake again,\\' said Denethor. \\'Battle is vain. Why should we \\nwish to live longer? Why should we not go to death side by side?\\' \\n\\n\\'Authority is not given to you, Steward of Gondor, to order the hour of \\nyour death,\\' answered Gandalf. \\'And only the heathen kings, under the \\ndomination of the Dark Power, did thus, slaying themselves in pride and \\ndespair, murdering their kin to ease their own death.\\' Then passing through \\nthe door he took Faramir from the deadly house and laid him on the bier on \\nwhich he had been brought, and which had now been set in the porch. Denethor \\nfollowed him, and stood trembling, looking with longing on the face of his \\nson. And for a moment, while all were silent and still, watching the Lord in \\nhis throes, he wavered. \\n\\n\\'Come!\\' said Gandalf. \\'We are needed. There is much that you can yet \\ndo.\\' \\n\\nThen suddenly Denethor laughed. He stood up tall and proud again, and \\nstepping swiftly back to the table he lifted from it the pillow on which his \\nhead had lain. Then coming to the doorway he drew aside the covering, and \\nlo! he had between his hands a palantnr. And as he held it up, it seemed to \\nthose that looked on that the globe began to glow with an inner flame, so \\nthat the lean face of the Lord was lit as with a red fire, and it seemed cut \\nout of hard stone, sharp with black shadows, noble, proud, and terrible. His \\neyes glittered. \\n\\n\\'Pride and despair!\\' he cried. \\'Didst thou think that the eyes of the \\nWhite Tower were blind? Nay, I have seen more than thou knowest, Grey \\nFool. \\n\\nFor thy hope is but ignorance. Go then and labour in healing! Go forth and \\nfight! Vanity. For a little space you may triumph on the field, for a day. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut against the Power that now arises there is no victory. To this City only \\nthe first finger of its hand has yet been stretched. All the East is moving. \\n\\nAnd even now the wind of thy hope cheats thee and wafts up Anduin a fleet \\nwith black sails. The West has failed. It is time for all to depart who \\nwould not be slaves.\\' \\n\\n\\'Such counsels will make the Enemy\\'s victory certain indeed,\\' said \\nGandalf. \\n\\n\\'Hope on then!\\' laughed Denethor. \\'Do I not know thee, Mithrandir? Thy \\nhope is to rule in my stead, to stand behind every throne, north, south, or \\nwest. I have read thy mind and its policies. Do I not know that you \\ncommanded this halfling here to keep silence? That you brought him hither to \\nbe a spy within my very chamber? And yet in our speech together I have \\nlearned the names and purpose of all thy companions. So! With the left hand \\nthou wouldst use me for a little while as a shield against Mordor, and with \\nthe right bring up this Ranger of the North to supplant me. \\n\\n\\'But I say to thee, Gandalf Mithrandir, I will not be thy tool! I am \\nSteward of the House of Anbrion. I will not step down to be the dotard \\nchamberlain of an upstart. Even were his claim proved to me, still he comes \\nbut of the line of Isildur. I will not bow to such a one, last of a ragged \\nhouse long bereft of lordship and dignity.\\' \\n\\n\\'What then would you have,\\' said Gandalf, \\'if your will could have its \\nway?\\' \\n\\n\\'I would have things as they were in all the days of my life,\\' answered \\nDenethor, \\'and in the days of my longfathers before me: to be the Lord of \\nthis City in peace, and leave my chair to a son after me, who would be his \\nown master and no wizard\\'s pupil. But if doom denies this to me, then I will \\nhave naught, neither life diminished, nor love halved, nor honour abated.\\' \\n\\n\\'To me it would not seem that a Steward who faithfully surrenders his \\ncharge is diminished in love or in honour,\\' said Gandalf. \\'And at the least \\nyou shall not rob your son of his choice while his death is still in doubt.\\' \\n\\nAt those words Denethor\\'s eyes flamed again, and taking the Stone under \\nhis arm he drew a knife and strode towards the bier. But Beregond sprang \\nforward and set himself before Faramir. \\n\\n\\'So!\\' cried Denethor. \\'Thou hadst already stolen half my son\\'s love. \\n\\nNow thou stealest the hearts of my knights also, so that they rob me wholly \\nof my son at the last. But in this at least thou shalt not defy my will: to \\nrule my own end.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Come hither!\\' he cried to his servants. \\'Come, if you are not all \\nrecreant!\\' Then two of them ran up the steps to him. Swiftly he snatched a \\ntorch from the hand of one and sprang back into the house. Before Gandalf \\ncould hinder him he thrust the brand amid the fuel, and at once it crackled \\nand roared into flame. \\n\\nThen Denethor leaped upon the table, and standing there wreathed in \\nfire and smoke he took up the staff of his stewardship that lay at his feet \\nand broke it on his knee. Casting the pieces into the blaze he bowed and \\nlaid himself on the table, clasping the palantnr with both hands upon his \\nbreast. And it was said that ever after, if any man looked in that Stone, \\nunless he had a great strength of will to turn it to other purpose, he saw \\nonly two aged hands withering in flame. \\n\\nGandalf in grief and horror turned his face away and closed the door. \\n\\nFor a while he stood in thought, silent upon the threshold, while those \\noutside heard the greedy roaring of the fire within. And then Denethor gave \\na great cry, and afterwards spoke no more, nor was ever again seen by mortal \\nmen. \\n\\n\\'So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion,\\' said Gandalf: Then he turned to \\nBeregond and the Lord\\'s servants that stood there aghast. \\'And so pass also \\nthe days of Gondor that you have known; for good or evil they are ended. Ill \\ndeeds have been done here; but let now all enmity that lies between you be \\nput away, for it was contrived by the Enemy and works his will. You have \\nbeen caught in a net of warring duties that you did not weave. But think, \\nyou servants of the Lord, blind in your obedience, that but for the treason \\nof Beregond Faramir, Captain of the White Tower, would now also be burned. \\n\\n\\'Bear away from this unhappy place your comrades who have fallen. And \\nwe will bear Faramir, Steward of Gondor, to a place where he can sleep in \\npeace, or die if that be his doom.\\' \\n\\nThen Gandalf and Beregond taking up the bier bore it away towards the \\nHouses of Healing, while behind them walked Pippin with downcast head. \\nBut \\n\\nthe servants of the Lord stood gazing as stricken men at the house of the \\ndead; and even as Gandalf came to the end of Rath Dnnen there was a great \\nnoise. Looking back they saw the dome of the house crack and smokes issue \\nforth; and then with a rush and rumble of stone it fell in a flurry of fire; \\nbut still unabated the flames danced and flickered among the ruins. Then in \\nterror the servants fled and followed Gandalf. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt length they came back to the Steward\\'s Door, and Beregond looked \\nwith grief at the porter. This deed I shall ever rue,\\' he said; \\'but a \\nmadness of haste was on me, and he would not listen, but drew sword against \\nme.\\' Then taking the key that he had wrested from the slain man he closed \\nthe door and locked it. This should now be given to the Lord Faramir,\\' he \\nsaid. \\n\\nThe Prince of Dol Amroth is in command in the absence of the Lord,\\' \\nsaid Gandalf; \\'but since he is not here, I must take this on myself. I bid \\nyou keep the key and guard it, until the City is set in order again.\\' \\n\\nNow at last they passed into the high circles of the City, and in the \\nlight of morning they went their way towards the Houses of Healing; and \\nthese were fair houses set apart, for the care of those who were grievously \\nsick, but now they were prepared for the tending of men hurt in battle or \\ndying. They stood not far from the Citadel-gate, in the sixth circle, nigh \\nto its southward wall, and about them was a garden and a greensward with \\ntrees, the only such place in the City. There dwelt the few women that had \\nbeen permitted to remain in Minas Tirith, since they were skilled in healing \\nor in the service of the healers. \\n\\nBut even as Gandalf and his companions came carrying the bier to the \\nmain door of the Houses, they heard a great cry that went up from the field \\nbefore the Gate and rising shrill and piercing into the sky passed, and died \\naway on the wind. So terrible was the cry that for a moment all stood still, \\nand yet when it had passed, suddenly their hearts were lifted up in such a \\nhope as they had not known since the darkness came out of the East; and it \\nseemed to them that the light grew clear and the sun broke through the \\nclouds. \\n\\nBut Gandalf s face was grave and sad, and bidding Beregond and Pippin \\nto take Faramir into the Houses of Healing, he went up on to the walls \\nnearby; and there like a figure carven in white he stood in the new sun and \\nlooked out. And he beheld with the sight that was given to him all that had \\nbefallen; and when Jomer rode out from the forefront of his battle and stood \\nbeside those who lay upon the field, he sighed, and he cast his cloak about \\nhim again, and went from the walls. And Beregond and Pippin found him \\nstanding in thought before the door of the Houses when they came out. \\n\\nThey looked at him, and for a while he was silent. At last he spoke. \\n\\n\\'My friends,\\' he said, \\'and all you people of this city and of the Western \\nlands! Things of great sorrow and renown have come to pass. Shall we weep or \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbe glad? Beyond hope the Captain of our foes has been destroyed, and you \\nhave heard the echo of his last despair. But he has not gone without woe and \\nbitter loss. And that I might have averted but for the madness of Denethor. \\n\\nSo long has the reach of our Enemy become! Alas! but now I perceive how his \\nwill was able to enter into the very heart of the City. \\n\\n\\'Though the Stewards deemed that it was a secret kept only by \\nthemselves, long ago I guessed that here in the White Tower, one at least of \\nthe Seven Seeing Stones was preserved. In the days of his wisdom Denethor \\ndid not presume to use it, nor to challenge Sauron, knowing the limits of \\nhis own strength. But his wisdom failed; and I fear that as the peril of his \\nrealm grew he looked in the Stone and was deceived: far too often, I guess, \\nsince Boromir departed. He was too great to be subdued to the will of the \\nDark Power, he saw nonetheless only those things which that Power permitted \\nhim to see. The knowledge which he obtained was, doubtless, often of service \\nto him; yet the vision of the great might of Mordor that was shown to him \\nfed the despair of his heart until it overthrew his mind.\\' \\n\\n\\'Now I understand what seemed so strange to me!\\' said Pippin shuddering \\nat his memories as he spoke. \\'The Lord went away from the room where \\nFar amir \\n\\nlay; and it was only when he returned that I first thought he was changed, \\nold and broken.\\' \\n\\n\\'It was in the very hour that Faramir was brought to the Tower that \\nmany of us saw a strange light in the topmost chamber,\\' said Beregond. \\'But \\nwe have seen that light before, and it has long been rumoured in the City, \\nthat the Lord would at times wrestle in thought with his Enemy.\\' \\n\\n\\'Alas! then I have guessed rightly,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Thus the will of \\nSauron entered into Minas Tirith; and thus I have been delayed here. And \\nhere I shall still be forced to remain, for I shall soon have other charges, \\nnot Faramir only. \\n\\n\\'Now I must go down to meet those who come. I have seen a sight upon \\nthe field that is very grievous to my heart, and greater sorrow may yet come \\nto pass. Come with me, Pippin! But you, Beregond, should return to the \\nCitadel and tell the chief of the Guard there what has befallen. It will be \\nhis duty, I fear, to withdraw you from the Guard; but say to him that, if I \\nmay give him counsel, you should be sent to the Houses of Healing, to be the \\nguard and servant of your captain, and to be at his side when he awakes - if \\nthat shall ever be again. For by you he was saved from the fire. Go now ! I \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nshall return soon.\\' \\n\\nWith that he turned away and went with Pippin down towards the lower \\ncity. And even as they hastened on their way the wind brought a grey rain, \\nand all the fires sank, and there arose a great smoke before them. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 8 . The Houses of Healing \\n\\n\\n\\nA mist was in Merry\\'s eyes of tears and weariness when they drew near \\nthe ruined Gate of Minas Tirith. He gave little heed to the wreck and \\nslaughter that lay about all. Fire and smoke and stench was in the air; for \\nmany engines had been burned or cast into the fire-pits, and many of the \\nslain also, while here and there lay many carcases of the great Southron \\nmonsters, half-burned, or broken by stone-cast, or shot through the eyes by \\nthe valiant archers of Morthond. The flying rain had ceased for a time, and \\nthe sun gleamed up above; but all the lower city was still wrapped in a \\nsmouldering reek. \\n\\nAlready men were labouring to clear a way through the jetsam of battle; \\nand now out from the Gate came some bearing litters. Gently they laid Jowyn \\nupon soft pillows; but the king\\'s body they covered with a great cloth of \\ngold, and they bore torches about him, and their flames, pale in the \\nsunlight, were fluttered by the wind. \\n\\nSo Thjoden and Jowyn came to the City of Gondor, and all who saw them \\nbared their heads and bowed; and they passed through the ash and fume of the \\nburned circle, and went on and up along the streets of stone. To Merry the \\nascent seemed agelong, a meaningless journey in a hateful dream, going on \\nand on to some dim ending that memory cannot seize. \\n\\nSlowly the lights of the torches in front of him flickered and went \\nout, and he was walking in a darkness; and he thought: \\'This is a tunnel \\nleading to a tomb; there we shall stay forever.\\' But suddenly into his dream \\nthere fell a living voice. \\n\\n\\'Well, Merry! Thank goodness I have found you!\\' \\n\\nHe looked up and the mist before his eyes cleared a little. There was \\nPippin! They were face to face in a narrow lane, and but for themselves it \\nwas empty. He rubbed his eyes. \\n\\n\\'Where is the king?\\' he said. \\'And Jowyn?\\' Then he stumbled and sat \\ndown on a doorstep and began to weep again. \\n\\n\\'They have gone up into the Citadel,\\' said Pippin. \\'I think you must \\nhave fallen asleep on your feet and taken the wrong turning. When we found \\nthat you were not with them, Gandalf sent me to look for you. Poor old \\nMerry! How glad I am to see you again! But you are worn out, and I won\\'t \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbother you with any talk. But tell me, are you hurt, or wounded?\\' \\n\\n\\'No,\\' said Merry. \\'Well, no, I don\\'t think so. But I can\\'t use my right \\narm, Pippin, not since I stabbed him. And my sword burned all away like a \\npiece of wood.\\' \\n\\nPippin\\'s face was anxious. \\'Well, you had better come with me as quick \\nas you can,\\' he said. \\'I wish I could carry you. You aren\\'t fit to walk any \\nfurther. They shouldn\\'t have let you walk at all; but you must forgive them. \\n\\nSo many dreadful things have happened in the City, Merry, that one poor \\nhobbit coming in from the battle is easily overlooked.\\' \\n\\n\\'It\\'s not always a misfortune being overlooked,\\' said Merry. \\'I was \\noverlooked just now by - no, no, I can\\'t speak of it. Help me, Pippin! It\\'s \\nall going dark again, and my arm is so cold.\\' \\n\\n\\'Lean on me, Merry lad!\\' said Pippin. \\'Come now! Foot by foot. It\\'s not \\nfar.\\' \\n\\n\\'Are you going to bury me?\\' said Merry. \\n\\n\\'No, indeed!\\' said Pippin, trying to sound cheerful, though his heart \\nwas wrung with fear and pity. \\'No, we are going to the Houses of Healing.\\' \\n\\nThey turned out of the lane that ran between tall houses and the outer \\nwall of the fourth circle, and they regained the main street climbing up to \\nthe Citadel. Step by step they went, while Merry swayed and murmured as one \\nin sleep. \\n\\n\\'I\\'ll never get him there,\\' thought Pippin. \\'Is there no one to help \\nme? I can\\'t leave him here.\\' Just then to his surprise a boy came running up \\nbehind, and as he passed he recognized Bergil Beregond\\'s son. \\n\\n\\'Hullo, Bergil!\\' he called. \\'Where are you going? Glad to see you \\nagain, and still alive!\\' \\n\\n\\'I am running errands for the Healers,\\' said Bergil. \\'I cannot stay.\\' \\n\\n\\'Don\\'t!\\' said Pippin. \\'But tell them up there that I have a sick \\nhobbit, a perian mind you, come from the battle-field. I don\\'t think he can \\nwalk so far. If Mithrandir is there, he will be glad of the message.\\' Bergil \\nran on. \\n\\n\\'I\\'d better wait here,\\' thought Pippin. So he let Merry sink gently \\ndown on to the pavement in a patch of sunlight, and then he sat down beside \\nhim, laying Merry\\'s head in his lap. He felt his body and limbs gently, and \\ntook his friend\\'s hands in his own. The right hand felt icy to the touch. \\n\\nIt was not long before Gandalf himself came in search of them. He \\nstooped over Merry and caressed his brow; then he lifted him carefully. \\'He \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nshould have been borne in honour into this city,\\' he said. \\'He has well \\nrepaid my trust; for if Elrond had not yielded to me, neither of you would \\nhave set out; and then far more grievous would the evils of this day have \\nbeen.\\' He sighed. \\'And yet here is another charge on my hands, while all the \\ntime the battle hangs in the balance.\\' \\n\\nSo at last Faramir and Jowyn and Meriadoc were laid in beds in the \\nHouses of Healing; and there they were tended well. For though all lore was \\nin these latter days fallen from its fullness of old, the leechcraft of \\nGondor was still wise, and skilled in the healing of wound and hurt, and all \\nsuch sickness as east of the Sea mortal men were subject to. Save old age \\nonly. For that they had found no cure; and indeed the span of their lives \\nhad now waned to little more than that of other men, and those among them \\nwho passed the tale of five score years with vigour were grown few, save in \\nsome houses of purer blood. But now their art and knowledge were baffled; \\nfor there were many sick of a malady that would not be healed; and they \\ncalled it the Black Shadow, for it came from the Nazgyl. And those who were \\nstricken with it fell slowly into an ever deeper dream, and then passed to \\nsilence and a deadly cold, and so died. And it seemed to the tenders of the \\nsick that on the Halfling and on the Fady of Rohan this malady lay heavily. \\nStill at whiles as the morning wore away they would speak, murmuring in \\ntheir dreams; and the watchers listened to all that they said, hoping \\nperhaps to learn something that would help them to understand their hurts. \\nBut soon they began to fall down into the darkness, and as the sun turned \\nwest a grey shadow crept over their faces. But Faramir burned with a fever \\nthat would not abate. \\n\\nGandalf went from one to the other full of care, and he was told all \\nthat the watchers could hear. And so the day passed, while the great battle \\noutside went on with shifting hopes and strange tidings; and still Gandalf \\nwaited and watched and did not go forth; till at last the red sunset filled \\nall the sky, and the light through the windows fell on the grey faces of the \\nsick. Then it seemed to those who stood by that in the glow the faces \\nflushed softly as with health returning, but it was only a mockery of hope. \\n\\nThen an old wife, Ioreth, the eldest of the women who served in that \\nhouse, looking on the fair face of Faramir, wept, for all the people loved \\nhim. And she said: \\'Alas! if he should die. Would that there were kings in \\nGondor, as there were once upon a time, they say! For it is said in old \\nlore: The hands of the king are the hands of a healer. And so the rightful \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nking could ever be known.\\' \\n\\nAnd Gandalf, who stood by, said: \\'Men may long remember your words, \\nIoreth! For there is hope in them. Maybe a king has indeed returned to \\nGondor; or have you not heard the strange tidings that have come to the \\nCity?\\' \\n\\n\\'I have been too busy with this and that to heed all the crying and \\nshouting,\\' she answered. \\'All I hope is that those murdering devils do not \\ncome to this House and trouble the sick.\\' \\n\\nThen Gandalf went out in haste, and already the fire in the sky was \\nburning out, and the smouldering hills were fading, while ash-grey evening \\ncrept over the fields. \\n\\nNow as the sun went down Aragorn and Jomer and Imrahil drew near the \\nCity with their captains and knights; and when they came before the Gate \\nAragorn said: \\n\\n\\'Behold the Sun setting in a great fire! It is a sign of the end and \\nfall of many things, and a change in the tides of the world. But this City \\nand realm has rested in the charge of the Stewards for many long years, and \\nI fear that if I enter it unbidden, then doubt and debate may arise, which \\nshould not be while this war is fought. I will not enter in, nor make any \\nclaim, until it be seen whether we or Mordor shall prevail. Men shall pitch \\nmy tents upon the field, and here I will await the welcome of the Lord of \\nthe City.\\' \\n\\nBut Jomer said: \\'Already you have raised the banner of the Kings and \\ndisplayed the tokens of Elendil\\'s House. Will you suffer these to be \\nchallenged?\\' \\n\\n\\'No,\\' said Aragorn. \\'But I deem the time unripe; and I have no mind for \\nstrife except with our Enemy and his servants.\\' \\n\\nAnd the Prince Imrahil said. Your words, lord, are wise, if one who is \\na kinsman of the Lord Denethor may counsel you in this matter. He is \\nstrong-willed and proud, but old; and his mood has been strange since his \\nson was stricken down. Yet I would not have you remain like a beggar at the \\ndoor.\\' \\n\\n\\'Not a beggar,\\' said Aragorn. \\'Say a captain of the Rangers, who are \\nunused to cities and houses of stone.\\' And he commanded that his banner \\nshould be furled; and he did off the Star of the North Kingdom and gave it \\nto the keeping of the sons of Elrond. \\n\\nThen the Prince Imrahil and Jomer of Rohan left him and passed through \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe City and the tumult of the people, and mounted to the Citadel; and they \\ncame to the Hall of the Tower, seeking the Steward. But they found his chair \\nempty, and before the dais lay Thjoden King of the Mark upon a bed of state; \\nand twelve torches stood about it, and twelve guards, knights both of Rohan \\nand Gondor. And the hangings of the bed were of green and white, but upon \\nthe king was laid the great cloth of gold up to his breast, and upon that \\nhis unsheathed sword, and at his feet his shield, The light of the torches \\nshimmered in his white hair like sun in the spray of a fountain, but his \\nface was fair and young, save that a peace lay on it beyond the reach of \\nyouth; and it seemed that he slept. \\n\\nWhen they had stood silent for a time beside the king, Imrahil said: \\n\\'Where is the Steward? And where also is Mithrandir?\\' \\n\\nAnd one of the guards answered: \\'The Steward of Gondor is in the Houses \\nof Healing.\\' \\n\\nBut Jomer said: \\'Where is the Lady Jowyn, my sister; for surely she \\nshould be lying beside the king, and in no less honour? Where have they \\nbestowed her?\\' \\n\\nAnd Imrahil said: \\'But the Lady Jowyn was yet living when they bore her \\nhither. Did you not know?\\' \\n\\nThen hope unlooked-for came so suddenly to Jomer\\'s heart, and with it \\nthe bite of care and fear renewed, that he said no more, but turned and went \\nswiftly from the hall; and the Prince followed him. And when they came forth \\nevening had fallen and many stars were in the sky. And there came Gandalf on \\nfoot and with him one cloaked in grey; and they met before the doors of the \\nHouses of Healing. And they greeted Gandalf and said: \\'We seek the Steward, \\nand men say that he is in this House. Has any hurt befallen him? And the \\nLady Jowyn, where is she?\\' \\n\\nAnd Gandalf answered: \\'She lies within and is not dead, but is near \\ndeath. But the Lord Faramir was wounded by an evil dart, as you have heard, \\nand he is now the Steward; for Denethor has departed, and his house is in \\nashes.\\' And they were filled with grief and wonder at the tale that he told. \\n\\nBut Imrahil said: \\'So victory is shorn of gladness, and it is bitter \\nbought, if both Gondor and Rohan are in one day bereft of their lords. Jomer \\nrules the Rohirrim. Who shall rule the City meanwhile? Shall we not send now \\nfor the Lord Aragorn?\\' \\n\\nAnd the cloaked man spoke and said: \\'He is come.\\' And they saw as he \\nstepped into the light of the lantern by the door that it was Aragorn, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwrapped in the grey cloak of Lurien above his mail, and bearing no other \\ntoken than the green stone of Galadriel. \\'I have come because Gandalf begs \\nme to do so,\\' he said. \\'But for the present I am but the Captain of the \\nD(r)nedain of Arnor; and the Lord of Dol Amroth shall rule the City until \\nFaramir awakes. But it is my counsel that Gandalf should rule us all in the \\ndays that follow and in our dealings with the Enemy.\\' And they agreed upon \\nthat. \\n\\nThen Gandalf said: \\'Let us not stay at the door, for the time is \\nurgent. Let us enter! For it is only in the coming of Aragorn that any hope \\nremains for the sick that lie in the Flouse. Thus spake Ioreth, wise- woman of \\nGondor: The hands of the king are the hands of a healer, and so shall the \\nrightful king be known .\\' \\n\\nThen Aragorn entered first and the others followed. And there at the \\ndoor were two guards in the livery of the Citadel: one tall, but the other \\nscarce the height of a boy; and when he saw them he cried aloud in surprise \\nand joy. \\n\\n\\'Strider! Flow splendid! Do you know, I guessed it was you in the black \\nships. But they were all shouting corsairs and wouldn\\'t listen to me. How \\ndid you do it?\\' \\n\\nAragorn laughed, and took the hobbit by the hand. \\'Well met indeed!\\' he \\nsaid. \\'But there is not time yet for travellers\\' tales.\\' \\n\\nBut Imrahil said to Jomer: \\'Is it thus that we speak to our kings? Yet \\nmaybe he will wear his crown in some other name!\\' \\n\\nAnd Aragorn hearing him, turned and said: \\'Verily, for in the high \\ntongue of old I am Elessar, the Elfstone, and Envinyatar, the Renewed: and \\nhe lifted from his breast the green stone that lay there. \\'But Strider shall \\nbe the name of my house, if that be ever established. In the high tongue it \\nwill not sound so ill, and Telcontar I will be and all the heirs of my \\nbody.\\' \\n\\nAnd with that they passed into the House; and as they went towards the \\nrooms where the sick were tended Gandalf told of the deeds of Jowyn and \\nMeriadoc. \\'For,\\' he said, \\'long have I stood by them and at first they spoke \\nmuch in their dreaming, before they sank into the deadly darkness. Also it \\nis given to me to see many things far off.\\' \\n\\nAragorn went first to Faramir, and then to the Lady Jowyn, and last to \\nMerry. When he had looked on the faces of the sick and seen their hurts he \\nsighed. \\'Here I must put forth all such power and skill as is given to me,\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhe said. \\'Would that Elrond were here, for he is the eldest of all our race, \\nand has the greater power.\\' \\n\\nAnd Jomer seeing that he was sorrowful and weary said: \\'First you must \\nrest, surely, and at the least eat a little?\\' \\n\\nBut Aragorn answered: \\'Nay, for these three, and most soon for Faramir, \\ntime is running out. All speed is needed.\\' \\n\\nThen he called to Ioreth and he said: \\'You have store in this House of \\nthe herbs of healing?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, lord,\\' she answered; \\'but not enough, I reckon, for all that will \\nneed them. But I am sure I do not know where we shall find more; for all \\nthings are amiss in these dreadful days, what with fires and burnings, and \\nthe lads that run errands so few, and all the roads blocked. Why, it is days \\nout of count since ever a carrier came in from Fossarnach to the market! But \\nwe do our best in this House with what we have, as I am sure your lordship \\nwill know.\\' \\n\\n\\'I will judge that when I see,\\' said Aragorn. \\'One thing also is short \\ntime for speech. Have you athelasT \\n\\n\\'I do not know, I am sure, lord,\\' she answered, \\'at least not by that \\nname. I will go and ask of the herb-master; he knows all the old names.\\' \\n\\n\\'It is also called kingsfoil,\\' said Aragorn; \\'and maybe you know it by \\nthat name, for so the country-folk call it in these latter days.\\' \\'Oh that!\\' \\nsaid Ioreth. \\'Well, if your lordship had named it at first I could have told \\nyou. No, we have none of it, I am sure. Why, I have never heard that it had \\nany great virtue; and indeed I have often said to my sisters when we came \\nupon it growing in the woods: \"kingsfoil\" I said, \" \\'tis a strange name, and \\nI wonder why \\'tis called so; for if I were a king, I would have plants more \\nbright in my garden\". Still it smells sweet when bruised, does it not? If \\nsweet is the right word: wholesome, maybe, is nearer.\\' \\n\\n\\'Wholesome verily,\\' said Aragorn. \\'And now, dame, if you love the Ford \\nFaramir, run as quick as your tongue and get me kingsfoil, if there is a \\nleaf in the City.\\' \\n\\n\\'And if not,\\' said Gandalf, \\'I will ride to Fossarnach with Ioreth \\nbehind me, and she shall take me to the woods, but not to her sisters. And \\nShadowfax shall show her the meaning of haste.\\' \\n\\nWhen Ioreth was gone, Aragorn bade the other women to make water hot. \\nThen he took Faramir\\'s hand in his, and laid the other hand upon the sick \\nman\\'s brow. It was drenched with sweat; but Faramir did not move or make any \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsign, and seemed hardly to breathe. \\n\\n\\'He is nearly spent,\\' said Aragorn turning to Gandalf. \\'But this comes \\nnot from the wound. See! that is healing. Had he been smitten by some dart \\nof the Nazgyl, as you thought, he would have died that night. This hurt was \\ngiven by some Southron arrow, I would guess. Who drew it forth? Was it \\nkept?\\' \\n\\n\\'I drew it forth,\\' said Imrahil, \\'and staunched the wound. But I did \\nnot keep the arrow, for we had much to do. It was, as I remember, just such \\na dart as the Southrons use. Yet I believed that it came from the Shadows \\nabove, for else his fever and sickness were not to be understood; since the \\nwound was not deep or vital. How then do you read the matter?\\' \\n\\n\\'Weariness, grief for his father\\'s mood, a wound, and over all the \\nBlack Breath,\\' said Aragorn. \\'He is a man of staunch will, for already he \\nhad come close under the Shadow before ever he rode to battle on the \\nout- walls. Slowly the dark must have crept on him, even as he fought and \\nstrove to hold his outpost. Would that I could have been here sooner!\\' \\n\\nThereupon the herb-master entered. \\'Your lordship asked for kingsfoil, \\nas the rustics name it, he said; or athelas in the noble tongue, or to those \\nwho know somewhat of the Valinorean. . .\\' \\n\\n\\'I do so,\\' said Aragorn, \\'and I care not whether you say now asla \\naranion or kingsfoil, so long as you have some.\\' \\n\\n\\'Your pardon lord!\\' said the man. \\'I see you are a lore-master, not \\nmerely a captain of war. But alas ! sir, we do not keep this thing in the \\nHouses of Healing, where only the gravely hurt or sick are tended. For it \\nhas no virtue that we know of, save perhaps to sweeten a fouled air, or to \\ndrive away some passing heaviness. Unless, of course, you give heed to \\nrhymes of old days which women such as our good Ioreth still repeat without \\nunderstanding. \\n\\nWhen the black breath blows \\nand death \\'s shadow grows \\nand all lights pass, \\ncome athelas! come athelas! \\n\\nLife to the dying \\nIn the king\\'s hand lying! \\n\\nIt is but a doggrel, I fear, garbled in the memory of old wives. Its \\nmeaning I leave to your judgement, if indeed it has any. But old folk still \\nuse an infusion of the herb for headaches.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Then in the name of the king, go and find some old man of less lore \\nand more wisdom who keeps some in his house!\\' cried Gandalf. \\n\\nNow Aragorn knelt beside Faramir, and held a hand upon his brow. And \\nthose that watched felt that some great struggle was going on. For Aragorn\\'s \\nface grew grey with weariness; and ever and anon he called the name of \\nFaramir, but each time more faintly to their hearing, as if Aragorn himself \\nwas removed from them, and walked afar in some dark vale, calling for one \\nthat was lost. \\n\\nAnd at last Bergil came running in, and he bore six leaves in a cloth. \\n\\n\\'It is kingsfoil, Sir,\\' he said; \\'but not fresh, I fear. It must have been \\nculled two weeks ago at the least. I hope it will serve, Sir?\\' Then looking \\nat Faramir he burst into tears. \\n\\nBut Aragorn smiled. \\'It will serve,\\' he said. \\'The worst is now over. \\n\\nStay and be comforted!\\' Then taking two leaves, he laid them on his hands \\nand breathed on them, and then he crushed them, and straightway a living \\nfreshness filled the room, as if the air itself awoke and tingled, sparkling \\nwith joy. And then he cast the leaves into the bowls of steaming water that \\nwere brought to him, and at once all hearts were lightened. For the \\nfragrance that came to each was like a memory of dewy mornings of \\nunshadowed \\n\\nsun in some land of which the fair world in Spring is itself but a fleeting \\nmemory. But Aragorn stood up as one refreshed, and his eyes smiled as he \\nheld a bowl before Faramir\\'s dreaming face. \\n\\n\\'Well now! Who would have believed it?\\' said Ioreth to a woman that \\nstood beside her. \\'The weed is better than I thought. It reminds me of the \\nroses of Imloth Melui when I was a lass, and no king could ask for better.\\' \\n\\nSuddenly Faramir stirred, and he opened his eyes, and he looked on \\nAragorn who bent over him; and a light of knowledge and love was kindled in \\nhis eyes, and he spoke softly. \\'My lord, you called me. I come. What does \\nthe king command?\\' \\n\\n\\'Walk no more in the shadows, but awake!\\' said Aragorn. \\'You are weary. \\nRest a while, and take food, and be ready when I return.\\' \\n\\n\\'I will, lord,\\' said Faramir. \\'For who would lie idle when the king has \\nreturned?\\' \\n\\n\\'Farewell then for a while!\\' said Aragorn. \\'I must go to others who \\nneed me.\\' And he left the chamber with Gandalf and Imrahil; but Beregond and \\nhis son remained behind, unable to contain their joy. As he followed Gandalf \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand shut the door Pippin heard Ioreth exclaim: \\n\\n\\'King! Did you hear that? What did I say? The hands of a healer, I \\nsaid.\\' And soon the word had gone out from the House that the king was \\nindeed come among them, and after war he brought healing; and the news ran \\nthrough the City. \\n\\nBut Aragorn came to Jowyn, and he said: \\'Here there is a grievous hurt \\nand a heavy blow. The arm that was broken has been tended with due skill, \\nand it will mend in time, if she has the strength to live: It is the \\nshield-arm that is maimed; but the chief evil comes through the sword-arm. \\n\\nIn that there now seems no life, although it is unbroken. \\n\\n\\'Alas ! For she was pitted against a foe beyond the strength of her mind \\nor body. And those who will take a weapon to such an enemy must be sterner \\nthan steel, if the very shock shall not destroy them. It was an evil doom \\nthat set her in his path. For she is a fair maiden, fairest lady of a house \\nof queens. And yet I know not how I should speak of her. When I first looked \\non her and perceived her unhappiness, it seemed to me that I saw a white \\nflower standing straight and proud, shapely as a lily, and yet knew that it \\nwas hard, as if wrought by elf-wrights out of steel. Or was it, maybe, a \\nfrost that had turned its sap to ice, and so it stood, bitter-sweet, still \\nfair to see, but stricken, soon to fall and die? Her malady begins far back \\nbefore this day, does it not, Jomer?\\' \\n\\n\\'I marvel that you should ask me, lord,\\' he answered. \\'For I hold you \\nblameless in this matter, as in all else; yet I knew not that Jowyn, my \\nsister, was touched by any frost, until she first looked on you. Care and \\ndread she had, and shared with me, in the days of Wormtongue and the king\\'s \\nbewitchment; and she tended the king in growing fear. But that did not bring \\nher to this pass!\\' \\n\\n\\'My friend,\\' said Gandalf, \\'you had horses, and deeds of arms, and the \\nfree fields; but she, born in the body of a maid, had a spirit and courage \\nat least the match of yours. Yet she was doomed to wait upon an old man, \\nwhom she loved as a father, and watch him falling into a mean dishonoured \\ndotage; and her part seemed to her more ignoble than that of the staff he \\nleaned on. \\n\\n\\'Think you that Wormtongue had poison only for Thjoden\\'s ears? Dotard ! \\nWhat is the house of Eorl but a thatched barn where brigands drink in the \\nreek, and their brats roll on the floor among their dogs? Have you not heard \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthose words before? Saruman spoke them, the teacher of Wormtongue. Though \\n\\nI \\n\\ndo not doubt that Wormtongue at home wrapped their meaning in terms \\nmore \\n\\ncunning. My lord, if your sister\\'s love for you, and her will still bent to \\nher duty, had not restrained her lips; you might have heard even such things \\nas these escape them. But who knows what she spoke to the darkness, alone, \\nin the bitter watches of the night, when all her life seemed shrinking, and \\nthe walls of her bower closing in about her, a hutch to trammel some wild \\nthing in?\\' \\n\\nThen Jomer was silent, and looked on his sister, as if pondering anew \\nall the days of their past life together. But Aragorn said: \\'I saw also what \\nyou saw, Jomer. Few other griefs amid the ill chances of this world have \\nmore bitterness and shame for a man\\'s heart than to behold the love of a \\nlady so fair and brave that cannot be returned Sorrow and pity have followed \\nme ever since I left her desperate in Dunharrow and rode to the Paths of the \\nDead; and no fear upon that way was so present as the fear for what might \\nbefall her. And yet, Jomer, I say to you that she loves you more truly than \\nme; for you she loves and knows; but in me she loves only a shadow and a \\nthought: a hope of glory and great deeds, and lands far from the fields of \\nRohan. \\n\\n\\'I have, maybe, the power to heal her body, and to recall her from the \\ndark valley. But to what she will awake: hope, or forgetfulness, or despair, \\n\\nI do not know. And if to despair, then she will die, unless other healing \\ncomes which I cannot bring. Alas! for her deeds have set her among the \\nqueens of great renown.\\' \\n\\nThen Aragorn stooped and looked in her face, and it was indeed white as \\na lily, cold as frost, and hard as graven stone. But he bent and kissed her \\non the brow, and called her softly, saying: \\n\\n\\'Jowyn Jomund\\'s daughter, awake! For your enemy has passed away!\\' \\n\\nShe did not stir, but now she began again to breathe deeply, so that \\nher breast rose and fell beneath the white linen of the sheet. Once more \\nAragorn bruised two leaves of athelas and cast them into steaming water; and \\nhe laved her brow with it, and her right arm lying cold and nerveless on the \\ncoverlet. \\n\\nThen, whether Aragorn had indeed some forgotten power of Westernesse, \\nor whether it was but his words of the Lady Jowyn that wrought on them, as \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe sweet influence of the herb stole about the chamber it seemed to those \\nwho stood by that a keen wind blew through the window, and it bore no scent, \\nbut was an air wholly fresh and clean and young, as if it had not before \\nbeen breathed by any living thing and came new-made from snowy \\nmountains \\n\\nhigh beneath a dome of stars, or from shores of silver far away washed by \\nseas of foam. \\n\\n\\'Awake, Jowyn, Lady of Rohan!\\' said Aragorn again, and he took her \\nright hand in his and felt it warm with life returning. \\'Awake! The shadow \\nis gone and all darkness is washed clean!\\' Then he laid her hand in Jomer\\'s \\nand stepped away. \\'Call her!\\' he said, and he passed silently from the \\nchamber. \\n\\n\\'Jowyn, Jowyn!\\' cried Jomer amid his tears. But she opened her eyes and \\nsaid: \\'Jomer! What joy is this? For they said that you were slain. Nay, but \\nthat was only the dark voices in my dream. How long have I been dreaming?\\' \\n\\n\\'Not long, my sister,\\' said Jomer. \\'But think no more on it!\\' \\n\\n\\' I am strangely weary,\\' she said. \\'I must rest a little. But tell me, \\nwhat of the Lord of the Mark? Alas! Do not tell me that that was a dream for \\nI know that it was not. He is dead as he foresaw.\\' \\n\\n\\'He is dead,\\' said Jomer, \\'but he bade me say farewell to Jowyn dearer \\nthan daughter. He lies now in great honour in the Citadel of Gondor.\\' \\n\\n\\'That is grievous,\\' she said. \\'And yet it is good beyond all that I \\ndared hope in the dark days, when it seemed that the House of Eorl was sunk \\nin honour less than any shepherd\\'s cot. And what of the king\\'s esquire, the \\nHalfling? Jomer, you shall make him a knight of the Riddermark, for he is \\nvaliant!\\' \\n\\n\\'He lies nearby in this House, and I will go to him,\\' said Gandalf. \\n\\n\\'Jomer shall stay here for a while. But do not speak yet of war or woe, \\nuntil you are made whole again. Great gladness it is to see you wake again \\nto health and hope, so valiant a lady!\\' \\n\\n\\'To health?\\' said Jowyn. It may be so. At least while there is an \\nempty saddle of some fallen Rider that I can fill, and there are deeds to \\ndo. But to hope? I do not know.\\' \\n\\nGandalf and Pippin came to Merry\\'s room, and there they found Aragorn \\nstanding by the bed. \\'Poor old Merry!\\' cried Pippin, and he ran to the \\nbedside, for it seemed to him that his friend looked worse, and a greyness \\nwas in his face, as if a weight of years of sorrow lay on him; and suddenly \\n\\n\\n\\n\\na fear seized Pippin that Merry would die. \\n\\n\\'Do not be afraid,\\' said Aragorn. \\'I came in time, and I have called \\nhim back. He is weary now, and grieved, and he has taken a hurt like the \\nLady Jowyn, daring to smite that deadly thing. But these evils can be \\namended, so strong and gay a spirit is in him. His grief he will not forget; \\nbut it will not darken his heart, it will teach him wisdom.\\' \\n\\nThen Aragorn laid his hand on Merry\\'s head, and passing his hand gently \\nthrough the brown curls, he touched the eyelids, and called him by name. And \\nwhen the fragrance of athelas stole through the room, like the scent of \\norchards, and of heather in the sunshine full of bees, suddenly Merry awoke, \\nand he said: \\n\\n\\'I am hungry. What is the time?\\' \\n\\n\\'Past supper-time now,\\' said Pippin; \\'though I daresay I could bring \\nyou something, if they will let me.\\' \\n\\n\\'They will indeed,\\' said Gandalf. \\'And anything else that this Rider of \\nRohan may desire, if it can be found in Minas Tirith, where his name is in \\nhonour.\\' \\n\\n\\'Good!\\' said Merry. \\'Then I would like supper first, and after that a \\npipe.\\' At that his face clouded. \\'No, not a pipe. I don\\'t think I\\'ll smoke \\nagain.\\' \\n\\n\\'Why not?\\' said Pippin. \\n\\n\\'Well,\\' answered Merry slowly. \\'He is dead. It has brought it all back \\nto me. He said he was sorry he had never had a chance of talking herb-lore \\nwith me. Almost the last thing he ever said. I shan\\'t ever be able to smoke \\nagain without thinking of him, and that day, Pippin, when he rode up to \\nIsengard and was so polite.\\' \\n\\n\\'Smoke then, and think of him!\\' said Aragorn. \\'For he was a gentle \\nheart and a great king and kept his oaths; and he rose out of the shadows to \\na last fair morning. Though your service to him was brief, it should be a \\nmemory glad and honourable to the end of your days.\\' \\n\\nMerry smiled. \\'Well then,\\' he said, \\'if Strider will provide what is \\nneeded, I will smoke and think. I had some of Saruman\\'s best in my pack, but \\nwhat became of it in the battle, I am sure I don\\'t know.\\' \\n\\n\\'Master Meriadoc,\\' said Aragorn, \\'if you think that I have passed \\nthrough the mountains and the realm of Gondor with fire and sword to bring \\nherbs to a careless soldier who throws away his gear, you are mistaken. If \\nyour pack has not been found, then you must send for the herb-master of this \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHouse. And he will tell you that he did not know that the herb you desire \\nhad any virtues, but that it is called westmansweed by the vulgar, and \\ngalenas by the noble, and other names in other tongues more learned, and \\nafter adding a few half-forgotten rhymes that he does not understand, he \\nwill regretfully inform you that there is none in the House, and he will \\nleave you to reflect on the history of tongues. And so now must I. For I \\nhave not slept in such a bed as this, since I rode from Dunharrow, nor eaten \\nsince the dark before dawn.\\' \\n\\nMerry seized his hand and kissed it. \\'I am frightfully sorry,\\' he said. \\n\\n\\'Go at once! Ever since that night at Bree we have been a nuisance to you. \\n\\nBut it is the way of my people to use light words at such times and say less \\nthan they mean. We fear to say too much. It robs us of the right words when \\na jest is out of place.\\' \\n\\n\\'I know that well, or I would not deal with you in the same way \\' said \\nAragorn. \\'May the Shire live for ever unwithered!\\' And kissing Merry he went \\nout, and Gandalf went with him. \\n\\nPippin remained behind. \\'Was there ever any one like him?\\' he said. \\n\\'Except Gandalf, of course. I think they must be related. My dear ass, your \\npack is lying by your bed, and you had it on your back when I met you. He \\nsaw it all the time, of course. And anyway I have some stuff of my own. Come \\non now! Longbottom Leaf it is. Fill up while I run and see about some food. \\nAnd then let\\' s be easy for a bit. Dear me! We Tooks and Brandybucks, we \\ncan\\'t live long on the heights.\\' \\n\\n\\'No,\\' said Merry. \\'I can\\'t. Not yet, at any rate. But at least, Pippin, \\nwe can now see them, and honour them. It is best to love first what you are \\nfitted to love, I suppose: you must start somewhere and have some roots, and \\nthe soil of the Shire is deep. Still there are things deeper and higher; and \\nnot a gaffer could tend his garden in what he calls peace but for them, \\nwhether he knows about them or not. I am glad that I know about them, a \\nlittle. But I don\\'t know why I am talking like this. Where is that leaf? And \\nget my pipe out of my pack, if it isn\\'t broken.\\' \\n\\nAragorn and Gandalf went now to the Warden of the Houses of Healing, \\nand they counselled him that Faramir and Jowyn should remain there and still \\nbe tended with care for many days. \\n\\n\\'The Lady Jowyn,\\' said Aragorn, \\'will wish soon to rise and depart; but \\nshe should not be permitted to do so, if you can in any way restrain her, \\nuntil at least ten days be passed.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'As for Faramir,\\' said Gandalf, \\'he must soon learn that his father is \\ndead. But the full tale of the madness of Denethor should not be told to \\nhim, until he is quite healed and has duties to do. See that Beregond and \\nthe perian who were present do not speak to him of these things yet!\\' \\n\\nAnd the other perian Meriadoc who is under my care, what of him?\\' said \\nthe Warden. \\n\\n\\'It is likely that he will be fit to arise tomorrow, for a short \\nwhile,\\' said Aragorn. \\'Let him do so, if he wishes. He may walk a little in \\nthe care of his friends.\\' \\n\\n\\'They are a remarkable race,\\' said the Warden, nodding his head. \\'Very \\ntough in the fibre, I deem.\\' \\n\\nAt the doors of the Houses many were already gathered to see Aragorn, \\nand they followed after him; and when at last he had supped, men came and \\nprayed that he would heal their kinsmen or their friends whose lives were in \\nperil through hurt or wound, or who lay under the Black Shadow. And \\nAragorn \\n\\narose and went out, and he sent for the sons of Elrond, and together they \\nlaboured far into the night. And word went through the City: \\'The King is \\ncome again indeed.\\' And they named him Elfstone, because of the green stone \\nthat he wore, and so the name which it was foretold at his birth that he \\nshould bear was chosen for him by his own people. \\n\\nAnd when he could labour no more, he cast his cloak about him, and \\nslipped out of the City, and went to his tent just ere dawn and slept for a \\nlittle. And in the morning the banner of Dol Amroth, a white ship like a \\nswan upon blue water, floated from the Tower, and men looked up and \\nwondered \\n\\nif the coming of the King had been but a dream. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 9. The Last Debate \\n\\n\\n\\nThe morning came after the day of battle, and it was fair with light \\nclouds and the wind turning westward. Legolas and Gimli were early abroad, \\nand they begged leave to go up into the City; for they were eager to see \\nMerry and Pippin. \\n\\n\\'It is good to learn that they are still alive,\\' said Gimli; \\'for they \\ncost us great pains in our march over Rohan, and I would not have such pains \\nall wasted.\\' \\n\\nTogether the Elf and the Dwarf entered Minas Tirith, and folk that saw \\nthem pass marvelled to see such companions; for Legolas was fair of face \\nbeyond the measure of Men, and he sang an elven-song in a clear voice as he \\nwalked in the morning; but Gimli stalked beside him, stroking his beard and \\nstaring about him. \\n\\n\\'There is some good stone-work here,\\' he said as he looked at the \\nwalls; \\'but also some that is less good, and the streets could be better \\ncontrived. When Aragorn comes into his own, I shall offer him the service of \\nstone wrights of the Mountain, and we will make this a town to be proud of.\\' \\n\\n\\'They need more gardens,\\' said Legolas. \\'The houses are dead, and there \\nis too little here that grows and is glad. If Aragorn comes into his own, \\nthe people of the Wood shall bring him birds that sing and trees that do not \\ndie.\\' \\n\\nAt length they came to the Prince Imrahil, and Legolas looked at him \\nand bowed low; for he saw that here indeed was one who had elven-blood in \\nhis veins. \\'Hail, lord!\\' he said. \\'It is long since the people of Nimrodel \\nleft the woodlands of Lurien, and yet still one may see that not all sailed \\nfrom Amroth\\'s haven west over water.\\' \\n\\n\\'So it is said in the lore of my land,\\' said the Prince; \\'yet never has \\none of the fair folk been seen there for years beyond count. And I marvel to \\nsee one here now in the midst of sorrow and war. What do you seek?\\' \\n\\n\\'I am one of the Nine Companions who set out with Mithrandir from \\nImladris, said Legolas and with this Dwarf, my friend, I came with the Lord \\nAragorn. But now we wish to see our friends. Meriadoc and Peregrin, who are \\nin your keeping, we are told.\\' \\n\\n\\'You will find them in the Houses of Healing, and I will lead you \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthither,\\' said Imrahil. \\n\\n\\'It will be enough if you send one to guide us, lord,\\' said Legolas. \\n\\n\\'For Aragorn sends this message to you. He does not wish to enter the City \\nagain at this time. Yet there is need for the captains to hold council at \\nonce, and he prays that you and Jomer of Rohan will come down to his tents, \\nas soon as may be. Mithrandir is already there.\\' \\n\\n\\'We will come,\\' said Imrahil; and they parted with courteous words. \\n\\n\\'That is a fair lord and a great captain of men,\\' said Legolas. \\'If \\nGondor has such men still in these days of fading, great must have been its \\nglory in the days of its rising.\\' \\n\\n\\'And doubtless the good stone-work is the older and was wrought in the \\nfirst building,\\' said Gimli. \\'It is ever so with the things that Men begin: \\nthere is a frost in Spring, or a blight in Summer, and they fail of their \\npromise.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yet seldom do they fail of their seed,\\' said Legolas. \\'And that will \\nlie in the dust and rot to spring up again in times and places unlooked-for. \\n\\nThe deeds of Men will outlast us, Gimli.\\' \\n\\n\\'And yet come to naught in the end but might-have-beens, I guess,\\' said \\nthe Dwarf. \\n\\n\\'To that the Elves know not the answer,\\' said Legolas. \\n\\nWith that the servant of the Prince came and led them to the Houses of \\nHealing; and there they found their friends in the garden, and their meeting \\nwas a merry one. For a while they walked and talked, rejoicing for a brief \\nspace in peace and rest under the morning high up in the windy circles of \\nthe City. Then when Merry became weary, they went and sat upon the wall \\nwith \\n\\nthe greensward of the Houses of Healing behind them; and away southward \\nbefore them was the Anduin glittering in the sun, as it flowed away, out of \\nthe sight even of Legolas, into the wide flats and green haze of Lebennin \\nand South Ithilien. \\n\\nAnd now Legolas fell silent, while the others talked, and he looked out \\nagainst the sun, and as he gazed he saw white sea-birds beating up the \\nRiver. \\n\\n\\'Look!\\' he cried. \\'Gulls! They are flying far inland. A wonder they are \\nto me and a trouble to my heart. Never in all my life had I met them, until \\nwe came to Pelargir, and there I heard them crying in the air as we rode to \\nthe battle of the ships. Then I stood still, forgetting war in Middle-earth; \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfor their wailing voices spoke to me of the Sea. The Sea! Alas! I have not \\nyet beheld it. But deep in the hearts of all my kindred lies the \\nsea-longing, which it is perilous to stir. Alas! for the gulls. No peace \\nshall I have again under beech or under elm.\\' \\n\\n\\'Say not so!\\' said Gimli. \\'There are countless things still to see in \\nMiddle-earth, and great works to do. But if all the fair folk take to the \\nHavens, it will be a duller world for those who are doomed to stay.\\' \\n\\n\\'Dull and dreary indeed!\\' said Merry: \\'You must not go to the Havens, \\nLegolas. There will always be some folk, big or little, and even a few wise \\ndwarves like Gimli, who need you. At least I hope so. Though I feel somehow \\nthat the worst of this war is still to come. How I wish it was all over, and \\nwell over!\\' \\n\\n\\'Don\\'t be so gloomy!\\' cried Pippin. \\'The Sun is shining, and here we \\nare together for a day or two at least. I want to hear more about you all. \\n\\nCome, Gimli! You and Legolas have mentioned your strange journey with \\nStrider about a dozen times already this morning. But you haven\\'t told me \\nanything about it.\\' \\n\\n\\'The Sun may shine here,\\' said Gimli, \\'but there are memories of that \\nroad that I do not wish to recall out of the darkness. Had I known what was \\nbefore me, I think that not for any friendship would I have taken the Paths \\nof the Dead.\\' \\n\\n\\'The Paths of the Dead?\\' said Pippin. \\'I heard Aragorn say that and I \\nwondered what he could mean. Won\\'t you tell us some more?\\' \\n\\n\\'Not willingly,\\' said Gimli. \\'For upon that road I was put to shame: \\n\\nGimli Gluin\\'s son, who had deemed himself more tough than Men, and \\nhardier \\n\\nunder earth than any Elf. But neither did I prove; and I was held to the \\nroad only by the will of Aragorn.\\' \\n\\n\\'And by the love of him also,\\' said Legolas. \\'For all those who come to \\nknow him come to love him after his own fashion, even the cold maiden of the \\nRohirrim. It was at early morn of the day ere you came there, Merry, that we \\nleft Dunharrow, and such a fear was on all the folk that none would look on \\nour going, save the Lady Jowyn, who lies now hurt in the House below. There \\nwas grief at that parting, and I was grieved to behold it.\\' \\n\\n\\'Alas! I had heart only for myself,\\' said Gimli. \\'Nay! I will not speak \\nof that journey.\\' \\n\\nHe fell silent; but Pippin and Merry were so eager for news that at \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nlast Legolas said: \\'I will tell you enough for your peace; for I felt not \\nthe horror, and I feared not the shadows of Men, powerless and frail as I \\ndeemed them.\\' \\n\\nSwiftly then he told of the haunted road under the mountains, and the \\ndark tryst at Erech, and the great ride thence, ninety leagues and three, to \\nPelargir on Anduin. \\'Four days and nights, and on into a fifth, we rode from \\nthe Black Stone,\\' he said. \\'And lo! in the darkness of Mordor my hope rose; \\nfor in that gloom the Shadow Host seemed to grow stronger and more terrible \\nto look upon. Some I saw riding, some striding, yet all moving with the same \\ngreat speed. Silent they were, but there was a gleam in their eyes. In the \\nuplands of Lamedon they overtook our horses, and swept round us, and would \\nhave passed us by, if Aragorn had not forbidden them. \\n\\n\\'At his command they fell back. \"Even the shades of Men are obedient to \\nhis will,\" I thought. \"They may serve his needs yet! \" \\n\\n\\'One day of light we rode, and then came the day without dawn, and \\nstill we rode on, and Ciril and Ringlu we crossed; and on the third day we \\ncame to Linhir above the mouth of Gilrain. And there men of Lamedon \\ncontested the fords with fell folk of Umbar and Harad who had sailed up the \\nriver. But defenders and foes alike gave up the battle and fled when we \\ncame, crying out that the King of the Dead was upon them. Only Angbor, Lord \\nof Lamedon, had the heart to abide us; and Aragorn bade him gather his folk \\nand come behind, if they dared, when the Grey Host had passed. \\n\\n\\' \"At Pelargir the Heir of Isildur will have need of you,\" he said. \\n\\n\\'Thus we crossed over Gilrain, driving the allies of Mordor in rout \\nbefore us; and then we rested a while. But soon Aragorn arose, saying: \"Lo! \\nalready Minas Tirith is assailed. I fear that it will fall ere we come to \\nits aid.\" So we mounted again before night had passed and went on with all \\nthe speed that our horses could endure over the plains of Lebennin.\\' \\n\\nLegolas paused and sighed, and turning his eyes southward softly he \\nsang: \\n\\nSilver flow the streams from Celos to Erui \\nIn the green fields of Lebennin! \\n\\nTall grows the grass there. In the wind from the Sea \\nThe white lilies sway, \\n\\nAnd the golden bells are shaken of mallos and alfirin \\nIn the green fields of Lebennin, \\n\\nIn the wind from the Sea! \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Green are those fields in the songs of my people; but they were dark \\nthen, grey wastes in the blackness before us. And over the wide land, \\ntrampling unheeded the grass and the flowers, we hunted our foes through a \\nday and a night, until we came at the bitter end to the Great River at last. \\n\\nThen I thought in my heart that we drew near to the Sea; for wide was \\nthe water in the darkness, and sea-birds innumerable cried on its, shores. \\n\\nAlas for the wailing of the gulls ! Did not the Lady tell me to beware of \\nthem? And now I cannot forget them.\\' \\n\\n\\'For my part I heeded them not,\\' said Gimli; \\'for we came then at last \\nupon battle in earnest. There at Pelargir lay the main fleet of Umbar, fifty \\ngreat ships and smaller vessels beyond count. Many of those that we pursued \\nhad reached the havens before us, and brought their fear with them; and some \\nof the ships had put off, seeking to escape down the River or to reach the \\nfar shore; and many of the smaller craft were ablaze. But the Haradrim, \\nbeing now driven to the brink, turned at bay, and they were fierce in \\ndespair; and they laughed when they looked on us, for they were a great army \\nstill. \\n\\n\\'But Aragorn halted and cried with a great voice: \"Now come! By the \\nBlack Stone I call you! \" And suddenly the Shadow Host that had hung back at \\nthe last came up like a grey tide, sweeping all away before it. Faint cries \\nI heard, and dim horns blowing, and a murmur as of countless far voices: it \\nwas like the echo of some forgotten battle in the Dark Years long ago. Pale \\nswords were drawn; but I know not whether their blades would still bite, for \\nthe Dead needed no longer any weapon but fear. None would withstand them. \\n\\n\\'To every ship they came that was drawn up, and then they passed over \\nthe water to those that were anchored; and all the mariners were filled with \\na madness of terror and leaped overboard, save the slaves chained to the \\noars. Reckless we rode among our fleeing foes, driving them like leaves, \\nuntil we came to the shore. And then to each of the great ships that \\nremained Aragorn sent one of the D(r)nedain, and they comforted the captives \\nthat were aboard, and bade them put aside fear and be free. \\n\\n\\'Ere that dark day ended none of the enemy were left to resist us all \\nwere drowned, or were flying south in the hope to find their own lands upon \\nfoot. Strange and wonderful I thought it that the designs of Mordor should \\nbe overthrown by such wraiths of fear and darkness. With its own weapons was \\nit worsted!\\' \\n\\n\\'Strange indeed,\\' said Legolas. \\'In that hour I looked on Aragorn and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthought how great and terrible a Lord he might have become in the strength \\nof his will, had he taken the Ring to himself. Not for naught does Mordor \\nfear him. But nobler is his spirit than the understanding of Sauron; for is \\nhe not of the children of L(r)thien? Never shall that line fail, though the \\nyears may lengthen beyond count.\\' \\n\\n\\'Beyond the eyes of the Dwarves are such foretellings,\\' said Gimli. \\n\\n\\'But mighty indeed was Aragorn that day. Lo! all the black fleet was in his \\nhands; and he chose the greatest ship to be his own, and he went up into it. \\nThen he let sound a great concourse of trumpets taken from the enemy; and \\nthe Shadow Host withdrew to the shore. There they stood silent, hardly to be \\nseen, save for a red gleam in their eyes that caught the glare of the ships \\nthat were burning. And Aragorn spoke in a loud voice to the Dead Men, \\ncrying: \\n\\n\\' \"Hear now the words of the Heir of Isildur! Your oath is fulfilled. \\n\\nGo back and trouble not the valleys ever again! Depart and be at rest! \" \\n\\n\\'And thereupon the King of the Dead stood out before the host and broke \\nhis spear and cast it down. Then he bowed low and turned away; and swiftly \\nthe whole grey host drew off and vanished like a mist that is driven back by \\na sudden wind; and it seemed to me that I awoke from a dream. \\n\\n\\'That night we rested while others laboured. For there were many \\ncaptives set free, and many slaves released who had been folk of Gondor \\ntaken in raids; and soon also there was a great gathering of men out of \\nLebennin and the Ethir, and Angbor of Lamedon came up with all the \\nhorsemen \\n\\nthat he could muster. Now that the fear of the Dead was removed they came to \\naid us and to look on the Heir of Isildur; for the rumour of that name had \\nrun like fire in the dark. \\n\\n\\'And that is near the end of our tale. For during that evening and \\nnight many ships were made ready and manned; and in the morning the fleet \\nset forth. Long past it now seems, yet it was but the morn of the day ere \\nyesterday, the sixth since we rode from Dunharrow. But still Aragorn was \\ndriven by fear that time was too short. \\n\\n\\' \"It is forty leagues and two from Pelargir to the landings at the \\nHarlond,\" he said. \"Yet to the Harlond we must come tomorrow or fail \\nutterly.\" \\n\\n\\'The oars were now wielded by free men, and manfully they laboured; yet \\nslowly we passed up the Great River, for we strove against its stream, and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthough that is not swift down in the South, we had no help of wind. Heavy \\nwould my heart have been, for all our victory at the havens, if Legolas had \\nnot laughed suddenly. \\n\\n\\' \"Up with your beard, Durin\\'s son! \" he said. \"For thus is it spoken: \\n\\nOft hope is born, when all is forlorn.\" But what hope he saw from afar he \\nwould not tell. When night came it did but deepen the darkness, and our \\nhearts were hot, for away in the North we saw a red glow under the cloud, \\nand Aragorn said: \"Minas Tirith is burning.\" \\n\\n\\'But at midnight hope was indeed born anew. Sea -crafty men of the Ethir \\ngazing southward spoke of a change coming with a fresh wind from the Sea. \\nLong ere day the masted ships hoisted sail; and our speed grew, until dawn \\nwhitened the foam at our prows. And so it was, as you know, that we came in \\nthe third hour of the morning with a fair wind and the Sun unveiled, and we \\nunfurled the great standard in battle. It was a great day and a great hour, \\nwhatever may come after.\\' \\n\\n\\'Follow what may, great deeds are not lessened in worth,\\' said Legolas. \\n\\'Great deed was the riding of the Paths of the Dead, and great it shall \\nremain, though none be left in Gondor to sing of it in the days that are to \\ncome.\\' \\n\\n\\'And that may well befall,\\' said Gimli. \\'For the faces of Aragorn and \\nGandalf are grave. Much I wonder what counsels they are taking in the tents \\nthere below. For my part, like Merry, I wish that with our victory the war \\nwas now over. Yet whatever is still to do, I hope to have a part in it, for \\nthe honour of the folk of the Lonely Mountain.\\' \\n\\n\\'And I for the folk of the Great Wood,\\' said Legolas, \\'and for the love \\nof the Lord of the White Tree.\\' \\n\\nThen the companions fell silent, but a while they sat there in the high \\nplace, each busy with his own thoughts, while the Captains debated. \\n\\nWhen the Prince Imrahil had parted from Legolas and Gimli, at once he \\nsent for Jomer; and he went down with him from the City, and they came to \\nthe tents of Aragorn that were set up on the field not far from the place \\nwhere King Thjoden had fallen. And there they took counsel together with \\nGandalf and Aragorn and the sons of Elrond. \\n\\n\\'My lords,\\' said Gandalf, \\'listen to the words of the Steward of Gondor \\nbefore he died: You may triumph on the fields of the Pelennor for a day, but \\nagainst the Power that has now arisen there is no victory. I do not bid you \\ndespair, as he did, but to ponder the truth in these words. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Stones of Seeing do not lie, and not even the Lord of Barad-dyr \\ncan make them do so. He can, maybe, by his will choose what things shall be \\nseen by weaker minds, or cause them to mistake the meaning of what they see. \\nNonetheless it cannot be doubted that when Denethor saw great forces arrayed \\nagainst him in Mordor, and more still being gathered, he saw that which \\ntruly is. \\n\\n\\'Hardly has our strength sufficed to beat off the first great assault. \\n\\nThe next will be greater. This war then is without final hope, as Denethor \\nperceived. Victory cannot be achieved by arms, whether you sit here to \\nendure siege after siege, or march out to be overwhelmed beyond the River. \\nYou have only a choice of evils; and prudence would counsel you to \\nstrengthen such strong places as you have, and there await the onset; for so \\nshall the time before your end be made a little longer.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then you would have us retreat to Minas Tirith, or Dol Amroth, or to \\nDunharrow, and there sit like children on sand-castles when the tide is \\nflowing?\\' said Imrahil. \\n\\n\\'That would be no new counsel,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Have you not done this \\nand little more in all the days of Denethor? But no! I said this would be \\nprudent. I do not counsel prudence. I said victory could not be achieved by \\narms. I still hope for victory, but not by arms. For into the midst of all \\nthese policies comes the Ring of Power, the foundation of Barad-dyr, and the \\nhope of Sauron. \\n\\n\\'Concerning this thing, my lords, you now all know enough for the \\nunderstanding of our plight, and of Sauron\\' s. If he regains it, your valour \\nis vain, and his victory will be swift and complete: so complete that none \\ncan foresee the end of it while this world lasts. If it is destroyed, then \\nhe will fall; and his fall will be so low that none can foresee his arising \\never again. For he will lose the best part of the strength that was native \\nto him in his beginning, and all that was made or begun with that power will \\ncrumble, and he will be maimed for ever, becoming a mere spirit of malice \\nthat gnaws itself in the shadows, but cannot again grow or take shape. And \\nso a great evil of this world will be removed. \\n\\n\\'Other evils there are that may come; for Sauron is himself but a \\nservant or emissary. Yet it is not our part to master all the tides of the \\nworld, but to do what is in us for the succour of those years wherein we are \\nset, uprooting the evil in the fields that we know, so that those who live \\nafter may have clean earth to till. What weather they shall have is not ours \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nto rule. \\n\\n\\'Now Sauron knows all this, and he knows that this precious thing which \\nhe lost has been found again; but he does not yet know where it is, or so we \\nhope. And therefore he is now in great doubt. For if we have found this \\nthing, there are some among us with strength enough to wield it. That too he \\nknows. For do I not guess rightly, Aragorn, that you have shown yourself to \\nhim in the Stone of Orthanc?\\' \\n\\n\\'I did so ere I rode from the Flornburg,\\' answered Aragorn. \\'I deemed \\nthat the time was ripe, and that the Stone had come to me for just such a \\npurpose. It was then ten days since the Ring-bearer went east from Rauros, \\nand the Eye of Sauron, I thought, should be drawn out from his own land. Too \\nseldom has he been challenged since he returned to his Tower. Though if I \\nhad foreseen how swift would be his onset in answer, maybe I should not have \\ndared to show myself. Bare time was given me to come to your aid.\\' \\n\\n\\'But how is this?\\' asked Jomer. \\'All is vain, you say, if he has the \\nRing. Why should he think it not vain to assail us, if we have it?\\' \\n\\n\\'He is not yet sure,\\' said Gandalf, \\'and he has not built up his power \\nby waiting until his enemies are secure, as we have done. Also we could not \\nlearn how to wield the full power all in a day. Indeed it can be used only \\nby one master alone, not by many; and he will look for a time of strife, ere \\none of the great among us makes himself master and puts down the others. In \\nthat time the Ring might aid him, if he were sudden. \\n\\n\\'He is watching. He sees much and hears much. His Nazgyl are still \\nabroad. They passed over this field ere the sunrise, though few of the weary \\nand sleeping were aware of them. He studies the signs: the Sword that robbed \\nhim of his treasure re-made; the winds of fortune turning in our favour, and \\nthe defeat unlooked-for of his first assault the fall of his great Captain. \\n\\n\\'His doubt will be growing, even as we speak here. His Eye is now \\nstraining towards us, blind almost to all else that is moving. So we must \\nkeep it. Therein lies all our hope. This, then, is my counsel. We have not \\nthe Ring. In wisdom or great folly it has been sent away to be destroyed, \\nlest it destroy us. Without it we cannot by force defeat his force. But we \\nmust at all costs keep his Eye from his true peril. We cannot achieve \\nvictory by arms, but by arms we can give the Ring-bearer his only chance, \\nfrail though it be. \\n\\n\\'As Aragorn has begun, so we must go on. We must push Sauron to his \\nlast throw. We must call out his hidden strength, so that he shall empty his \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nland. We must march out to meet him at once. We must make ourselves the \\nbait, though his jaws should close on us. He will take that bait, in hope \\nand in greed, for he will think that in such rashness he sees the pride of \\nthe new Ringlord: and he will say: \"So! he pushes out his neck too soon and \\ntoo far. Let him come on, and behold I will have him in a trap from which he \\ncannot escape. There I will crush him, and what he has taken in his \\ninsolence shall be mine again for ever.\" \\n\\n\\'We must walk open-eyed into that trap, with courage, but small hope \\nfor ourselves. For, my lords, it may well prove that we ourselves shall \\nperish utterly in a black battle far from the living lands; so that even if \\nBarad-dyr be thrown down, we shall not live to see a new age. But this, I \\ndeem, is our duty. And better so than to perish nonetheless - as we surely \\nshall, if we sit here - and know as we die that no new age shall be.\\' \\n\\nThey were silent for a while. At length Aragorn spoke. \\'As I have \\nbegun, so I will go on. We come now to the very brink, where hope and \\ndespair are akin. To waver is to fall. Let none now reject the counsels of \\nGandalf, whose long labours against Sauron come at last to their test. But \\nfor him all would long ago have been lost. Nonetheless I do not yet claim to \\ncommand any man. Let others choose as they will.\\' \\n\\nThen said Elrohir: \\'From the North we came with this purpose, and from \\nElrond our father we brought this very counsel. We will not turn back.\\' \\n\\n\\'As for myself,\\' said Jomer, \\'I have little knowledge of these deep \\nmatters; but I need it not. This I know, and it is enough, that as my friend \\nAragorn succoured me and my people, so I will aid him when he calls. I will \\n\\ngo-\\' \\n\\n\\'As for me,\\' said Imrahil, \\'the Lord Aragorn I hold to be my \\nliege-lord, whether he claim it or no. His wish is to me a command. I will \\ngo also. Yet for a while I stand in the place of the Steward of Gondor, and \\nit is mine to think first of its people. To prudence some heed must still be \\ngiven. For we must prepare against all chances, good as well as evil. Now, \\nit may be that we shall triumph, and while there is any hope of this, Gondor \\nmust be protected. I would not have us return with victory to a City in \\nruins and a land ravaged behind us. And yet we learn from the Rohirrim that \\nthere is an army still unfought upon our northern flank.\\' \\n\\n\\'That is true,\\' said Gandalf. \\'I do not counsel you to leave the City \\nall unmanned. Indeed the force that we lead east need not be great enough \\nfor any assault in earnest upon Mordor, so long as it be great enough to \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchallenge battle. And it must move soon. Therefore I ask the Captains: what \\nforce could we muster and lead out in two days\\' time at the latest? And they \\nmust be hardy men that go willingly, knowing their peril.\\' \\n\\n\\'All are weary, and very many have wounds light or grievous,\\' said \\nJomer, \\'and we have suffered much loss of our horses, and that is ill to \\nbear. If we must ride soon, then I cannot hope to lead even two thousands, \\nand yet leave as many for the defence of the City.\\' \\n\\n\\'We have not only to reckon with those who fought on this field \\' said \\nAragorn. \\'New strength is on the way from the southern fiefs, now that the \\ncoasts have been rid. Four thousands I sent marching from Pelargir through \\nLossarnach two days ago; and Angbor the fearless rides before them. If we \\nset out in two days more, they will draw nigh ere we depart. Moreover many \\nwere bidden to follow me up the River in any craft they could gather; and \\nwith this wind they will soon be at hand, indeed several ships have already \\ncome to the Harlond. I judge that we could lead out seven thousands of horse \\nand foot, and yet leave the City in better defence than it was when the \\nassault began.\\' \\n\\n\\'The Gate is destroyed,\\' said Imrahil, \\'and where now is the skill to \\nrebuild it and set it up anew?\\' \\n\\n\\'In Erebor in the Kingdom of Dbin there is such skill,\\' said Aragorn; \\n\\n\\'and if all our hopes do not perish, then in time I will send Gimli Gluin\\'s \\nson to ask for wrights of the Mountain. But men are better than gates, and \\nno gate will endure against our Enemy if men desert it.\\' \\n\\nThis then was the end of the debate of the lords: that they should set \\nforth on the second morning from that day with seven thousands, if these \\nmight be found; and the great part of this force should be on foot, because \\nof the evil lands into which they would go. Aragorn should find some two \\nthousands of those that he had gathered to him in the South; but Imrahil \\nshould find three and a half thousands; and Jomer five hundreds of the \\nRohirrim who were unhorsed but themselves warworthy, and he himself \\nshould \\n\\nlead five hundreds of his best Riders on horse; and another company of five \\nhundred horse there should be, among which should ride the sons of Elrond \\nwith the D(r)nedain and the knights of Dol Amroth: all told six thousand foot \\nand a thousand horse. But the main strength of the Rohirrim that remained \\nhorsed and able to fight, some three thousand under the command of Elfhelm, \\nshould waylay the West Road against the enemy that was in Anurien. And at \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nonce swift riders were sent out to gather what news they could northwards; \\nand eastwards from Osgiliath and the road to Minas Morgul. \\n\\nAnd when they had reckoned up all their strength and taken thought for \\nthe journeys they should make and the roads they should choose, Imrahil \\nsuddenly laughed aloud. \\n\\n\\'Surely,\\' he cried, \\'this is the greatest jest in all the history of \\nGondor: that we should ride with seven thousands, scarce as many as the \\nvanguard of its army in the days of its power, to assail the mountains and \\nthe impenetrable gate of the Black Land! So might a child threaten a \\nmail-clad knight with a bow of string and green willow! If the Dark Lord \\nknows so much as you say, Mithrandir, will he not rather smile than fear, \\nand with his little finger crush us like a fly that tries to sting him?\\' \\n\\n\\'No, he will try to trap the fly and take the sting,\\' said Gandalf. \\n\\n\\'And there are names among us that are worth more than a thousand mail-clad \\nknights apiece. No, he will not smile.\\' \\n\\n\\'Neither shall we,\\' said Aragorn. \\'If this be jest, then it is too \\nbitter for laughter. Nay, it is the last move in a great jeopardy, and for \\none side or the other it will bring the end of the game.\\' Then he drew \\nAnd(r)ril and held it up glittering in the sun. \\'You shall not be sheathed \\nagain until the last battle is fought;\\' he said. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 10. The Black Gate Opens \\n\\n\\n\\nTwo days later the army of the West was all assembled on the Pelennor. \\nThe host of Ores and Easterlings had turned back out of Anurien, but harried \\nand scattered by the Rohirrim they had broken and fled with little fighting \\ntowards Cair Andros; and with that threat destroyed and new strength \\narriving out of the South the City was as well manned as might be. Scouts \\nreported that no enemies remained upon the roads east as far as the \\nCross-roads of the Fallen King. All now was ready for the last throw. \\n\\nLegolas and Gimli were to ride again together in the company of Aragorn \\nand Gandalf, who went in the van with the D(r)nedain and the sons of Elrond. \\nBut Merry to his shame was not to go with them. \\n\\n\\'You are not fit for such a journey,\\' said Aragorn. \\'But do not be \\nashamed. If you do no more in this war, you have already earned great \\nhonour. Peregrin shall go and represent the Shirefolk; and do not grudge him \\nhis chance of peril, for though he has done as well as his fortune allowed \\nhim, he has yet to match your deed. But in truth all now are in like danger. \\nThough it may be our part to find bitter end before the Gate of Mordor, if \\nwe do so, then you will come also to a last stand, either here or wherever \\nthe black tide overtakes you. Farewell!\\' \\n\\nAnd so despondently Merry now stood and watched the mustering of the \\narmy. Bergil was with him, and he also was downcast; for his father was to \\nmarch leading a company of the Men of the City: he could not rejoin the \\nGuard until his case was judged. In that same company Pippin was also to go, \\nas a soldier of Gondor. Merry could see him not far off, a small but upright \\nfigure among the tall men of Minas Tirith. \\n\\nAt last the trumpets rang and the army began to move. Troop by troop, \\nand company by company, they wheeled and went off eastward. And long \\nafter \\n\\nthey had passed away out of sight down the great road to the Causeway, Merry \\nstood there. The last glint of the morning sun on spear and helm twinkled \\nand was lost, and still he remained with bowed head and heavy heart, feeling \\nfriendless and alone. Everyone that he cared for had gone away into the \\ngloom that hung over the distant eastern sky; and little hope at all was \\nleft in his heart that he would ever see any of them again. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs if recalled by his mood of despair, the pain in his arm returned, \\nand he felt weak and old, and the sunlight seemed thin. He was roused by the \\ntouch of Bergil\\'s hand. \\n\\n\\'Come, Master Perian!\\' said the lad. \\'You are still in pain, I see. I \\nwill help you back to the Healers. But do not fear! They will come back. The \\nMen of Minas Tirith will never be overcome. And now they have the Lord \\nElf stone, and Beregond of the Guard too.\\' \\n\\nEre noon the army came to Osgiliath. There all the workers and \\ncraftsmen that could be spared were busy. Some were strengthening the \\nferries and boat-bridges that the enemy had made and in part destroyed when \\nthey fled; some gathered stores and booty; and others on the eastern side \\nacross the River were throwing up hasty works of defence. \\n\\nThe vanguard passed on through the ruins of Old Gondor, and over the \\nwide River, and on up the long straight road that in the high days had been \\nmade to run from the fair Tower of the Sun to the tall Tower of the Moon, \\nwhich now was Minas Morgul in its accursed vale. Five miles beyond Osgiliath \\nthey halted, ending their first day\\'s march. \\n\\nBut the horsemen pressed on and ere evening they came to the \\nCross-roads and the great ring of trees, and all was silent. No sign of any \\nenemy had they seen, no cry or call had been heard, no shaft had sped from \\nrock or thicket by the way, yet ever as they went forward they felt the \\nwatchfulness of the land increase. Tree and stone, blade and leaf were \\nlistening. The darkness had been dispelled, and far away westward sunset was \\non the Vale of Anduin, and the white peaks of the mountains blushed in the \\nblue air; but a shadow and a gloom brooded upon the Ephel D(r)ath. \\n\\nThen Aragorn set trumpeters at each of the four roads that ran into the \\nring of trees, and they blew a great fanfare, and the heralds cried aloud: \\n\\n\\'The Lords of Gondor have returned and all this land that is theirs they \\ntake back.\\' The hideous ore-head that was set upon the carven figure was \\ncast down and broken in pieces, and the old king\\'s head was raised and set \\nin its place once more, still crowned with white and golden flowers: and men \\nlaboured to wash and pare away all the foul scrawls that ores had put upon \\nthe stone. \\n\\nNow in their debate some had counselled that Minas Morgul should first \\nbe assailed, and if they might take it, it should be utterly destroyed. \\n\\n\\'And, maybe,\\' said Imrahil, \\'the road that leads thence to the pass above \\nwill prove an easier way of assault upon the Dark Lord than his northern \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngate.\\' \\n\\nBut against this Gandalf had spoken urgently, because of the evil that \\ndwelt in the valley, where the minds of living men would turn to madness and \\nhorror, and because also of the news that Faramir had brought. For if the \\nRing-bearer had indeed attempted that way, then above all they should not \\ndraw the Eye of Mordor thither. So the next day when the main host came up, \\nthey set a strong guard upon the Cross-roads to make some defence, if Mordor \\nshould send a force over the Morgul Pass, or should bring more men up from \\nthe South. For that guard they chose mostly archers who knew the ways of \\nIthilien and would lie hid in the woods and slopes about the meeting of the \\nways. But Gandalf and Aragorn rode with the vanguard to the entrance of \\nMorgul Vale and looked on the evil city. \\n\\nIt was dark and lifeless; for the Ores and lesser creatures of Mordor \\nthat had dwelt there had been destroyed in battle, and the Nazgyl were \\nabroad. Yet the air of the valley was heavy with fear and enmity. Then they \\nbroke the evil bridge and set red flames in the noisome fields and departed. \\n\\nThe day after, being the third day since they set out from Minas \\nTirith, the army began its northward march along the road. It was some \\nhundred miles by that way from the Cross-roads to the Morannon, and what \\nmight befall them before they came so far none knew They went openly but \\nheedfully, with mounted scouts before them on the road, and others on foot \\nupon either side, especially on the eastward flank; for there lay dark \\nthickets, and a tumbled land of rocky ghylls and crags, behind which the \\nlong grim slopes of the Ephel D(r)ath clambered up. The weather of the world \\nremained fair and the wind held in the west, but nothing could waft away the \\nglooms and the sad mists that clung about the Mountains of Shadow; and \\nbehind them at whiles great smokes would arise and hover in the upper winds. \\n\\nEver and anon Gandalf let blow the trumpets, and the heralds would cry: \\n\"The Lords of Gondor are come! Let all leave this land or yield them up!\\' \\nBut Imrahil said: \\'Say not The Lords of Gondor. Say The King Elessar. For \\nthat is true, even though he has not yet sat upon the throne; and it will \\ngive the Enemy more thought, if the heralds use that name.\\' And thereafter \\nthrice a day the heralds proclaimed the coming of the King Elessar. But none \\nanswered the challenge. \\n\\nNonetheless, though they marched in seeming peace, the hearts of all \\nthe army, from the highest to the lowest, were downcast, and with every mile \\nthat they went north foreboding of evil grew heavier on them. It was near \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe end of the second day of their march from the Cross-roads that they \\nfirst met any offer of battle. For a strong force of Ores and Easterlings \\nattempted to take their leading companies in an ambush; and that was in the \\nvery place where Faramir had waylaid the men of Flarad, and the road went in \\na deep cutting through an out-thrust of the eastward hills. But the Captains \\nof the West were well warned by their scouts, skilled men from Henneth \\nAnnyn \\n\\nled by Mablung; and so the ambush was itself trapped. For horsemen went \\nwide \\n\\nabout westward and came up on the flank of the enemy and from behind, and \\nthey were destroyed or driven east into the hills. \\n\\nBut the victory did little to enhearten the captains. \\'It is but a \\nfeint,\\' said Aragorn; \\'and its chief purpose, I deem, was rather to draw us \\non by a false guess of our Enemy\\'s weakness than to do us much hurt, yet.\\' \\nAnd from that evening onward the Nazgyl came and followed every move of \\nthe \\n\\narmy. They still flew high and out of sight of all save Legolas, and yet \\ntheir presence could be felt, as a deepening of shadow and a dimming of the \\nsun; and though the Ring wraiths did not yet stoop low upon their foes and \\nwere silent, uttering no cry, the dread of them could not be shaken off. \\n\\nSo time and the hopeless journey wore away. Upon the fourth day from \\nthe Cross-roads and the sixth from Minas Tirith they came at last to the end \\nof the living lands, and began to pass into the desolation that lay before \\nthe gates of the Pass of Cirith Gorgor; and they could descry the marshes \\nand the desert that stretched north and west to the Emyn Muil. So desolate \\nwere those places and so deep the horror that lay on them that some of the \\nhost were unmanned, and they could neither walk nor ride further north. \\n\\nAragorn looked at them, and there was pity in his eyes rather than \\nwrath; for these were young men from Rohan, from Westfold far away, or \\nhusbandmen from Lossarnach, and to them Mordor had been from childhood \\na \\n\\nname of evil, and yet unreal, a legend that had no part in their simple \\nlife; and now they walked like men in a hideous dream made true, and they \\nunderstood not this war nor why fate should lead them to such a pass. \\n\\n\\'Go!\\' said Aragorn. \\'But keep what honour you may, and do not run! And \\nthere is a task which you may attempt and so be not wholly shamed. Take your \\nway south-west till you come to Cair Andros, and if that is still held by \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nenemies, as I think, then re-take it, if you can; and hold it to the last in \\ndefence of Gondor and Rohan!\\' \\n\\nThen some being shamed by his mercy overcame their fear and went on, \\nand the others took new hope, hearing of a manful deed within their measure \\nthat they could turn to, and they departed. And so, since many men had \\nalready been left at the Cross-roads, it was with less than six thousands \\nthat the Captains of the West came at last to challenge the Black Gate and \\nthe might of Mordor. \\n\\nThey advanced now slowly, expecting at every hour some answer to their \\nchallenge, and they drew together, since it was but waste of men to send out \\nscouts or small parties from the main host. At nightfall of the fifth day of \\nthe march from Morgul Vale they made their last camp, and set fires about it \\nof such dead wood and heath as they could find. They passed the hours of \\nnight in wakefulness and they were aware of many things half-seen that \\nwalked and prowled all about them, and they heard the howling of wolves. The \\nwind had died and all the air seemed still. They could see little, for \\nthough it was cloudless and the waxing moon was four nights old, there were \\nsmokes and fumes that rose out of the earth and the white crescent was \\nshrouded in the mists of Mordor. \\n\\nIt grew cold. As morning came the wind began to stir again, but now it \\ncame from the North, and soon it freshened to a rising breeze. All the \\nnight-walkers were gone, and the land seemed empty. North amid their \\nnoisome \\n\\npits lay the first of the great heaps and hills of slag and broken rock and \\nblasted earth, the vomit of the maggot-folk of Mordor; but south and now \\nnear loomed the great rampart of Cirith Gorgor, and the Black Gate amidmost, \\nand the two Towers of the Teeth tall and dark upon either side. For in their \\nlast march the Captains had turned away from the old road as it bent east, \\nand avoided the peril of the lurking hills, and so now they were approaching \\nthe Morannon from the north-west, even as Frodo had done. \\n\\nThe two vast iron doors of the Black Gate under its frowning arch were \\nfast closed. Upon the battlement nothing could be seen. All was silent but \\nwatchful. They were come to the last end of their folly, and stood forlorn \\nand chill in the grey light of early day before towers and walls which their \\narmy could not assault with hope, not even if it had brought thither engines \\nof great power, and the Enemy had no more force than would suffice for the \\nmanning of the gate and wall alone. Yet they knew that all the hills and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nrocks about the Morannon were filled with hidden foes, and the shadowy \\ndefile beyond was bored and tunnelled by teeming broods of evil things. And \\nas they stood they saw all the Nazgyl gathered together, hovering above the \\nTowers of the Teeth like vultures; and they knew that they were watched. But \\nstill the Enemy made no sign. \\n\\nNo choice was left them but to play their part to its end. Therefore \\nAragorn now set the host in such array as could best be contrived; and they \\nwere drawn up on two great hills of blasted stone and earth that ores had \\npiled in years of labour. Before them towards Mordor lay like a moat a great \\nmire of reeking mud and foul-smelling pools. When all was ordered, the \\nCaptains rode forth towards the Black Gate with a great guard of horsemen \\nand the banner and heralds and trumpeters. There was Gandalf as chief \\nherald, and Aragorn with the sons of Elrond, and Jomer of Rohan, and \\nImrahil; and Legolas and Gimli and Peregrin were bidden to go also, so that \\nall the enemies of Mordor should have a witness. \\n\\nThey came within cry of the Morannon, and unfurled the banner, and blew \\nupon their trumpets; and the heralds stood out and sent their voices up over \\nthe battlement of Mordor. \\n\\n\\'Come forth!\\' they cried. \\'Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth! \\nJustice shall be done upon him. Lor wrongfully he has made war upon Gondor \\nand wrested its lands. Therefore the King of Gondor demands that he should \\natone for his evils, and depart then for ever. Come forth!\\' \\n\\nThere was a long silence, and from wall and gate no cry or sound was \\nheard in answer. But Sauron had already laid his plans, and he had a mind \\nfirst to play these mice cruelly before he struck to kill. So it was that, \\neven as the Captains were about to turn away, the silence was broken \\nsuddenly. There came a long rolling of great drums like thunder in the \\nmountains, and then a braying of horns that shook the very stones and \\nstunned men\\'s ears. And thereupon the middle door of the Black Gate was \\nthrown open with a great clang, and out of it there came an embassy from the \\nDark Tower. \\n\\nAt its head there rode a tall and evil shape, mounted upon a black \\nhorse, if horse it was; for it was huge and hideous, and its face was a \\nfrightful mask, more like a skull than a living head, and in the sockets of \\nits eyes and in its nostrils there burned a flame. The rider was robed all \\nin black, and black was his lofty helm; yet this was no Ringwraith but a \\nliving man. The Lieutenant of the Tower of Barad-dyr he was, and his name is \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nremembered in no tale; for he himself had forgotten it, and he said: \\'I am \\nthe Mouth of Sauron.\\' But it is told that he was a renegade, who came of the \\nrace of those that are named the Black N(r)menureans; for they established \\ntheir dwellings in Middle-earth during the years of Sauron\\'s domination, and \\nthey worshipped him, being enamoured of evil knowledge. And he entered the \\nservice of the Dark Tower when it first rose again, and because of his \\ncunning he grew ever higher in the Lord\\'s favour; and he learned great \\nsorcery, and knew much of the mind of Sauron; and he was more cruel than \\nany \\nore. \\n\\nHe it was that now rode out, and with him came only a small company of \\nblack-harnessed soldiery, and a single banner, black but bearing on it in \\nred the Evil Eye. Now halting a few paces before the Captains of the West he \\nlooked them up and down and laughed. \\n\\n\\'Is there anyone in this rout with authority to treat with me?\\' he \\nasked. \\'Or indeed with wit to understand me? Not thou at least!\\' he mocked, \\nturning to Aragorn with scorn. \\'It needs more to make a king than a piece of \\nelvish glass, or a rabble such as this. Why, any brigand of the hills can \\nshow as good a following!\\' \\n\\nAragorn said naught in answer, but he took the other\\'s eye and held it, \\nand for a moment they strove thus; but soon, though Aragorn did not stir nor \\nmove hand to weapon, the other quailed and gave back as if menaced with a \\nblow. \\'I am a herald and ambassador, and may not be assailed!\\' he cried. \\n\\n\\'Where such laws hold,\\' said Gandalf, \\'it is also the custom for \\nambassadors to use less insolence. But no one has threatened you. You have \\nnaught to fear from us, until your errand is done. But unless your master \\nhas come to new wisdom, then with all his servants you will be in great \\nperil.\\' \\n\\n\\'So!\\' said the Messenger. \\'Then thou art the spokesman, old greybeard? \\n\\nHave we not heard of thee at whiles, and of thy wanderings, ever hatching \\nplots and mischief at a safe distance? But this time thou hast stuck out thy \\nnose too far, Master Gandalf; and thou shalt see what comes to him who sets \\nhis foolish webs before the feet of Sauron the Great. I have tokens that I \\nwas bidden to show to thee - to thee in especial, if thou shouldst dare to \\ncome.\\' He signed to one of his guards, and he came forward bearing a bundle \\nswathed in black cloths. \\n\\nThe Messenger put these aside, and there to the wonder and dismay of \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nall the Captains he held up first the short sword that Sam had carried, and \\nnext a grey cloak with an el ven -brooch, and last the coat of mithril-mail \\nthat Frodo had worn wrapped in his tattered garments. A blackness came \\nbefore their eyes, and it seemed to them in a moment of silence that the \\nworld stood still, but their hearts were dead and their last hope gone. \\n\\nPippin who stood behind Prince Imrahil sprang forward with a cry of grief. \\n\\n\\'Silence!\\' said Gandalf sternly, thrusting him back; but the Messenger \\nlaughed aloud. \\n\\n\\'So you have yet another of these imps with you!\\' he cried. \\'What use \\nyou find in them I cannot guess; but to send them as spies into Mordor is \\nbeyond even your accustomed folly. Still, I thank him, for it is plain that \\nthis brat at least has seen these tokens before, and it would be vain for \\nyou to deny them now.\\' \\n\\n\\'I do not wish to deny them,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Indeed, I know them all \\nand all their history, and despite your scorn, foul Mouth of Sauron, you \\ncannot say as much. But why do you bring them here?\\' \\n\\n\\'Dwarf-coat, elf-cloak, blade of the downf alien West, and spy from the \\nlittle rat-land of the Shire-nay; do not start! We know it well - here are \\nthe marks of a conspiracy. Now, maybe he that bore these things was a \\ncreature that you would not grieve to lose, and maybe otherwise: one dear to \\nyou, perhaps? If so, take swift counsel with what little wit is left to you. \\n\\nFor Sauron does not love spies, and what his fate shall be depends now on \\nyour choice.\\' \\n\\nNo one answered him; but he saw their faces grey with fear and the \\nhorror in their eyes, and he laughed again, for it seemed to him that his \\nsport went well. \\'Good, good!\\' he said. \\'He was dear to you, I see. Or else \\nhis errand was one that you did not wish to fail? It has. And now he shall \\nendure the slow torment of years, as long and slow as our arts in the Great \\nTower can contrive, and never be released, unless maybe when he is changed \\nand broken, so that he may come to you, and you shall see what you have \\ndone. This shall surely be-unless you accept my Lord\\'s terms.\\' \\n\\n\\'Name the terms,\\' said Gandalf steadily, but those nearby saw the \\nanguish in his face, and now he seemed an old and wizened man, crushed, \\ndefeated at last. They did not doubt that he would accept. \\n\\n\\'These are the terms,\\' said the Messenger, and smiled as he eyed them \\none by one. \\'The rabble of Gondor and its deluded allies shall withdraw at \\nonce beyond the Anduin, first taking oaths never again to assail Sauron the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGreat in arms, open or secret. All lands east of Anduin shall be Sauron\\'s \\nfor ever, solely. West of the Anduin as far as the Misty Mountains and the \\nGap of Rohan shall be tributary to Mordor, and men there shall bear no \\nweapons, but shall have leave to govern their own affairs. But they shall \\nhelp to rebuild Isengard which they have wantonly destroyed, and that shall \\nbe Sauron\\'s, and there his lieutenant shall dwell: not Saruman, but one more \\nworthy of trust.\\' \\n\\nLooking in the Messenger\\'s eyes they read his thought. He was to be \\nthat lieutenant, and gather all that remained of the West under his sway; he \\nwould be their tyrant and they his slaves. \\n\\nBut Gandalf said: \\'This is much to demand for the delivery of one \\nservant: that your Master should receive in exchange what he must else fight \\nmany a war to gain! Or has the field of Gondor destroyed his hope in war, so \\nthat he falls to haggling? And if indeed we rated this prisoner so high, \\nwhat surety have we that Sauron the Base Master of Treachery, will keep his \\npart? Where is this prisoner? Let him be brought forth and yielded to us, \\nand then we will consider these demands.\\' \\n\\nIt seemed then to Gandalf, intent, watching him as a man engaged in \\nfencing with a deadly foe, that for the taking of a breath the Messenger was \\nat a loss; yet swiftly he laughed again. \\n\\n\\'Do not bandy words in your insolence with the Mouth of Sauron!\\' he \\ncried. \\'Surety you crave! Sauron gives none. If you sue for his clemency you \\nmust first do his bidding. These are his terms. Take them or leave them!\\' \\n\\n\\'These we will take!\\' said Gandalf suddenly. He cast aside his cloak \\nand a white light shone forth like a sword in that black place. Before his \\nupraised hand the foul Messenger recoiled, and Gandalf coming seized and \\ntook from him the tokens: coat, cloak, and sword. \\'These we will take in \\nmemory of our friend,\\' he cried. \\'But as for your terms, we reject them \\nutterly. Get you gone, for your embassy is over and death is near to you. We \\ndid not come here to waste words in treating with Sauron, faithless and \\naccursed; still less with one of his slaves. Begone!\\' \\n\\nThen the Messenger of Mordor laughed no more. His face was twisted with \\namazement and anger to the likeness of some wild beast that, as it crouches \\non its prey, is smitten on the muzzle with a stinging rod. Rage filled him \\nand his mouth slavered, and shapeless sounds of fury came strangling from \\nhis throat. But he looked at the fell faces of the Captains and their deadly \\neyes, and fear overcame his wrath. He gave a great cry, and turned, leaped \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nupon his steed, and with his company galloped madly back to Cirith Gorgor. \\nBut as they went his soldiers blew their horns in signal long arranged; and \\neven before they came to the gate Sauron sprang his trap. \\n\\nDrums rolled and fires leaped up. The great doors of the Black Gate \\nswung back wide. Out of it streamed a great host as swiftly as swirling \\nwaters when a sluice is lifted. \\n\\nThe Captains mounted again and rode back, and from the host of Mordor \\nthere went up a jeering yell. Dust rose smothering the air, as from nearby \\nthere marched up an army of Easterlings that had waited for the signal in \\nthe shadows of Ered Lithui beyond the further Tower. Down from the hills on \\neither side of the Morannon poured Ores innumerable. The men of the West \\nwere trapped, and soon, all about the grey mounds where they stood, forces \\nten times and more than ten times their match would ring them in a sea of \\nenemies. Sauron had taken the proffered bait in jaws of steel. \\n\\nLittle time was left to Aragorn for the ordering of his battle. Upon \\nthe one hill he stood with Gandalf, and there fair and desperate was raised \\nthe banner of the Tree and Stars. Upon the other hill hard by stood the \\nbanners of Rohan and Dol Amroth, White Elorse and Silver Swan. And about \\neach \\n\\nhill a ring was made facing all ways, bristling with spear and sword. But in \\nthe front towards Mordor where the first bitter assault would come there \\nstood the sons of Elrond on the left with the D(r)nedain about them, and on \\nthe right the Prince Imrahil with the men of Dol Amroth tall and fair, and \\npicked men of the Tower of Guard. \\n\\nThe wind blew, and the trumpets sang, and arrows whined; but the sun \\nnow climbing towards the South was veiled in the reeks of Mordor, and \\nthrough a threatening haze it gleamed, remote, a sullen red, as if it were \\nthe ending of the day, or the end maybe of all the world of light. And out \\nof the gathering mirk the Nazgyl came with, their cold voices crying words \\nof death; and then all hope was quenched. \\n\\nPippin had bowed crushed with horror when he heard Gandalf reject the \\nterms and doom Frodo to the torment of the Tower; but he had mastered \\nhimself, and now he stood beside Beregond in the front rank of Gondor with \\nImrahil\\'s men. For it seemed best to him to die soon and leave the bitter \\nstory of his life, since all was in ruin. \\n\\n\\'I wish Merry was here,\\' he heard himself saying, and quick thoughts \\nraced through his mind, even as he watched the enemy come charging to the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nassault. \\'Well, well, now at any rate I understand poor Denethor a little \\nbetter. We might die together, Merry and I, and since die we must, why not? \\nWell, as he is not here, I hope he\\'ll find an easier end. But now I must do \\nmy best.\\' \\n\\nHe drew his sword and looked at it, and the intertwining shapes of red \\nand gold; and the flowing characters of N(r)menor glinted like fire upon the \\nblade. \\'This was made for just such an hour,\\' he thought. \\'If only I could \\nsmite that foul Messenger with it, then almost I should draw level with old \\nMerry. Well, I\\'ll smite some of this beastly brood before the end. I wish I \\ncould see cool sunlight and green grass again!\\' \\n\\nThen even as he thought these things the first assault crashed into \\nthem. The ores hindered by the mires that lay before the hills halted and \\npoured their arrows into the defending ranks. But through them there came \\nstriding up, roaring like beasts, a great company of hill-trolls out of \\nGorgoroth. Taller and broader than Men they were, and they were clad only in \\nclose-fitting mesh of horny scales, or maybe that was their hideous hide; \\nbut they bore round bucklers huge and black and wielded heavy hammers in \\ntheir knotted hands. Reckless they sprang into the pools and waded across, \\nbellowing as they came. Like a storm they broke upon the line of the men of \\nGondor, and beat upon helm and head, and arm and shield as smiths hewing the \\nhot bending iron. At Pippin\\'s side Beregond was stunned and overborne, and \\nhe fell; and the great troll-chief that smote him down bent over him, \\nreaching out a clutching claw; for these fell creatures would bite the \\nthroats of those that they threw down. \\n\\nThen Pippin stabbed upwards, and the written blade of Westernesse \\npierced through the hide and went deep into the vitals of the troll, and his \\nblack blood came gushing out. He toppled forward and came crashing down \\nlike \\n\\na falling rock, burying those beneath him. Blackness and stench and crushing \\npain came upon Pippin, and his mind fell away into a great darkness. \\n\\n\\'So it ends as I guessed it would,\\' his thought said, even as it \\nfluttered away; and it laughed a little within him ere it fled, almost gay \\nit seemed to be casting off at last all doubt and care and fear. And then \\neven as it winged away into forgetfulness it heard voices, and they seemed \\nto be crying in some forgotten world far above: \\n\\n\\'The Eagles are coming! The Eagles are coming!\\' \\n\\nFor one moment more Pippin\\'s thought hovered. \\'Bilbo!\\' it said. \\'But \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nno! That came in his tale, long long ago. This is my tale, and it is ended \\nnow. Good-bye!\\' And his thought fled far away and his eyes saw no more. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 1 . The Tower of Cirith Ungol \\n\\n\\n\\nSam roused himself painfully from the ground. For a moment he wondered \\nwhere he was, and then all the misery and despair returned to him. He was in \\nthe deep dark outside the under -gate of the ores\\' stronghold; its brazen \\ndoors were shut. He must have fallen stunned when he hurled himself against \\nthem; but how long he had lain there he did not know. Then he had been on \\nfire, desperate and furious; now he was shivering and cold. He crept to the \\ndoors and pressed his ears against them. \\n\\nFar within he could hear faintly the voices of ores clamouring, but \\nsoon they stopped or passed out of hearing, and all was still. His head \\nached and his eyes saw phantom lights in the darkness, but he struggled to \\nsteady himself and think. It was clear at any rate that he had no hope of \\ngetting into the ore-hold by that gate; he might wait there for days before \\nit was opened, and he could not wait: time was desperately precious. He no \\nlonger had any doubt about his duty: he must rescue his master or perish in \\nthe attempt. \\n\\nThe perishing is more likely, and will be a lot easier anyway,\\' he \\nsaid grimly to himself, as he sheathed Sting and turned from the brazen \\ndoors. Slowly he groped his way back in the dark along the tunnel, not \\ndaring to use the elven-light; and as he went he tried to fit together the \\nevents since Frodo and he had left the Cross-roads. He wondered what the \\ntime was. Somewhere between one day and the next, he supposed; but even of \\nthe days he had quite lost count. He was in a land of darkness where the \\ndays of the world seemed forgotten, and where all who entered were forgotten \\ntoo. \\n\\nT wonder if they think of us at all,\\' he said, \\'and what is happening \\nto them all away there.\\' He waved his hand vaguely in the air before him; \\nbut he was in fact now facing southwards, as he came back to Shelob\\'s \\ntunnel, not west. Out westward in the world it was drawing to noon upon the \\nfourteenth day of March in the Shire-reckoning. And even now Aragorn was \\nleading the black fleet from Pelargir, and Merry was riding with the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRohirrim down the Stonewain Valley, while in Minas Tirith flames were rising \\nand Pippin watched the madness growing in the eyes of Denethor. Yet amid all \\ntheir cares and fear the thoughts of their friends turned constantly to \\nFrodo and Sam. They were not forgotten. But they were far beyond aid, and no \\nthought could yet bring any help to Samwise Hamfast\\'s son; he was utterly \\nalone. \\n\\nHe came back at last to the stone door of the ore-passage, and still \\nunable to discover the catch or bolt that held it, he scrambled over as \\nbefore and dropped softly to the ground. Then he made his way stealthily to \\nthe outlet of Shelob\\'s tunnel, where the rags of her great web were still \\nblowing and swaying in the cold airs. For cold they seemed to Sam after the \\nnoisome darkness behind; but the breath of them revived him. He crept \\ncautiously out. \\n\\nAll was ominously quiet. The light was no more than that of dusk at a \\ndark day\\'s end. The vast vapours that arose in Mordor and went streaming \\nwestward passed low overhead, a great welter of cloud and smoke now lit \\nagain beneath with a sullen glow of red. \\n\\nSam looked up towards the ore-tower, and suddenly from its narrow \\nwindows lights stared out like small red eyes. He wondered if they were some \\nsignal. His fear of the ores, forgotten for a while in his wrath and \\ndesperation, now returned. As far as he could see, there was only one \\npossible course for him to take: he must go on and try to find the main \\nentrance to the dreadful tower; but his knees felt weak, and he found that \\nhe was trembling. Drawing his eyes down from the tower and the horns of the \\nCleft before him, he forced his unwilling feet to obey him, and slowly, \\nlistening with all his ears, peering into the dense shadows of the rocks \\nbeside the way, he retraced his steps, past the place where Frodo fell, and \\nstill the stench of Shelob lingered, and then on and up, until he stood \\nagain in the very cleft where he had put on the Ring and seen Shagrat\\'s \\ncompany go by. \\n\\nThere he halted and sat down. For the moment he could drive himself no \\nfurther. He felt that if once he went beyond the crown of the pass and took \\none step veritably down into the land of Mordor, that step would be \\nirrevocable. He could never come back. Without any clear purpose he drew out \\nthe Ring and put it on again. Immediately he felt the great burden of its \\nweight, and felt afresh, but now more strong and urgent than ever, the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmalice of the Eye of Mordor, searching, trying to pierce the shadows that it \\nhad made for its own defence, but which now hindered it in its unquiet and \\ndoubt. \\n\\nAs before, Sam found that his hearing was sharpened, but that to his \\nsight the things of this world seemed thin and vague. The rocky walls of the \\npath were pale, as if seen through a mist, but still at a distance he heard \\nthe bubbling of Shelob in her misery: and harsh and clear, and very close it \\nseemed, he heard cries and the clash of metal. He sprang to his feet, and \\npressed himself against the wall beside the road. He was glad of the Ring, \\nfor here was yet another company of ores on the march. Or so at first he \\nthought. Then suddenly he realized that it was not so, his hearing had \\ndeceived him: the orc-cries came from the tower, whose topmost horn was \\nnow \\n\\nright above him, on the left hand of the Cleft. \\n\\nSam shuddered and tried to force himself to move. There was plainly \\nsome devilry going on. Perhaps in spite of all orders the cruelty of the \\nores had mastered them, and they were tormenting Frodo, or even savagely \\nhacking him to pieces. He listened; and as he did a gleam of hope came to \\nhim. There could not be much doubt: there was fighting in the tower, the \\nores must be at war among themselves, Shagrat and Gorbag had come to \\nblows. \\n\\nFaint as was the hope that his guess brought him, it was enough to rouse \\nhim. There might be just a chance. His love for Frodo rose above all other \\nthoughts, and forgetting his peril he cried aloud: \\'I\\'m coming, Mr. Frodo!\\' \\n\\nHe ran forward to the climbing path, and over it. At once the road \\nturned left and plunged steeply down. Sam had crossed into Mordor. \\n\\nHe took off the Ring, moved it may be by some deep premonition of \\ndanger, though to himself he thought only that he wished to see more \\nclearly. \\'Better have a look at the worst,\\' he muttered. \\'No good blundering \\nabout in a fog!\\' \\n\\nHard and cruel and bitter was the land that met his gaze. Before his \\nfeet the highest ridge of the Ephel D(r)ath fell steeply in great cliffs down \\ninto a dark trough, on the further side of which there rose another ridge, \\nmuch lower, its edge notched and jagged with crags like fangs that stood out \\nblack against the red light behind them: it was the grim Morgai, the inner \\nring of the fences of the land. Far beyond it, but almost straight ahead, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nacross a wide lake of darkness dotted with tiny fires, there was a great \\nburning glow; and from it rose in huge columns a swirling smoke, dusty red \\nat the roots, black above where it merged into the billowing canopy that \\nroofed in all the accursed land. \\n\\nSam was looking at Orodruin, the Mountain of Fire. Ever and anon the \\nfurnaces far below its ashen cone would grow hot and with a great surging \\nand throbbing pour forth rivers of molten rock from chasms in its sides. \\nSome would flow blazing towards Barad-dyr down great channels; some \\nwould \\n\\nwind their way into the stony plain, until they cooled and lay like twisted \\ndragon- shapes vomited from the tormented earth. In such an hour of labour \\nSam beheld Mount Doom, and the light of it, cut off by the high screen of \\nthe Ephel D(r)ath from those who climbed up the path from the West, now \\nglared \\n\\nagainst the stark rock faces, so that they seemed to be drenched with blood. \\n\\nIn that dreadful light Sam stood aghast, for now, looking to his left, \\nhe could see the Tower of Cirith Ungol in all its strength. The horn that he \\nhad seen from the other side was only its topmost turret. Its eastern face \\nstood up in three great tiers from a shelf in the mountain- wall far below; \\nits back was to a great cliff behind, from which it jutted out in pointed \\nbastions, one above the other, diminishing as they rose, with sheer sides of \\ncunning masonry that looked north-east and south-east. About the lowest \\ntier, two hundred feet below where Sam now stood, there was a battlemented \\nwall enclosing a narrow court. Its gate, upon the near south-eastern side, \\nopened on a broad road, the outer parapet of which ran upon the brink of a \\nprecipice, until it turned southward and went winding down into the darkness \\nto join the road that came over the Morgul Pass. Then on it went through a \\njagged rift in the Morgai out into the valley of Gorgoroth and away to \\nBarad-dyr. The narrow upper way on which Sam stood leapt swiftly down \\nby \\n\\nstair and steep path to meet the main road under the frowning walls close to \\nthe Tower-gate. \\n\\nAs he gazed at it suddenly Sam understood, almost with a shock, that \\nthis stronghold had been built not to keep enemies out of Mordor, but to \\nkeep them in. It was indeed one of the works of Gondor long ago, an eastern \\noutpost of the defences of Ithilien, made when, after the Last Alliance, Men \\nof Westernesse kept watch on the evil land of Sauron where his creatures \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstill lurked. But as with Narchost and Carchost, the Towers of the Teeth, so \\nhere too the vigilance had failed, and treachery had yielded up the Tower to \\nthe Lord of the Ring wraiths, and now for long years it had been held by evil \\nthings. Since his return to Mordor, Sauron had found it useful; for he had \\nfew servants but many slaves of fear, and still its chief purpose as of old \\nwas to prevent escape from Mordor. Though if an enemy were so rash as to try \\nto enter that land secretly, then it was also a last unsleeping guard \\nagainst any that might pass the vigilance of Morgul and of Shelob. \\n\\nOnly too clearly Sam saw how hopeless it would be for him to creep down \\nunder those many-eyed walls and pass the watchful gate. And even if he did \\nso, he could not go far on the guarded road beyond: not even the black \\nshadows, lying deep where the red glow could not reach, would shield him \\nlong from the night-eyed ores. But desperate as that road might be, his task \\nwas now far worse: not to avoid the gate and escape, but to enter it, alone. \\n\\nHis thought turned to the Ring, but there was no comfort there, only \\ndread and danger. No sooner had he come in sight of Mount Doom, burning \\nfar \\n\\naway, than he was aware of a change in his burden. As it drew near the great \\nfurnaces where, in the deeps of time, it had been shaped and forged, the \\nRing\\'s power grew, and it became more fell, untameable save by some mighty \\nwill. As Sam stood there, even though the Ring was not on him but hanging by \\nits chain about his neck, he felt himself enlarged, as if he were robed in a \\nhuge distorted shadow of himself, a vast and ominous threat halted upon the \\nwalls of Mordor. He felt that he had from now on only two choices: to \\nforbear the Ring, though it would torment him; or to claim it, and challenge \\nthe Power that sat in its dark hold beyond the valley of shadows. Already \\nthe Ring tempted him, gnawing at his will and reason. Wild fantasies arose \\nin his mind; and he saw Samwise the Strong, Hero of the Age, striding with a \\nflaming sword across the darkened land, and armies flocking to his call as \\nhe marched to the overthrow of Barad-dyr. And then all the clouds rolled \\naway, and the white sun shone, and at his command the vale of Gorgoroth \\nbecame a garden of flowers and trees and brought forth fruit. He had only to \\nput on the Ring and claim it for his own, and all this could be. \\n\\nIn that hour of trial it was the love of his master that helped most to \\nhold him firm; but also deep down in him lived still unconquered his plain \\nhobbit-sense: he knew in the core of his heart that he was not large enough \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nto bear such a burden, even if such visions were not a mere cheat to betray \\nhim. The one small garden of a free gardener was all his need and due, not a \\ngarden swollen to a realm; his own hands to use, not the hands of others to \\ncommand. \\n\\n\\'And anyway all these notions are only a trick,\\' he said to himself. \\n\\n\\'He\\'d spot me and cow me, before I could so much as shout out. He\\'d spot me, \\npretty quick, if I put the Ring on now, in Mordor. Well, all I can say is: \\nthings look as hopeless as a frost in spring. Just when being invisible \\nwould be really useful, I can\\'t use the Ring! And if ever I get any further, \\nit\\'s going to be nothing but a drag and a burden every step. So what\\'s to be \\ndone?\\' \\n\\nHe was not really in any doubt. He knew that he must go down to the \\ngate and not linger any more. With a shrug of his shoulders, as if to shake \\noff the shadow and dismiss the phantoms, he began slowly to descend. With \\neach step he seemed to diminish. He had not gone far before he had shrunk \\nagain to a very small and frightened hobbit. He was now passing under the \\nvery walls of the Tower, and the cries and sounds of fighting could be heard \\nwith his unaided ears. At the moment the noise seemed to be coming from the \\ncourt behind the outer wall. \\n\\nSam was about half way down the path when out of the dark gateway into \\nthe red glow there came two ores running. They did not turn towards him. \\nThey were making for the main road; but even as they ran they stumbled and \\nfell to the ground and lay still. Sam had seen no arrows, but he guessed \\nthat the ores had been shot down by others on the battlements or hidden in \\nthe shadow of the gate. He went on, hugging the wall on his left. One look \\nupward had shown him that there was no hope of climbing it. The stone-work \\nrose thirty feet, without a crack or ledge, to overhanging courses like \\ninverted steps. The gate was the only way. \\n\\nHe crept on; and as he went he wondered how many ores lived in the \\nTower with Shagrat, and how many Gorbag had, and what they were \\nquarrelling \\n\\nabout, if that was what was happening. Shagrat\\'s company had seemed to be \\nabout forty, and Gorbag\\'s more than twice as large; but of course Shagrat\\'s \\npatrol had only been a part of his garrison. Almost certainly they were \\nquarrelling about Frodo, and the spoil. For a second Sam halted, for \\nsuddenly things seemed clear to him, almost as if he had seen them with his \\n\\n\\n\\n\\neyes. The mithril coat! Of course, Frodo was wearing it, and they would find \\nit. And from what Sam had heard Gorbag would covet it. But the orders of the \\nDark Tower were at present Frodo\\'s only protection, and if they were set \\naside, Frodo might be killed out of hand at any moment. \\n\\n\\'Come on, you miserable sluggard!\\' Sam cried to himself. \\'Now for it!\\' \\n\\nHe drew Sting and ran towards the open gate. But just as he was about to \\npass under its great arch he felt a shock: as if he had run into some web \\nlike Shelob\\'s, only invisible. He could see no obstacle, but something too \\nstrong for his will to overcome barred the way. He looked about, and then \\nwithin the shadow of the gate he saw the Two Watchers. \\n\\nThey were like great figures seated upon thrones. Each had three joined \\nbodies, and three heads facing outward, and inward, and across the gateway. \\nThe heads had vulture-faces, and on their great knees were laid clawlike \\nhands. They seemed to be carved out of huge blocks of stone, immovable, and \\nyet they were aware: some dreadful spirit of evil vigilance abode in them. \\nThey knew an enemy. Visible or invisible none could pass unheeded. They \\nwould forbid his entry, or his escape. \\n\\nHardening his will Sam thrust forward once again, and halted with a \\njerk, staggering as if from a blow upon his breast and head. Then greatly \\ndaring, because he could think of nothing else to do, answering a sudden \\nthought that came to him, he drew slowly out the phial of Galadriel and held \\nit up. Its white light quickened swiftly, and the shadows under the dark \\narch fled. The monstrous Watchers sat there cold and still, revealed in all \\ntheir hideous shape. For a moment Sam caught a glitter in the black stones \\nof their eyes, the very malice of which made him quail; but slowly he felt \\ntheir will waver and crumble into fear. \\n\\nHe sprang past them; but even as he did so, thrusting the phial back \\ninto his bosom, he was aware, as plainly as if a bar of steel had snapped to \\nbehind him, that their vigilance was renewed. And from those evil heads \\nthere came a high shrill cry that echoed in the towering walls before him. \\n\\nFar up above, like an answering signal, a harsh bell clanged a single \\nstroke. \\n\\n\\'That\\'s done it!\\' said Sam. \\'Now I\\'ve rung the front-door bell! Well, \\ncome on somebody!\\' he cried. \\'Tell Captain Shagrat that the great \\nElf-warrior has called, with his elf-sword too!\\' \\n\\nThere was no answer. Sam strode forward. Sting glittered blue in his \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhand. The courtyard lay in deep shadow, but he could see that the pavement \\nwas strewn with bodies. Right at his feet were two ore-archers with knives \\nsticking in their backs. Beyond lay many more shapes; some singly as they \\nhad been hewn down or shot; others in pairs, still grappling one another, \\ndead in the very throes of stabbing, throttling, biting. The stones were \\nslippery with dark blood. \\n\\nTwo liveries Sam noticed, one marked by the Red Eye, the other by a \\nMoon disfigured with a ghastly face of death; but he did not stop to look \\nmore closely. Across the court a great door at the foot of the Tower stood \\nhalf open, and a red light came through; a large ore lay dead upon the \\nthreshold. Sam sprang over the body and went in; and then he peered about at \\na loss. \\n\\nA wide and echoing passage led back from the door towards the \\nmountain-side. It was dimly lit with torches flaring in brackets on the \\nwalls, but its distant end was lost in gloom. Many doors and openings could \\nbe seen on this side and that; but it was empty save for two or three more \\nbodies sprawling on the floor. From what he had heard of the captains\\' talk \\nSam knew that, dead or alive, Frodo would most likely be found in a chamber \\nhigh up in the turret far above; but he might search for a day before he \\nfound the way. \\n\\n\\'It\\'ll be near the back, I guess,\\' Sam muttered. \\'The whole Tower \\nclimbs backwards-like. And anyway I\\'d better follow these lights.\\' \\n\\nHe advanced down the passage, but slowly now, each step more reluctant. \\nTerror was beginning to grip him again. There was no sound save the rap of \\nhis feet, which seemed to grow to an echoing noise, like the slapping of \\ngreat hands upon the stones. The dead bodies: the emptiness; the dank black \\nwalls that in the torchlight seemed to drip with blood; the fear of sudden \\ndeath lurking in doorway or shadow; and behind all his mind the waiting \\nwatchful malice at the gate: it was almost more than he could screw himself \\nto face. He would have welcomed a fight-with not too many enemies at a time \\n- rather than this hideous brooding uncertainty. He forced himself to think \\nof Frodo, lying bound or in pain or dead somewhere in this dreadful place. \\n\\nHe went on. \\n\\nHe had passed beyond the torchlight, almost to a great arched door at \\nthe end of the passage, the inner side of the under gate, as he rightly \\nguessed, when there came from high above a dreadful choking shriek. He \\nstopped short. Then he heard feet coming. Someone was running in great haste \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndown an echoing stairway overhead. \\n\\nHis will was too weak and slow to restrain his hand. It dragged at the \\nchain and clutched the Ring. But Sam did not put it on; for even as he \\nclasped it to his breast, an ore came clattering down. Leaping out of a dark \\nopening at the right, it ran towards him. It was no more than six paces from \\nhim when, lifting its head, it saw him; and Sam could hear its gasping \\nbreath and see the glare in its bloodshot eyes. It stopped short aghast. For \\nwhat it saw was not a small frightened hobbit trying to hold a steady sword: \\nit saw a great silent shape, cloaked in a grey shadow, looming against the \\nwavering light behind; in one hand it held a sword, the very light of which \\nwas a bitter pain, the other was clutched at its breast, but held concealed \\nsome nameless menace of power and doom. \\n\\nFor a moment the ore crouched, and then with a hideous yelp of fear it \\nturned and fled back as it had come. Never was any dog more heartened when \\nits enemy turned tail than Sam at this unexpected flight. With a shout he \\ngave chase. \\n\\n\\'Yes! The Elf- warrior is loose!\\' he cried. \\'I\\'m coming. Just you show \\nme the way up, or I\\'ll skin you!\\' \\n\\nBut the ore was in its own haunts, nimble and well-fed. Sam was a \\nstranger, hungry and weary. The stairs were high and steep and winding. \\nSam\\'s breath began to come in gasps. The ore had soon passed out of sight, \\nand now only faintly could be heard the slapping of its feet as it went on \\nand up. Every now and again it gave a yell, and the echo ran along the \\nwalls. But slowly all sound of it died away. \\n\\nSam plodded on. He felt that he was on the right road, and his spirits \\nhad risen a good deal. He thrust the Ring away and tightened his belt. \\n\\n\\'Well, well!\\' he said. \\'If only they all take such a dislike to me and my \\nSting, this may turn out better than I hoped. And anyway it looks as if \\nShagrat, Gorbag, and company have done nearly all my job for me. Except for \\nthat little frightened rat, I do believe there\\'s nobody left alive in the \\nplace!\\' \\n\\nAnd with that he stopped, brought up hard, as if he had hit his head \\nagainst the stone wall. The full meaning of what he had said struck him like \\na blow. Nobody left alive! Whose had been that horrible dying shriek? \\n\\'Frodo, Frodo! Master!\\' he cried half sobbing. \\'If they\\'ve killed you, what \\nshall I do? Well, I\\'m coming at last, right to the top, to see what I must.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUp, up he went. It was dark save for an occasional torch flaring at a \\nturn, or beside some opening that led into the higher levels of the Tower. \\nSam tried to count the steps, but after two hundred he lost his reckoning. \\n\\nHe was moving quietly now: for he thought that he could hear the sound of \\nvoices talking, still some way above. More than one rat remained alive, it \\nseemed. \\n\\nAll at once, when he felt that he could pump out no more breath, nor \\nforce his knees to bend again, the stair ended. He stood still. The voices \\nwere now loud and near. Sam peered about. He had climbed right to the flat \\nroof of the third and highest tier of the Tower: an open space, about twenty \\nyards across, with a low parapet. There the stair was covered by a small \\ndomed chamber in the midst of the roof, with low doors facing east and west. \\nEastward Sam could see the plain of Mordor vast and dark below, and the \\nburning mountain far away. A fresh turmoil was surging in its deep wells, \\nand the rivers of fire blazed so fiercely that even at this distance of many \\nmiles the light of them lit the tower -top with a red glare. Westward the \\nview was blocked by the base of the great turret that stood at the back of \\nthis upper court and reared its horn high above the crest of the encircling \\nhills. Light gleamed in a window-slit. Its door was not ten yards from where \\nSam stood. It was open but dark, and from just within its shadow the voices \\ncame. \\n\\nAt first Sam did not listen; he took a pace out of the eastward door \\nand looked about. At once he saw that up here the fighting had been \\nfiercest. All the court was choked with dead ores or their severed and \\nscattered heads and limbs. The place stank of death. A snarl followed by a \\nblow and a cry sent him darting back into hiding. An ore-voice rose in \\nanger, and he knew it again at once, harsh, brutal, cold. It was Shagrat \\nspeaking, Captain of the Tower. \\n\\n\\'You won\\'t go again, you say? Curse you, Snaga, you little maggot! If \\nyou think I\\'m so damaged that it\\'s safe to flout me, you\\'re mistaken Come \\nhere, and I\\'ll squeeze your eyes out, like I did to Radbug just now. And \\nwhen some new lads come, I\\'ll deal with you: I\\'ll send you to Shelob.\\' \\n\\n\\'They won\\'t come, not before you\\'re dead anyway,\\' answered Snaga \\nsurlily. \\'I\\'ve told you twice that Gorbag\\'s swine got to the gate first, and \\nnone of ours got out. Lagduf and Muzgash ran through, but they were shot. I \\nsaw it from a window, I tell you. And they were the last.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then you must go. I must stay here anyway. But I\\'m hurt. The Black \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPits take that filthy rebel Gorbag!\\' Shagrat\\'s voice trailed off into a \\nstring of foul names and curses. \\'I gave him better than I got, but he \\nknifed me, the dung, before I throttled him. You must go, or I\\'ll eat you. \\n\\nNews must get through to Lugb(r)rz, or we\\'ll both be for the Black Pits. Yes, \\nyou too. You won\\'t escape by skulking here.\\' \\n\\nTm not going down those stairs again,\\' growled Snaga, \\'be you captain \\nor no. Nar! Keep your hands off your knife, or I\\'ll put an arrow in your \\nguts. You won\\'t be a captain long when They hear about all these goings-on. \\nI\\'ve fought for the Tower against those stinking Morgul-rats, but a nice \\nmess you two precious captains have made of things, fighting over the swag.\\' \\n\\n\\'That\\'s enough from you,\\' snarled Shagrat. V I had my orders. It was \\nGorbag started it, trying to pinch that pretty shirt.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, you put his back up, being so high and mighty. And he had more \\nsense than you anyway. He told you more than once that the most dangerous of \\nthese spies was still loose, and you wouldn\\'t listen. And you won\\'t listen \\nnow. Gorbag was right, I tell you. There\\'s a great fighter about, one of \\nthose bloody -handed Elves, or one of the filthy tarksA He\\'s coming here, I \\ntell you. You heard the bell. He\\'s got past the Watchers, and that\\'s tark\\'s \\nwork. He\\'s on the stairs. And until he\\'s off them, I\\'m not going down. Not \\nif you were a Nazgyl, I wouldn\\'t.\\' \\n\\n\\'So that\\'s it, is it?\\' yelled Shagrat. \\'You\\'ll do this, and you\\'ll not \\ndo that? And when he does come, you\\'ll bolt and leave me? No, you won\\'t! \\nI\\'ll put red maggot-holes in your belly first.\\' \\n\\nOut of the turret-door the smaller ore came flying. Behind him came \\nShagrat, a large ore with long arms that, as he ran crouching, reached to \\nthe ground. But one arm hung limp and seemed to be bleeding; the other \\nhugged a large black bundle. In the red glare Sam, cowering behind the \\nstair-door, caught a glimpse of his evil face as it passed: it was scored as \\nif by rending claws and smeared with blood; slaver dripped from its \\nprotruding fangs; the mouth snarled like an animal. \\n\\nAs far as Sam could see, Shagrat hunted Snaga round the roof, until \\nducking and eluding him the smaller ore with a yelp darted back into the \\nturret and disappeared. Then Shagrat halted. Out of the eastward door Sam \\ncould see him now by the parapet, panting, his left claw clenching and \\nunclenching feebly. He put the bundle on the floor and with his right claw \\ndrew out a long red knife and spat on it. Going to the parapet he leaned \\nover, looking down into the outer court far below. Twice he shouted but no \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nanswer came. \\n\\nSuddenly, as Shagrat was stooped over the battlement, his back to the \\nroof-top, Sam to his amazement saw that one of the sprawling bodies was \\nmoving. It was crawling. It put out a claw and clutched the bundle. It \\nstaggered up. In its other hand it held a broad-headed spear with a short \\nbroken haft. It was poised for a stabbing thrust. But at that very moment a \\nhiss escaped its teeth, a gasp of pain or hate. Quick as a snake Shagrat \\nslipped aside, twisted round, and drove his knife into his enemy\\'s throat. \\n\\n\\'Got you, Gorbag!\\' he cried. \\'Not quite dead, eh? Well, I\\'ll finish my \\njob now.\\' He sprang on to the fallen body, and stamped and trampled it in \\nhis fury, stooping now and again to stab and slash it with his knife. \\n\\nSatisfied at last, he threw back his head and let out a horrible gurgling \\nyell of triumph. Then he licked his knife, and put it between his teeth, and \\ncatching up the bundle he came loping towards the near door of the stairs. \\n\\nSam had no time to think. He might have slipped out of the other door, \\nbut hardly without being seen; and he could not have played hide-and-seek \\nwith this hideous ore for long. He did what was probably the best thing he \\ncould have done. He sprang out to meet Shagrat with a shout. He was no \\nlonger holding the Ring, but it was there, a hidden power, a cowing menace \\nto the slaves of Mordor; and in his hand was Sting, and its light smote the \\neyes of the ore like the glitter of cruel stars in the terrible \\nelf-countries, the dream of which was a cold fear to all his kind. And \\nShagrat could not both fight and keep hold of his treasure. He stopped, \\ngrowling, baring his fangs. Then once more, ore-fashion, he leapt aside, and \\nas Sam sprang at him, using the heavy bundle as both shield and weapon, he \\nthrust it hard into his enemy\\'s face. Sam staggered, and before he could \\nrecover, Shagrat darted past and down the stairs. \\n\\nSam ran after him, cursing, but he did not go far. Soon the thought of \\nFrodo returned to him, and he remembered that the other ore had gone back \\ninto the turret. Here was another dreadful choice, and he had no time to \\nponder it. If Shagrat got away, he would soon get help and come back. But if \\nSam pursued him, the other ore might do some horrible deed up there. And \\nanyway Sam might miss Shagrat or be killed by him. He turned quickly and ran \\nback up the stairs. \\'Wrong again, I expect,\\' he sighed. \\'But it\\'s my job to \\ngo right up to the top first, whatever happens afterwards.\\' \\n\\nAway below Shagrat went leaping down the stairs and out over the court \\nand through the gate, bearing his precious burden. If Sam could have seen \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhim and known the grief that his escape would bring, he might have quailed. \\nBut now his mind was set on the last stage of his search. He came cautiously \\nto the turret-door and stepped inside. It opened into darkness. But soon his \\nstaring eyes were aware of a dim light at his right hand. It came from an \\nopening that led to another stairway, dark and narrow: it appeared to go \\nwinding up the turret along the inside of its round outer wall. A torch was \\nglimmering from somewhere up above. \\n\\nSoftly Sam began to climb. He came to the guttering torch, fixed above \\na door on his left that faced a window-slit looking out westward: one of the \\nred eyes that he and Frodo had seen from down below by the tunnel\\'s mouth. \\nQuickly Sam passed the door and hurried on to the second storey, dreading at \\nany moment to he attacked and to feel throttling fingers seize his throat \\nfrom behind. He came next to a window looking east and another torch above \\nthe door to a passage through the middle of the turret. The door was open, \\nthe passage dark save for the glimmer of the torch and the red glare from \\noutside filtering through the window-slit. But here the stair stopped and \\nclimbed no further. Sam crept into the passage. On either side there was a \\nlow door; both were closed and locked. There was no sound at all. \\n\\n\\'A dead end,\\' muttered Sam; \\'and after all my climb! This can\\'t be the \\ntop of the tower. But what can I do now?\\' \\n\\nHe ran back to the lower storey and tried the door. It would not move. \\n\\nHe ran up again, and sweat began to trickle down his face. He felt that even \\nminutes were precious, but one by one they escaped; and he could do nothing. \\nHe cared no longer for Shagrat or Snaga or any other ore that was ever \\nspawned. He longed only for his master, for one sight of his face or one \\ntouch of his hand. \\n\\nAt last, weary and feeling finally defeated, he sat on a step below the \\nlevel of the passage-floor and bowed his head into his hands. It was quiet, \\nhorribly quiet. The torch, that was already burning low when he arrived, \\nsputtered and went out; and he felt the darkness cover him like a tide. And \\nthen softly, to his own surprise, there at the vain end of his long journey \\nand his grief, moved by what thought in his heart he could not tell, Sam \\nbegan to sing. \\n\\nHis voice sounded thin and quavering in the cold dark tower: the voice \\nof a forlorn and weary hobbit that no listening ore could possibly mistake \\nfor the clear song of an Elven-lord. He murmured old childish tunes out of \\nthe Shire, and snatches of Mr. Bilbo\\'s rhymes that came into his mind like \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfleeting glimpses of the country of his home. And then suddenly new strength \\nrose in him, and his voice rang out, while words of his own came unbidden to \\nfit the simple tune. \\n\\nIn western lands beneath the Sun \\nthe flowers may rise in Spring, \\nthe trees may bud, the waters run, \\nthe merry finches sing. \\n\\nOr there maybe \\'tis cloudless night \\nand swaying beeches bear \\nthe Elven-stars as jewels white \\namid their branching hair. \\n\\nThough here at journey\\'s end I lie \\nin darkness buried deep, \\nbeyond all towers strong and high, \\nbeyond all mountains steep, \\nabove all shadows rides the Sun \\nand Stars for ever dwell: \\n\\nI will not say the Day is done, \\nnor bid the Stars farewell. \\n\\n\\'Beyond all towers strong and high,\\' he began again, and then he \\nstopped short. He thought that he had heard a faint voice answering him. But \\nnow he could hear nothing. Yes, he could hear something, but not a voice. \\nFootsteps were approaching. Now a door was being opened quietly in the \\npassage above; the hinges creaked. Sam crouched down listening. The door \\nclosed with a dull thud; and then a snarling ore-voice rang out. \\n\\n\\'Ho la! You up there, you dunghill rat! Stop your squeaking, or I\\'ll \\ncome and deal with you. D\\'you hear?\\' \\n\\nThere was no answer. \\n\\n\\'All right,\\' growled Snaga. \\'But I\\'ll come and have a look at you all \\nthe same, and see what you\\'re up to.\\' \\n\\nThe hinges creaked again, and Sam, now peering over the corner of the \\npassage-threshold, saw a flicker of light in an open doorway, and the dim \\nshape of an ore coming out. He seemed to be carrying a ladder. Suddenly the \\nanswer dawned on Sam: the topmost chamber was reached by a trap-door in \\nthe \\n\\nroof of the passage. Snaga thrust the ladder upwards, steadied it, and then \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nclambered out of sight. Sam heard a bolt drawn back. Then he heard the \\nhideous voice speaking again. \\n\\n\\'You lie quiet, or you\\'ll pay for it! You\\'ve not got long to live in \\npeace, I guess; but if you don\\'t want the fun to begin right now, keep your \\ntrap shut, see? There\\'s a reminder for you!\\' There was a sound like the \\ncrack of a whip. \\n\\nAt that rage blazed in Sam\\'s heart to a sudden fury. He sprang up, ran, \\nand went up the ladder like a cat. His head came out in the middle of the \\nfloor of a large round chamber. A red lamp hung from its roof; the westward \\nwindow-slit was high and dark. Something was lying on the floor by the wall \\nunder the window, but over it a black ore-shape was straddled. It raised a \\nwhip a second time, but the blow never fell. \\n\\nWith a cry Sam leapt across the floor, Sting in hand. The ore wheeled \\nround, but before it could make a move Sam slashed its whip-hand from its \\narm. Howling with pain and fear but desperate the ore charged head-down at \\nhim. Sam\\'s next blow went wide, and thrown off his balance he fell \\nbackwards, clutching at the ore as it stumbled over him. Before he could \\nscramble up he heard a cry and a thud. The ore in its wild haste had tripped \\non the ladder -head and fallen through the open trap-door. Sam gave no more \\nthought to it. He ran to the figure huddled on the floor. It was Frodo. \\n\\nHe was naked, lying as if in a swoon on a heap of filthy rags: his arm \\nwas flung up, shielding his head, and across his side there ran an ugly \\nwhip-weal. \\n\\n\\'Frodo! Mr. Frodo, my dear!\\' cried Sam, tears almost blinding him. \\n\\n\\'It\\'s Sam, I\\'ve come!\\' He half lifted his master and hugged him to his \\nbreast. Frodo opened his eyes. \\n\\n\\'Am I still dreaming?\\' he muttered. \\'But the other dreams were \\nhorrible.\\' \\n\\n\\'You\\'re not dreaming at all, Master,\\' said Sam. \\'It\\'s real. It\\'s me. \\n\\nI\\'ve come.\\' \\n\\n\\'I can hardly believe it,\\' said Frodo, clutching him. \\'There was an ore \\nwith a whip, and then it turns into Sam! Then I wasn\\'t dreaming after all \\nwhen I heard that singing down below, and I tried to answer? Was it you?\\' \\n\\n\\'It was indeed, Mr. Frodo. I\\'d given up hope, almost. I couldn\\'t find \\nyou. \\n\\nWell, you have now, Sam, dear Sam, said Frodo, and he la back in Sam\\'s \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngentle arms, closing his eyes, like a child at rest when night-fears are \\ndriven away by some loved voice or hand. \\n\\nSam felt that he could sit like that in endless happiness; but it was \\nnot allowed. It was not enough for him to find his master, he had still to \\ntry and save him. He kissed Frodo\\'s forehead. \\'Come! Wake up Mr. Frodo!\\' he \\nsaid, trying to sound as cheerful as he had when he drew back the curtains \\nat Bag End on a summer\\'s morning. \\n\\nFrodo sighed and sat up. \\'Where are we? How did I get here?\\' he asked. \\n\\n\\'There\\'s no time for tales till we get somewhere else, Mr. Frodo,\\' said \\nSam. \\'But you\\'re in the top of that tower you and me saw from away down by \\nthe tunnel before the ores got you. How long ago that was I don\\'t know. More \\nthan a day, I guess.\\' \\n\\n\\'Only that?\\' said Frodo. \\'It seems weeks. You must tell me all about \\nit, if we get a chance. Something hit me, didn\\'t it? And I fell into \\ndarkness and foul dreams, and woke and found that waking was worse. Ores \\nwere all round me. I think they had just been pouring some horrible burning \\ndrink down my throat. My head grew clear, but I was aching and weary. They \\nstripped me of everything; and then two great brutes came and questioned me, \\nquestioned me until I thought I should go mad, standing over me, gloating, \\nfingering their knives. I\\'ll never forget their claws and eyes.\\' \\n\\n\\'You won\\'t, if you talk about them, Mr. Frodo,\\' said Sam. \\'And if we \\ndon\\'t want to see them again, the sooner we get going the better. Can you \\nwalk?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, I can walk,\\' said Frodo, getting up slowly. \\'I am not hurt Sam. \\n\\nOnly I feel very tired, and I\\'ve a pain here.\\' He put his hand to the back \\nof his neck above his left shoulder. He stood up, and it looked to Sam as if \\nhe was clothed in flame: his naked skin was scarlet in the light of the lamp \\nabove. Twice he paced across the floor. \\n\\n\\'That\\'s better!\\' he said, his spirits rising a little. \\'I didn\\'t dare \\nto move when I was left alone, or one of the guards came. Until the yelling \\nand fighting began. The two big brutes: they quarrelled, I think. Over me \\nand my things. I lay here terrified. And then all went deadly quiet, and \\nthat was worse.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, they quarrelled, seemingly,\\' said Sam. (There must have been a \\ncouple of hundred of the dirty creatures in this place. A bit of a tall \\norder for Sam Gamgee, as you might say. But they\\'ve done all the killing of \\nthemselves. That\\'s lucky, but it\\'s too long to make a song about, till we\\'re \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nout of here. Now what\\'s to be done? You can\\'t go walking in the Black Land \\nin naught but your skin, Mr. Frodo.\\' \\n\\n\\'They\\'ve taken everything, Sam,\\' said Frodo. \\'Everything I had. Do you \\nunderstand? Everything!\\' Fie cowered on the floor again with bowed head, as \\nhis own words brought home to him the fullness of the disaster, and despair \\noverwhelmed him. \\'The quest has failed Sam. Even if we get out of here, we \\ncan\\'t escape. Only Elves can escape. Away, away out of Middle-earth, far \\naway over the Sea. If even that is wide enough to keep the Shadow out.\\' \\n\\n\\'No, not everything, Mr. Frodo. And it hasn\\'t failed, not yet. I took \\nit, Mr. Frodo, begging your pardon. And I\\'ve kept it safe. It\\'s round my \\nneck now, and a terrible burden it is, too.\\' Sam fumbled for the Ring and \\nits chain. \\'But I suppose you must take it back.\\' Now it had come to it, Sam \\nfelt reluctant to give up the Ring and burden his master with it again. \\n\\n\\'You\\'ve got it?\\' gasped Frodo. \\'You\\'ve got it here? Sam, you\\'re a \\nmarvel!\\' Then quickly and strangely his tone changed. \\'Give it to me!\\' he \\ncried, standing up, holding out a trembling hand. \\'Give it me at once! You \\ncan\\'t have it!\\' \\n\\n\\'All right, Mr. Frodo,\\' said Sam, rather startled. \\'Here it is!\\' Slowly \\nhe drew the Ring out and passed the chain over his head. \\'But you\\'re in the \\nland of Mordor now, sir; and when you get out, you\\'ll see the Fiery Mountain \\nand all. You\\'ll find the Ring very dangerous now, and very hard to bear. If \\nit\\'s too hard a job, I could share it with you, maybe?\\' \\n\\n\\'No, no!\\' cried Frodo, snatching the Ring and chain from Sam\\'s hands. \\n\\n\\'No you won\\'t, you thief!\\' He panted, staring at Sam with eyes wide with \\nfear and enmity. Then suddenly, clasping the Ring in one clenched fist, he \\nstood aghast. A mist seemed to clear from his eyes, and he passed a hand \\nover his aching brow. The hideous vision had seemed so real to him, half \\nbemused as he was still with wound and fear. Sam had changed before his very \\neyes into an ore again, leering and pawing at his treasure, a foul little \\ncreature with greedy eyes and slobbering mouth. But now the vision had \\npassed. There was Sam kneeling before him, his face wrung with pain, as if \\nhe had been stabbed in the heart; tears welled from his eyes. \\n\\n\\'O Sam!\\' cried Frodo. \\'What have I said? What have I done? Forgive me! \\nAfter all you have done. It is the horrible power of the Ring. I wish it had \\nnever, never, been found. But don\\'t mind me, Sam. I must carry the burden to \\nthe end. It can\\'t be altered. You can\\'t come between me and this doom.\\' \\n\\n\\'That\\'s all right, Mr. Frodo,\\' said Sam, rubbing his sleeve across his \\n\\n\\n\\n\\neyes. \\'I understand. But I can still help, can\\'t I? I\\'ve got to get you out \\nof here. At once, see! But first you want some clothes and gear and then \\nsome food. The clothes will be the easiest part. As we\\'re in Mordor, we\\'d, \\nbest dress up Mordor -fashion; and anyway there isn\\'t no choice. It\\'ll have \\nto be ore-stuff for you, Mr. Frodo, I\\'m afraid. And for me too. If we go \\ntogether, we\\'d best match. Now put this round you!\\' \\n\\nSam unclasped his grey cloak and cast it about Frodo\\'s shoulders. Then \\nunslinging his pack he laid it on the floor. He drew Sting from its sheath. \\nHardly a flicker was to be seen upon its blade. \\'I was forgetting this, Mr. \\nFrodo,\\' he said. \\'No, they didn\\'t get everything! You lent me Sting, if you \\nremember, and the Lady\\'s glass. I\\'ve got them both still. But lend them to \\nme a little longer, Mr. Frodo. I must go and see what I can find. You stay \\nhere. Walk about a bit and ease your legs. I shan\\'t be long. I shan\\'t have \\nto go far.\\' \\n\\n\\'Take care, Sam!\\' said Frodo. \\'And be quick! There may be ores still \\nalive, lurking in wait.\\' \\n\\n\\'I\\'ve got to chance it,\\' said Sam. He stepped to the trap-door and \\nslipped down the ladder. In a minute his head reappeared. He threw a long \\nknife on the floor. \\n\\n\\'There\\'s something that might be useful,\\' he said. \\'He\\'s dead: the one \\nthat whipped you. Broke his neck, it seems, in his hurry. Now you draw up \\nthe ladder, if you can, Mr. Frodo; and don\\'t you let it down till you hear \\nme call the password. Elbereth I\\'ll call. What the Elves say. No ore would \\nsay that.\\' \\n\\nFrodo sat for a while and shivered, dreadful fears chasing one another \\nthrough his mind. Then he got up, drew the grey elven-cloak about him, and \\nto keep his mind occupied, began to walk to and fro, prying and peering into \\nevery corner of his prison. \\n\\nIt was not very long, though fear made it seem an hour at least, before \\nhe heard Sam\\'s voice calling softly from below: Elbereth, Elbereth. Frodo \\nlet down the light ladder. Up came Sam, puffing, heaving a great bundle on \\nhis head. He let it fall with a thud. \\n\\n\\'Quick now. Mr. Frodo!\\' he said. \\'I\\'ve had a bit of a search to find \\nanything small enough for the likes of us. We\\'ll have to make do. But we \\nmust hurry. I\\'ve met nothing alive, and I\\'ve seen nothing but I\\'m not easy. \\n\\nI think this place is being watched. I can\\'t explain it, but well: it feels \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nto me as if one of those foul flying Riders was about, up in the blackness \\nwhere he can\\'t be seen.\\' \\n\\nHe opened the bundle. Frodo looked in disgust at the contents, but \\nthere was nothing for it: he had to put the things on, or go naked. There \\nwere long hairy breeches of some unclean beast-fell, and a tunic of dirty \\nleather. He drew them on. Over the tunic went a coat of stout ring-mail, \\nshort for a full-sized ore, too long for Frodo and heavy. About it he \\nclasped a belt, at which there hung a short sheath holding a broad-bladed \\nstabbing-sword. Sam had brought several ore-helmets. One of them fitted \\nFrodo well enough, a black cap with iron rim, and iron hoops covered with \\nleather upon which the evil Eye was painted in red above the beaklike \\nnose-guard. \\n\\n\\'The Morgul-stuff, Gorbag\\'s gear, was a better fit and better made,\\' \\nsaid Sam; \\'but it wouldn\\'t do, I guess, to go carrying his tokens into \\nMordor, not after this business here. Well, there you are, Mr. Frodo. A \\nperfect little ore, if I may make so bold-at least you would be, if we could \\ncover your face with a mask, give you longer arms, and make you bow-legged. \\nThis will hide some of the tell-tales.\\' He put a large black cloak round \\nFrodo\\'s shoulders. \\'Now you\\'re ready! You can pick up a shield as we go.\\' \\n\\n\\'What about you, Sam?\\' said Frodo. \\'Aren\\'t we going to match?\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, Mr. Frodo, I\\'ve been thinking,\\' said Sam. \\'I\\'d best not leave \\nany of my stuff behind, and we can\\'t destroy it. And I can\\'t wear ore-mail \\nover all my clothes, can I? I\\'ll just have to cover up.\\' \\n\\nHe knelt down and carefully folded his elven-cloak. It went into a \\nsurprisingly small roll. This he put into his pack that lay on the floor. \\n\\nStanding up, he slung it behind his back, put an ore-helm on his head, and \\ncast another black cloak about his shoulders. \\'There!\\' he said. \\'Now we \\nmatch, near enough. And now we must be off!\\' \\n\\n\\'I can\\'t go all the way at a run, Sam,\\' said Frodo with a wry smile. \\'I \\nhope you\\'ve made inquiries about inns along the road? Or have you forgotten \\nabout food and drink?\\' \\n\\n\\'Save me, but so I had!\\' said Sam. He whistled in dismay. \\'Bless me, \\n\\nMr. Frodo, but you\\'ve gone and made me that hungry and thirsty! I don\\'t know \\nwhen drop or morsel last passed my lips. I\\'d forgotten it, trying to find \\nyou. But let me think! Last time I looked I\\'d got about enough of that \\nwaybread, and of what Captain Faramir gave us, to keep me on my legs for a \\ncouple of weeks at a pinch. But if there\\'s a drop left in my bottle, there\\'s \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nno more. That\\'s not going to be enough for two, nohow. Don\\'t ores eat, and \\ndon\\'t they drink? Or do they just live on foul air and poison?\\' \\n\\n\\'No, they eat and drink, Sam. The Shadow that bred them can only mock, \\nit cannot make: not real new things of its own. I don\\'t think it gave life \\nto the ores, it only ruined them and twisted them; and if they are to live \\nat all, they have to live like other living creatures. Foul waters and foul \\nmeats they\\'ll take, if they can get no better, but not poison. They\\'ve fed \\nme, and so I\\'m better off than you. There must be food and water somewhere \\nin this place.\\' \\'But there\\'s no time to look for them,\\' said Sam. \\n\\n\\'Well, things are a bit better than you think,\\' said Frodo. \\'I have had \\na bit of luck while you were away. Indeed they did not take everything. I\\'ve \\nfound my food-bag among some rags on the floor. They\\'ve rummaged it, of \\ncourse. But I guess they disliked the very look and smell of the lembas, \\nworse than Gollum did. It\\'s scattered about and some of it is trampled and \\nbroken, but I\\'ve gathered it together. It\\'s not far short of what you\\'ve \\ngot. But they\\'ve taken Faramir\\'s food, and they\\'ve slashed up my \\nwater-bottle.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, there\\'s no more to be said,\\' said Sam. \\'We\\'ve got enough to \\nstart on. But the water\\'s going to be a bad business. But come Mr. Frodo! \\n\\nOff we go, or a whole lake of it won\\'t do us any good!\\' \\n\\n\\'Not till you\\'ve had a mouthful, Sam,\\' said Frodo. \\'I won\\'t budge. \\n\\nHere, take this elven-cake, and drink that last drop in your bottle! The \\nwhole thing is quite hopeless, so it\\'s no good worrying about tomorrow. It \\nprobably won\\'t come.\\' \\n\\nAt last they started. Down the ladder they climbed, and then Sam took \\nit and laid it in the passage beside the huddled body of the fallen ore. The \\nstair was dark, but on the roof-top the glare of the Mountain could still be \\nseen, though it was dying down now to a sullen red. They picked up two \\nshields to complete their disguise and then went on. \\n\\nDown the great stairway they plodded. The high chamber of the turret \\nbehind, where they had met again, seemed almost homely: they were out in the \\nopen again now, and terror ran along the walls. All might be dead in the \\nTower of Cirith Ungol, but it was steeped in fear and evil still. \\n\\nAt length they came to the door upon the outer court, and they halted. \\n\\nEven from where they stood they felt the malice of the Watchers beating on \\nthem, black silent shapes on either side of the gate through which the glare \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nof Mordor dimly showed. As they threaded their way among the hideous \\nbodies \\n\\nof the ores each step became more difficult. Before they even reached the \\narchway they were brought to a stand. To move an inch further was a pain and \\nweariness to will and limb. \\n\\nFrodo had no strength for such a battle. He sank to the ground. \\'I \\ncan\\'t go on, Sam,\\' he murmured. v I\\'m going to faint. I don\\'t know what\\'s \\ncome over me.\\' \\n\\nV I do, Mr. Frodo. Hold up now! It\\'s the gate. There\\'s some devilry \\nthere. But I got through, and I\\'m going to get out. It can\\'t be more \\ndangerous than before. Now for it!\\' \\n\\nSam drew out the elven-glass of Galadriel again. As if to do honour to \\nhis hardihood, and to grace with splendour his faithful brown hobbit-hand \\nthat had done such deeds, the phial blazed forth suddenly, so that all the \\nshadowy court was lit with a dazzling radiance like lightning; but it \\nremained steady and did not pass. \\n\\n\\'Gilthoniel, A Elbereth!\\' Sam cried. For, why he did not know, his \\nthought sprang back suddenly to the Elves in the Shire, and the song that \\ndrove away the Black Rider in the trees. \\n\\nAiya elenion ancalima!\\' cried Frodo once again behind him. \\n\\nThe will of the Watchers was broken with a suddenness like the snapping \\nof a cord, and Frodo and Sam stumbled forward. Then they ran. Through the \\ngate and past the great seated figures with their glittering eyes. There was \\na crack. The keystone of the arch crashed almost on their heels, and the \\nwall above crumbled, and fell in ruin. Only by a hair did they escape. A \\nbell clanged; and from the Watchers there went up a high and dreadful wail. \\nFar up above in the darkness it was answered. Out of the black sky there \\ncame dropping like a bolt a winged shape, rending the clouds with a ghastly \\nshriek. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 2 . The Land of Shadow \\n\\n\\n\\nSam had just wits enough left to thrust the phial back into his breast. \\n\\n\\'Run, Mr. Frodo!\\' he cried. \\'No, not that way! There\\'s a sheer drop over the \\nwall. Follow me!\\' \\n\\nDown the road from the gate they fled. In fifty paces, with a swift \\nbend round a jutting bastion of the cliff, it took them out of sight from \\nthe Tower. They had escaped for the moment. Cowering back against the rock \\nthey drew breath, and then they clutched at their hearts. Perching now on \\nthe wall beside the ruined gate the Nazgyl sent out its deadly cries. All \\nthe cliffs echoed. \\n\\nIn terror they stumbled on. Soon the road bent sharply eastward again \\nand exposed them for a dreadful moment to view from the Tower. As they \\nflitted across they glanced back and saw the great black shape upon the \\nbattlement; then they plunged down between high rock-walls in a cutting that \\nfell steeply to join the Morgul-road. They came to the way-meeting. There \\nwas still no sign of ores, nor of an answer to the cry of the Nazgyl; but \\nthey knew that the silence would not last long. At any moment now the hunt \\nwould begin. \\n\\n\\'This won\\'t do, Sam,\\' said Frodo. \\'If we were real ores, we ought to be \\ndashing back to the Tower, not running away. The first enemy we meet will \\nknow us. We must get off this road somehow.\\' \\n\\n\\'But we can\\'t,\\' said Sam, \\'not without wings.\\' \\n\\nThe eastern faces of the Ephel D(r)ath were sheer, falling in cliff and \\nprecipice to the black trough that lay between them and the inner ridge. A \\nshort way beyond the way-meeting, after another steep incline, a flying \\nbridge of stone leapt over the chasm and bore the road across into the \\ntumbled slopes and glens of the Morgai. With a desperate spurt Frodo and Sam \\ndashed along the bridge; but they had hardly reached its further end when \\nthey heard the hue and cry begin. Away behind them, now high above on the \\nmountain- side, loomed the Tower of Cirith Ungol, its stones glowing dully. \\nSuddenly its harsh bell clanged again, and then broke into a shattering \\npeal. Horns sounded. And now from beyond the bridge-end came \\nanswering \\n\\ncries. Down in the dark trough, cut off from the dying glare of Orodruin, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrodo and Sam could not see ahead, but already they heard the tramp of \\niron-shod feet, and upon the road there rang the swift clatter of hoofs. \\n\\n\\'Quick, Sam! Over we go!\\' cried Frodo. They scrambled onto the low \\nparapet of the bridge. Fortunately there was no longer any dreadful drop \\ninto the gulf, for the slopes of the Morgai had already risen almost to the \\nlevel of the road; but it was too dark for them to guess the depth of the \\nfall. \\n\\n\\'Well, here goes, Mr. Frodo,\\' said Sam. \\'Good-bye!\\' \\n\\nFie let go. Frodo followed. And even as they fell they heard the rush of \\nhorsemen sweeping over the bridge and the rattle of orc-feet running up \\nbehind. But Sam would have laughed, if he had dared. Half fearing a breaking \\nplunge down on to unseen rocks the hobbits landed, in a drop of no more than \\na dozen feet, with a thud and a crunch into the last thing that they had \\nexpected: a tangle of thorny bushes. There Sam lay still, softly sucking a \\nscratched hand. \\n\\nWhen the sound of hoof and foot had passed he ventured a whisper. \\n\\'Bless me, Mr. Frodo, but I didn\\'t know as anything grew in Mordor! But if I \\nhad a\\'known, this is just what I\\'d have looked for. These thorns must be a \\nfoot long by the feel of them; they\\'ve stuck through everything I\\'ve got on. \\nWish I\\'d a\\'put that mail-shirt on!\\' \\n\\n\\'Ore-mail doesn\\'t keep these thorns out,\\' said Frodo. \\'Not even a \\nleather jerkin is any good.\\' \\n\\nThey had a struggle to get out of the thicket. The thorns and briars \\nwere as tough as wire and as clinging as claws. Their cloaks were rent and \\ntattered before they broke free at last. \\n\\n\\'Now down we go, Sam,\\' Frodo whispered. \\'Down into the valley quick, \\nand then turn northward, as soon as ever we can.\\' \\n\\nDay was coming again in the world outside, and far beyond the glooms of \\nMordor the Sun was climbing over the eastern rim of Middle-earth; but here \\nall was still dark as night. The Mountain smouldered and its fires went out. \\nThe glare faded from the cliffs. The easterly wind that had been blowing \\never since they left Ithilien now seemed dead. Slowly and painfully they \\nclambered down, groping, stumbling, scrambling among rock and briar and \\ndead \\n\\nwood in the blind shadows, down and down until they could go no further. \\n\\nAt length they stopped, and sat side by side, their backs against a \\nboulder. Both were sweating. \\'If Shagrat himself was to offer me a glass of \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwater, I\\'d shake his hand,\\' said Sam. \\n\\n\\'Don\\'t say such things!\\' said Frodo. \\'It only makes it worse.\\' Then he \\nstretched himself out, dizzy and weary, and he spoke no more for a while. At \\nlast with a struggle he got up again. To his amazement he found that Sam was \\nasleep. \\'Wake up, Sam!\\' he said. \\'Come on! It\\'s time we made another \\neffort.\\' \\n\\nSam scrambled to his feet. \\'Weill never!\\' he said. \\'I must have \\ndropped off. It\\'s a long time, Mr. Frodo, since I had a proper sleep, and my \\neyes just closed down on their own.\\' \\n\\nFrodo now led the way, northward as near as he could guess, among the \\nstones and boulders lying thick at the bottom of the great ravine. But \\npresently he stopped again. \\n\\n\\'It\\'s no good, Sam,\\' he said. \\'I can\\'t manage it. This mail-shirt, I \\nmean. Not in my present state. Even my mithril-coat seemed heavy when I was \\ntired. This is far heavier. And what\\'s the use of it? We shan\\'t win through \\nby fighting.\\' \\n\\n\\'But we may have some to do,\\' said Sam. \\'And there\\'s knives and stray \\narrows. That Gollum isn\\'t dead, for one thing. I don\\'t like to think of you \\nwith naught but a bit of leather between you and a stab in the dark.\\' \\n\\n\\'Look here, Sam dear lad,\\' said Frodo: \\'I am tired, weary, I haven\\'t a \\nhope left. But I have to go on trying to get to the Mountain, as long as I \\ncan move. The Ring is enough. This extra weight is killing me. It must go. \\n\\nBut don\\'t think I\\'m ungrateful. I hate to think of the foul work you must \\nhave had among the bodies to find it for me.\\' \\n\\n\\'Don\\'t talk about it, Mr. Frodo. Bless you! I\\'d carry you on my back, \\nif I could. Let it go then!\\' \\n\\nFrodo laid aside his cloak and took off the ore-mail and flung it away. \\n\\nHe shivered a little. \\'What I really need is something warm,\\' he said. \\'It\\'s \\ngone cold, or else I\\'ve caught a chill.\\' \\n\\n\\'You can have my cloak, Mr. Frodo,\\' said Sam. He unslung his pack and \\ntook out the elven-cloak. \\'How\\'s this, Mr. Frodo?\\' he said. \\'You wrap that \\nore-rag close round you, and put the belt outside it. Then this can go over \\nall. It don\\'t look quite ore-fashion, but it\\'ll keep you warmer; and I \\ndaresay it\\'ll keep you from harm better than any other gear. It was made by \\nthe Lady.\\' \\n\\nFrodo took the cloak and fastened the brooch. \\'That\\'s better!\\' he said. \\n\\n\\'I feel much lighter. I can go on now. But this blind dark seems to be \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngetting into my heart. As I lay in prison, Sam. I tried to remember the \\nBrandywine, and Woody End, and The Water running through the mill at \\nHobbiton. But I can\\'t see them now.\\' \\n\\nThere now, Mr. Frodo, it\\'s you that\\'s talking of water this time!\\' \\nsaid Sam. \\'If only the Lady could see us or hear us, I\\'d say to her: (Your \\nLadyship, all we want is light and water: just clean water and plain \\ndaylight, better than any jewels, begging your pardon.( But it\\'s a long way \\nto Lurien.\\' Sam sighed and waved his hand towards the heights of the Ephel \\nD(r)ath, now only to be guessed as a deeper blackness against the black sky. \\n\\nThey started off again. They had not gone far when Frodo paused. \\n\\'There\\'s a Black Rider over us,\\' he said. \\'I can feel it. We had better keep \\nstill for a while.\\' \\n\\nCrouched under a great boulder they sat facing back westward and did \\nnot speak for some time. Then Frodo breathed a sigh of relief. \\'It\\'s \\npassed,\\' he said. They stood up, and then they both stared in wonder. Away \\nto their left, southward, against a sky that was turning grey, the peaks and \\nhigh ridges of the great range began to appear dark and black, visible \\nshapes. Light was growing behind them. Slowly it crept towards the North. \\nThere was battle far above in the high spaces of the air. The billowing \\nclouds of Mordor were being driven back, their edges tattering as a wind out \\nof the living world came up and swept the fumes and smokes towards the dark \\nland of their home. Under the lifting skirts of the dreary canopy dim light \\nleaked into Mordor like pale morning through the grimed window of a prison. \\n\\n\\'Look at it, Mr. Frodo!\\' said Sam. \\'Look at it! The wind\\'s changed. \\nSomething\\'s happening. He\\'s not having it all his own way. His darkness is \\nbreaking up out in the world there. I wish I could see what is going on!\\' \\n\\nIt was the morning of the fifteenth of March, and over the Vale of \\nAnduin the Sun was rising above the eastern shadow, and the south-west wind \\nwas blowing. Thjoden lay dying on the Pelennor Fields. \\n\\nAs Frodo and Sam stood and gazed, the rim of light spread all along the \\nline of the Ephel D(r)ath, and then they saw a shape, moving at a great speed \\nout of the West, at first only a black speck against the glimmering strip \\nabove the mountain-tops, but growing, until it plunged like a bolt into the \\ndark canopy and passed high above them. As it went it sent out a long shrill \\ncry, the voice of a Nazgyl; but this cry no longer held any terror for them: \\nit was a cry of woe and dismay, ill tidings for the Dark Tower. The Lord of \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe Ring-wraiths had met his doom. \\n\\n\\'What did I tell you? Something\\'s happening!\\' cried Sam.\\' (The war\\'s \\ngoing well,( said Shagrat; but Gorbag he wasn\\'t so sure. And he was right \\nthere too. Things are looking up, Mr. Frodo. Haven\\'t you got some hope now?\\' \\n\\n\\'Well no, not much, Sam,\\' Frodo sighed. \\'That\\'s away beyond the \\nmountains. We\\'re going east not west. And I\\'m so tired. And the Ring is so \\nheavy, Sam. And I begin to see it in my mind all the time, like a great \\nwheel of fire.\\' \\n\\nSam\\'s quick spirits sank again at once. He looked at his master \\nanxiously, and he took his hand. \\'Come, Mr. Frodo!\\' he said. \\'I\\'ve got one \\nthing I wanted: a bit of light. Enough to help us, and yet I guess it\\'s \\ndangerous too. Try a bit further, and then we\\'ll lie close and have a rest. \\n\\nBut take a morsel to eat now, a bit of the Elves\\' food; it may hearten you.\\' \\n\\nSharing a wafer of lembas, and munching it as best they could with \\ntheir parched mouths. Frodo and Sam plodded on. The light, though no more \\nthan a grey dusk, was now enough for them to see that they were deep in the \\nvalley between the mountains. It sloped up gently northward, and at its \\nbottom went the bed of a now dry and withered stream. Beyond its stony \\ncourse they saw a beaten path that wound its way under the feet of the \\nwestward cliffs. Had they known, they could have reached it quicker, for it \\nwas a track that left the main Morgul-road at the western bridge-end and \\nwent down by a long stair cut in the rock to the valley\\'s bottom. It was \\nused by patrols or by messengers going swiftly to lesser posts and \\nstrongholds north-away, between Cirith Ungol and the narrows of Isenmouthe, \\nthe iron jaws of Carach Angren. \\n\\nIt was perilous for the hobbits to use such a path, but they needed \\nspeed, and Frodo felt that he could not face the toil of scrambling among \\nthe boulders or in the trackless glens of the Morgai. And he judged that \\nnorthward was, maybe, the way that their hunters would least expect them to \\ntake. The road east to the plain, or the pass back westward, those they \\nwould first search most thoroughly. Only when he was well north of the Tower \\ndid he mean to turn and seek for some way to take him east, east on the last \\ndesperate stage of his journey. So now they crossed the stony bed and took \\nto the ore -path, and for some time they marched along it. The cliffs at \\ntheir left were overhung, and they could not be seen from above; but the \\npath made many bends, and at each bend they gripped their sword-hilts and \\nwent forward cautiously. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe light grew no stronger, for Orodruin was still belching forth a \\ngreat fume that, beaten upwards by the opposing airs, mounted higher and \\nhigher, until it reached a region above the wind and spread in an \\nimmeasurable roof, whose central pillar rose out of the shadows beyond their \\nview. They had trudged for more than an hour when they heard a sound that \\nbrought them to a halt. Unbelievable, but unmistakable. Water trickling. Out \\nof a gully on the left, so sharp and narrow that it looked as if the black \\ncliff had been cloven by some huge axe, water came dripping down: the last \\nremains, maybe, of some sweet rain gathered from sunlit seas, but ill-fated \\nto fall at last upon the walls of the Black Land and wander fruitless down \\ninto the dust. Here it came out of the rock in a little falling streamlet, \\nand flowed across the path, and turning south ran away swiftly to be lost \\namong the dead stones. \\n\\nSam sprang towards it. \\'If ever I see the Lady again, I will tell her!\\' \\nhe cried. \\'Light and now water!\\' Then he stopped. \\'Let me drink first Mr. \\nFrodo,\\' he said. \\n\\n\\'All right, but there\\'s room enough for two.\\' \\n\\n\\'I didn\\'t mean that,\\' said Sam. \\'I mean: if it\\'s poisonous, or \\nsomething that will show its badness quick, well, better me than you, \\nmaster, if you understand me.\\' \\n\\n\\'I do. But I think we\\'ll trust our luck together, Sam; or our blessing. \\n\\nStill, be careful now, if it\\'s very cold!\\' \\n\\nThe water was cool but not icy, and it had an unpleasant taste, at once \\nbitter and oily, or so they would have said at home. Here it seemed beyond \\nall praise, and beyond fear or prudence. They drank their fill, and Sam \\nreplenished his water-bottle. After that Frodo felt easier, and they went on \\nfor several miles, until the broadening of the road and the beginnings of a \\nrough wall along its edge warned them that they were drawing near to another \\nore-hold. \\n\\n\\'This is where we turn aside, Sam,\\' said Frodo. \\'And we must turn \\neast.\\' He sighed as he looked at the gloomy ridges across the valley. \\'I \\nhave just about enough strength left to find some hole away up there. And \\nthen I must rest a little.\\' \\n\\nThe river-bed was now some way below the path. They scrambled down to \\nit, and began to cross it. To their surprise they came upon dark pools fed \\nby threads of water trickling down from some source higher up the valley. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUpon its outer marges under the westward mountains Mordor was a dying \\nland, \\n\\nbut it was not yet dead. And here things still grew, harsh, twisted, bitter, \\nstruggling for life. In the glens of the Morgai on the other side of the \\nvalley low scrubby trees lurked and clung, coarse grey grass-tussocks fought \\nwith the stones, and withered mosses crawled on them; and everywhere great \\nwrithing, tangled brambles sprawled. Some had long stabbing thorns, some \\nhooked barbs that rent like knives. The sullen shrivelled leaves of a past \\nyear hung on them, grating and rattling in the sad airs, but their \\nmaggot-ridden buds were only just opening. Flies, dun or grey, or black, \\nmarked like ores with a red eye-shaped blotch, buzzed and stung; and above \\nthe briar -thickets clouds of hungry midges danced and reeled. \\n\\n\\'Ore -gear\\'s no good,\\' said Sam, waving his arms. \\'I wish I\\'d got an \\nore\\'s hide!\\' \\n\\nAt last Frodo could go no further. They had climbed up a narrow \\nshelving ravine, but they still had a long way to go before they could even \\ncome in sight of the last craggy ridge. \\'I must rest now, Sam, and sleep if \\nI can.\\' said Frodo. He looked about, but there seemed nowhere even for an \\nanimal to crawl into in this dismal country. At length, tired out, they \\nslunk under a curtain of brambles that hung down like a mat over a low \\nrock-face. \\n\\nThere they sat and made such a meal as they could. Keeping back the \\nprecious lembas for the evil days ahead, they ate the half of what remained \\nin Sam\\'s bag of Faramir\\'s provision: some dried fruit, and a small slip of \\ncured meat; and they sipped some water. They had drunk again from the pools \\nin the valley, but they were very, thirsty again. There was a bitter tang in \\nthe air of Mordor that dried the mouth. When Sam thought of water even his \\nhopeful spirit quailed. Beyond the Morgai there was the dreadful plain of \\nGorgoroth to cross. \\n\\n\\'Now you go to sleep first, Mr. Frodo,\\' he said. \\'It\\'s getting dark \\nagain. I reckon this day is nearly over.\\' \\n\\nFrodo sighed and was asleep almost before the words were spoken. Sam \\nstruggled with his own weariness, and he took Frodo\\'s hand; and there he sat \\nsilent till deep night fell. Then at last, to keep himself awake, he crawled \\nfrom the hiding-place and looked out. The land seemed full of creaking and \\ncracking and sly noises, but there was no sound of voice or of foot. Far \\nabove the Ephel D(r)ath in the West the night- sky was still dim and pale. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere, peeping among the cloud-wrack above a dark tor high up in the \\nmountains, Sam saw a white star twinkle for a while. The beauty of it smote \\nhis heart, as he looked up out of the forsaken land, and hope returned to \\nhim. For like a shaft, clear and cold, the thought pierced him that in the \\nend the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high \\nbeauty for ever beyond its reach. His song in the Tower had been defiance \\nrather than hope; for then he was thinking of himself. Now, for a moment, \\nhis own fate, and even his masters, ceased to trouble him. He crawled back \\ninto the brambles and laid himself by Frodo\\'s side, and putting away all \\nfear he cast himself into a deep untroubled sleep. \\n\\nThey woke together, hand in hand. Sam was almost fresh, ready for \\nanother day; but Frodo sighed. His sleep had been uneasy, full of dreams of \\nfire, and waking brought him no comfort. Still his sleep had not been \\nwithout all healing virtue: he was stronger, more able to bear his burden \\none stage further. They did not know the time, nor how long they had slept; \\nbut after a morsel of food and a sip of water they went on up the ravine, \\nuntil it ended in a sharp slope of screes and sliding stones. There the last \\nliving things gave up their struggle; the tops of the Morgai were grassless, \\nbare, jagged, barren as a slate. \\n\\nAfter much wandering and search they found a way that they could climb, \\nand with a last hundred feet of clawing scramble they were up. They came to \\na cleft between two dark crags, and passing through found themselves on the \\nvery edge of the last fence of Mordor. Below them, at the bottom of a fall \\nof some fifteen hundred feet, lay the inner plain stretching away into a \\nformless gloom beyond their sight. The wind of the world blew now from the \\nWest, and the great clouds were lifted high, floating away eastward; but \\nstill only a grey light came to the dreary fields of Gorgoroth. There smokes \\ntrailed on the ground and lurked in hollows, and fumes leaked from fissures \\nin the earth. \\n\\nStill far away, forty miles at least, they saw Mount Doom, its feet \\nfounded in ashen ruin, its huge cone rising to a great height, where its \\nreeking head was swathed in cloud. Its fires were now dimmed, and it stood \\nin smouldering slumber, as threatening and dangerous as a sleeping beast. \\nBehind it there hung a vast shadow, ominous as a thunder-cloud, the veils of \\nBarad-dyr that was reared far way upon a long spur of the Ashen Mountains \\nthrust down from the North. The Dark Power was deep in thought, and the Eye \\nturned inward, pondering tidings of doubt and danger: a bright sword, and a \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstern and kingly face it saw, and for a while it gave little thought to \\nother things; and all its great stronghold, gate on gate, and tower on \\ntower, was wrapped in a brooding gloom. \\n\\nFrodo and Sam gazed out in mingled loathing and wonder on this hateful \\nland. Between them and the smoking mountain, and about it north and south, \\nall seemed ruinous and dead, a desert burned and choked. They wondered \\nhow \\n\\nthe Lord of this realm maintained and fed his slaves and his armies. Yet \\narmies he had. As far as their eyes could reach, along the skirts of the \\nMorgai and away southward, there were camps, some of tents, some ordered \\nlike small towns. One of the largest of these was right below them. Barely a \\nmile out into the plain it clustered like some huge nest of insects, with \\nstraight dreary streets of huts and long low drab buildings. About it the \\nground was busy with folk going to and fro; a wide road ran from it \\nsouth-east to join the Morgul-way, and along it many lines of small black \\nshapes were hurrying. \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t like the look of things at all,\\' said Sam. \\'Pretty hopeless, I \\ncall it - saving that where there\\'s such a lot of folk there must be wells \\nor water, not to mention food. And these are Men not Ores, or my eyes are \\nall wrong.\\' \\n\\nNeither he nor Frodo knew anything of the great slave- worked fields \\naway south in this wide realm, beyond the fumes of the Mountain by the dark \\nsad waters of Lake N(r)rnen; nor of the great roads that ran away east and \\nsouth to tributary lands, from which the soldiers of the Tower brought long \\nwaggon-trains of goods and booty and fresh slaves. Here in the northward \\nregions were the mines and forges, and the musterings of long-planned war; \\nand here the Dark Power, moving its armies like pieces on the board, was \\ngathering them together. Its first moves, the first feelers of its strength, \\nhad been checked upon its western line, southward and northward. For the \\nmoment it withdrew them, and brought up new forces, massing them about \\nCirith Gorgor for an avenging stroke. And if it had also been its purpose to \\ndefend the Mountain against all approach, it could scarcely have done more. \\n\\n\\'Well!\\' Sam went on. \\'Whatever they have to eat and drink, we can\\'t get \\nit. There\\'s no way down that I can see. And we couldn\\'t cross all that open \\ncountry crawling with enemies, even if we did get down.\\' \\n\\n\\'Still we shall have to try,\\' said Frodo. \\'It\\'s no worse than I \\nexpected. I never hoped to get across. I can\\'t see any hope of it now. But \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve still got to do the best I can. At present that is to avoid being \\ncaptured as long as possible. So we must still go northwards, I think, and \\nsee what it is like where the open plain is narrower.\\' \\n\\n\\'I guess what it\\'ll be like,\\' said Sam. \\'Where it\\'s narrower the Ores \\nand Men will just be packed closer. You\\'ll see, Mr. Frodo.\\' \\n\\n\\'I dare say I shall, if we ever get so far,\\' said Frodo and turned \\naway. \\n\\nThey soon found that it was impossible to make their way along the \\ncrest of the Morgai, or anywhere along its higher levels, pathless as they \\nwere and scored with deep ghylls. In the end they were forced to go back \\ndown the ravine that they had climbed and seek for a way along the valley. \\n\\nIt was rough going, for they dared not cross over to the path on the \\nwestward side. After a mile or more they saw, huddled in a hollow at the \\ncliffs foot, the ore-hold that they had guessed was near at hand: a wall \\nand a cluster of stone huts set about the dark mouth of a cave. There was no \\nmovement to be seen, but the hobbits crept by cautiously, keeping as much as \\nthey could to the thorn-brakes that grew thickly at this point along both \\nsides of the old water -course. \\n\\nThey went two or three miles further, and the ore-hold was hidden from \\nsight behind them; but they had hardly begun to breathe more freely again \\nwhen harsh and loud they heard ore- voices. Quickly they slunk out of sight \\nbehind a brown and stunted bush. The voices drew nearer. Presently two ores \\ncame into view. One was clad in ragged brown and was armed with a bow of \\nhorn; it was of a small breed, black -skinned, with wide and snuffling \\nnostrils: evidently a tracker of some kind. The other was a big \\nfighting-ore, like those of Shagrat\\'s company, bearing the token of the Eye. \\n\\nHe also had a bow at his back and carried a short broad-headed spear. As \\nusual they were quarrelling, and being of different breeds they used the \\nCommon Speech after their fashion. \\n\\nHardly twenty paces from where the hobbits lurked the small ore \\nstopped. \\'Nar!\\' it snarled. \\'I\\'m going home.\\' It pointed across the valley \\nto the ore-hold. \\'No good wearing my nose out on stones any more. There\\'s \\nnot a trace left, I say. I\\'ve lost the scent through giving way to you. It \\nwent up into the hills, not along the valley, I tell you.\\' \\n\\n\\'Not much use are you, you little snufflers?\\' said the big ore. \\'I \\nreckon eyes are better than your snotty noses.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then what have you seen with them?\\' snarled the other. \\'Garn! You \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndon\\'t even know what you\\'re looking for.\\' \\n\\n\\'Whose blame\\'s that?\\' said the soldier. \\'Not mine. That comes from \\nHigher Up. First they say it\\'s a great Elf in bright armour, then it\\'s a \\nsort of small dwarf-man, then it must be a pack of rebel Uruk-hai; or maybe \\nit\\'s all the lot together.\\' \\n\\n\\'Ar !\\' said the tracker. \\'They\\'ve lost their heads, that\\'s what it is. \\n\\nAnd some of the bosses are going to lose their skins too, I guess, if what I \\nhear is true: Tower raided and all, and hundreds of your lads done in, and \\nprisoner got away. If that\\'s the way you fighters go on, small wonder \\nthere\\'s bad news from the battles.\\' \\n\\n\\'Who says there\\'s bad news?\\' shouted the soldier. \\n\\n\\'Ar! Who says there isn\\'t?\\' \\n\\n\\'That\\'s cursed rebel-talk, and I\\'ll stick you, if you don\\'t shut it \\ndown, see?\\' \\n\\n\\'All right, all right!\\' said the tracker. \\'I\\'ll say no more and go on \\nthinking. But what\\'s the black sneak got to do with it all? That gobbler \\nwith the flapping hands?\\' \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know. Nothing, maybe. But he\\'s up to no good, nosing around, \\nI\\'ll wager. Curse him! No sooner had he slipped us and run off than word \\ncame he\\'s wanted alive, wanted quick.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, I hope they get him and put him through it,\\' growled the \\ntracker. \\'He messed up the scent back there, pinching that cast-off \\nmail-shirt that he found, and paddling all round the place before I could \\nget there.\\' \\n\\n\\'It saved his life anyhow,\\' said the soldier. \\'Why, before I knew he \\nwas wanted I shot him, as neat as neat, at fifty paces right in the back; \\nbut he ran on.\\' \\n\\n\\'Garn! You missed him,\\' said the tracker. \\'First you shoot wild, then \\nyou run too slow, and then you send for the poor trackers. I\\'ve had enough \\nof you.\\' He loped off. \\n\\n\\'You come back,\\' shouted the soldier, \\'or I\\'ll report you!\\' \\n\\n\\'Who to? Not to your precious Shagrat. He won\\'t be captain any more.\\' \\n\\n\\'I\\'ll give your name and number to the Nazgyl,\\' said the soldier \\nlowering his voice to a hiss. \\'One of them \\' s in charge at the Tower now.\\' \\n\\nThe other halted, and his voice was full of fear and rage. \\'You cursed \\npeaching sneakthief!\\' he yelled. \\'You can\\'t do your job, and you can\\'t even \\nstick by your own folk. Go to your filthy Shriekers, and may they freeze the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nflesh off you! If the enemy doesn\\'t get them first. They\\'ve done in Number \\nOne, I\\'ve heard, and I hope it\\'s true!\\' \\n\\nThe big ore, spear in hand, leapt after him. But the tracker, springing \\nbehind a stone, put an arrow in his eye as he ran up, and he fell with a \\ncrash. The other ran off across the valley and disappeared. \\n\\nFor a while the hobbits sat in silence. At length Sam stirred. \\'Well I \\ncall that neat as neat,\\' he said. \\'If this nice friendliness would spread \\nabout in Mordor, half our trouble would be over.\\' \\n\\n\\'Quietly, Sam,\\' Frodo whispered. \\'There may be others about. We have \\nevidently had a very narrow escape, and the hunt was hotter on our tracks \\nthan we guessed. But that is the spirit of Mordor, Sam; and it has spread to \\nevery corner of it. Ores have always behaved like that, or so all tales say, \\nwhen they are on their own. But you can\\'t get much hope out of it. They hate \\nus far more, altogether and all the time. If those two had seen us, they \\nwould have dropped all their quarrel until we were dead.\\' \\n\\nThere was another long silence. Sam broke it again, but with a whisper \\nthis time. \\'Did you hear what they said about that gobbler , Mr. Frodo? I \\ntold you Gollum wasn\\'t dead yet, didn\\'t I?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, I remember. And I wondered how you knew,\\' said Frodo. \\'Well come \\nnow! I think we had better not move out from here again, until it has gone \\nquite dark. So you shall tell me how you know, and all about what happened. \\nIf you can do it quietly.\\' \\n\\n\\'I\\'ll try,\\' said Sam, \\'but when I think of that Stinker I get so hot 1 \\ncould shout.\\' \\n\\nThere the hobbits sat under the cover of the thorny bush, while the \\ndrear light of Mordor faded slowly into a deep and starless night; and Sam \\nspoke into Frodo\\'s ear all that he could find words for of Gollum\\'s \\ntreacherous attack, the horror of Shelob, and his own adventures with the \\nores. When he had finished, Frodo said nothing but took Sam\\'s hand and \\npressed it. At length he stirred. \\n\\n\\'Well, I suppose we must be going on again,\\' he said. \\'I wonder how \\nlong it will be before we really are caught and all the toiling and the \\nslinking will be over, and in vain.\\' He stood up. \\'It\\'s dark, and we cannot \\nuse the Lady\\'s glass. Keep it safe for me, Sam. I have nowhere to keep it \\nnow, except in my hand, and I shall need both hands in the blind night. But \\nSting I give to you. I have got an ore -blade, but I do not think it will be \\nmy part to strike any blow again.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was difficult and dangerous moving in the night in the pathless \\nland; but slowly and with much stumbling the two hobbits toiled on hour by \\nhour northward along the eastern edge of the stony valley. When a grey light \\ncrept back over the western heights, long after day had opened in the lands \\nbeyond, they went into hiding again and slept a little, turn by turn. In his \\ntimes of waking Sam was busy with thoughts of food. At last when Frodo \\nroused himself and spoke of eating and making ready for yet another effort, \\nhe asked the question that was troubling him most. \\n\\n\\'Begging your pardon, Mr. Frodo,\\' he said, \\'but have you any notion how \\nfar there is still to go?\\' \\n\\n\\'No, not any clear notion, Sam,\\' Frodo answered. \\'In Rivendell before I \\nset out I was shown a map of Mordor that was made before the Enemy came \\nback \\n\\nhere; but I only remember it vaguely. I remember clearest that there was a \\nplace in the north where the western range and the northern range send out \\nspurs that nearly meet. That must be twenty leagues at least from the bridge \\nback by the Tower. It might be a good point at which to cross. But of \\ncourse, if we get there, we shall be further than we were from the Mountain, \\nsixty miles from it, I should think. I guess that we have gone about twelve \\nleagues north from the bridge now. Even if all goes well, I could hardly \\nreach the Mountain in a week. I am afraid, Sam, that the burden will get \\nvery heavy, and I shall go still slower as we get nearer.\\' \\n\\nSam sighed. \\'That\\'s just as I feared,\\' he said. \\'Well, to say nothing \\nof water, we\\'ve got to eat less, Mr. Frodo, or else move a bit quicker, at \\nany rate while we\\'re still in this valley. One more bite and all the food\\'s \\nended, save the Elves\\' waybread.\\' \\n\\n\\'I\\'ll try and be a bit quicker, Sam,\\' said Frodo, drawing a deep \\nbreath. \\'Come on then! Let\\'s start another march!\\' \\n\\nIt was not yet quite dark again. They plodded along, on into the night. \\n\\nThe hours passed in a weary stumbling trudge with a few brief halts. At the \\nfirst hint of grey light under the skirts of the canopy of shadow they hid \\nthemselves again in a dark hollow under an overhanging stone. \\n\\nSlowly the light grew, until it was clearer than it yet had been. A \\nstrong wind from the West was now driving the fumes of Mordor from the \\nupper \\n\\nairs. Before long the hobbits could make out the shape of the land for some \\nmiles about them. The trough between the mountains and the Morgai had \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsteadily dwindled as it climbed upwards, and the inner ridge was now no more \\nthan a shelf in the steep faces of the Ephel D(r)ath; but to the east it fell \\nas sheerly as ever down into Gorgoroth. Ahead the water-course came to an \\nend in broken steps of rock; for out from the main range there sprang a high \\nbarren spur, thrusting eastward like a wall. To meet it there stretched out \\nfrom the grey and misty northern range of Ered Lithui a long jutting arm; \\nand between the ends there was a narrow gap: Carach Angren, the Isenmouthe, \\nbeyond which lay the deep dale of Udyn. In that dale behind the Morannon \\nwere the tunnels and deep armouries that the servants of Mordor had made for \\nthe defence of the Black Gate of their land; and there now their Lord was \\ngathering in haste great forces to meet the onslaught of the Captains of the \\nWest. Upon the out-thrust spurs forts and towers were built, and watch-fires \\nburned; and all across the gap an earth-wall had been raised, and a deep \\ntrench delved that could be crossed only by a single bridge. \\n\\nA few miles north, high up in the angle where the western spur branched \\naway from the main range, stood the old castle of Durthang, now one of the \\nmany ore-holds that clustered about the dale of Udyn. A road, already \\nvisible in the growing light, came winding down from it, until only a mile \\nor two from where the hobbits lay it turned east and ran along a shelf cut \\nin the side of the spur, and so went down into the plain, and on to the \\nIsenmouthe. \\n\\nTo the hobbits as they looked out it seemed that all their journey \\nnorth had been useless. The plain to their right was dim and smoky, and they \\ncould see there neither camps nor troops moving; but all that region was \\nunder the vigilance of the forts of Carach Angren. \\n\\n\\'We have come to a dead end, Sam,\\' said Frodo. \\'If we go on, we shall \\nonly come up to that ore-tower, but the only road to take is that road that \\ncomes down from it - unless we go back. We can\\'t climb up westward, or climb \\ndown eastward.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then we must take the road, Mr. Frodo,\\' said Sam. \\'We must take it and \\nchance our luck, if there is any luck in Mordor. We might as well give \\nourselves up as wander about any more, or try to go back. Our food won\\'t \\nlast. We\\'ve got to make a dash for it!\\' \\n\\n\\'All right, Sam,\\' said Frodo. \\'Lead me! As long as you\\'ve got any hope \\nleft. Mine is gone. But I can\\'t dash, Sam. I\\'ll just plod along after you.\\' \\n\\n\\'Before you start any more plodding, you need sleep and food, Mr. \\n\\nFrodo. Come and take what you can get of them!\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe gave Frodo water and an additional wafer of the waybread, and he \\nmade a pillow of his cloak for his master\\'s head. Frodo was too weary to \\ndebate the matter, and Sam did not tell him that he had drunk the last drop \\nof their water, and eaten Sam\\'s share of the food as well as his own. When \\nFrodo was asleep Sam bent over him and listened to his breathing and scanned \\nhis face. It was lined and thin, and yet in sleep it looked content and \\nunafraid. \\'Well, here goes, Master!\\' Sam muttered to himself. \\'I\\'ll have to \\nleave you for a bit and trust to luck. Water we must have, or we\\'ll get no \\nfurther.\\' \\n\\nSam crept out, and flitting from stone to stone with more than \\nhobbit-care, he went down to the water -course, and then followed it for some \\nway as it climbed north, until he came to the rock-steps where long ago, no \\ndoubt, its spring had come gushing down in a little waterfall. All now \\nseemed dry and silent; but refusing to despair Sam stooped and listened, and \\nto his delight he caught the sound of trickling. Clambering a few steps up \\nhe found a tiny stream of dark water that came out from the hill-side and \\nfilled a little bare pool, from which again it spilled, and vanished then \\nunder the barren stones. \\n\\nSam tasted the water, and it seemed good enough. Then he drank deeply, \\nrefilled the bottle, and turned to go back. At that moment he caught a \\nglimpse of a black form or shadow flitting among the rocks away near Frodo\\'s \\nhiding-place. Biting back a cry, he leapt down from the spring and ran, \\njumping from stone to stone. It was a wary creature, difficult to see, but \\nSam had little doubt about it: he longed to get his hands on its neck. But \\nit heard him coming and slipped quickly away. Sam thought he saw a last \\nfleeting glimpse of it, peering back over the edge of the eastward \\nprecipice, before it ducked and disappeared. \\n\\n\\'Well, luck did not let me down,\\' muttered Sam, \\'but that was a near \\nthing! Isn\\'t it enough to have ores by the thousand without that stinking \\nvillain coming nosing round? I wish he had been shot!\\' He sat down by Frodo \\nand did not rouse him; but he did not dare to go to sleep himself. At last \\nwhen he felt his eyes closing and knew that his struggle to keep awake could \\nnot go on much longer, he wakened Frodo gently. \\n\\n\\'That Gollum\\'s about again, I\\'m afraid, Mr. Frodo,\\' he said. \\n\\'Leastways, if it wasn\\'t him, then there\\'s two of him. I went away to find \\nsome water and spied him nosing round just as I turned back. I reckon it \\nisn\\'t safe for us both to sleep together, and begging your pardon, but I \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncan\\'t hold up my lids much longer.\\' \\n\\n\\'Bless you, Sam!\\' said Frodo. \\'Lie down and take your proper turn! But \\nI\\'d rather have Gollum than ores. At any rate he won\\'t give us away to them \\n- not unless he\\'s caught himself.\\' \\n\\n\\'But he might do a bit of robbery and murder on his own,\\' growled Sam. \\n\\'Keep your eyes open, Mr. Frodo! There\\'s a bottle full of water. Drink up. \\n\\nWe can fill it again when we go on.\\' With that Sam plunged into sleep. \\n\\nLight was fading when he woke. Frodo sat propped against the rock \\nbehind, but he had fallen asleep. The water-bottle was empty. There was no \\nsign of Gollum. \\n\\nMordor-dark had returned, and the watch-fires on the heights burned \\nfierce and red, when the hobbits set out again on the most dangerous stage \\nof all their journey. They went first to the little spring, and then \\nclimbing warily up they came to the road at the point where it swung east \\ntowards the Isenmouthe twenty miles away. It was not a broad road, and it \\nhad no wall or parapet along the edge and as it ran on the sheer drop from \\nits brink became deeper and deeper. The hobbits could hear no movements, and \\nafter listening for a while they set off eastward at a steady pace. \\n\\nAfter doing some twelve miles, they halted. A short way back the road \\nhad bent a little northward and the stretch that they had passed over was \\nnow screened from sight. This proved disastrous. They rested for some \\nminutes and then went on; but they had not taken many steps when suddenly in \\nthe stillness of the night they heard the sound that all along they had \\nsecretly dreaded: the noise of marching feet. It was still some way behind \\nthem, but looking back they could see the twinkle of torches coming round \\nthe bend less than a mile away, and they were moving fast: too fast for \\nFrodo to escape by flight along the road ahead. \\n\\n\\'I feared it, Sam,\\' said Frodo. \\'We\\'ve trusted to luck, and it has \\nfailed us. We\\'re trapped.\\' He looked wildly up at the frowning wall, where \\nthe road-builders of old had cut the rock sheer for many fathoms above their \\nheads. He ran to the other side and looked over the brink into a dark pit of \\ngloom. \\'We\\'re trapped at last!\\' he said He sank to the ground beneath the \\nwall of rock and bowed his head. \\n\\n\\'Seems so,\\' said Sam. \\'Well, we can but wait and see.\\' And with that he \\nsat down beside Frodo under the shadow of the cliff. \\n\\nThey did not have to wait long. The ores were going at a great pace. \\n\\nThose in the foremost files bore torches. On they came, red flames in the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndark, swiftly growing. Now Sam too bowed his head, hoping that it would hide \\nhis face when the torches reached them; and he set their shields before \\ntheir knees to hide their feet. \\n\\n\\'If only they are in a hurry and will let a couple of tired soldiers \\nalone and pass on!\\' he thought. \\n\\nAnd so it seemed that they would. The leading ores came loping along, \\npanting, holding their heads down. They were a gang of the smaller breeds \\nbeing driven unwilling to their Dark Lord\\'s wars; all they cared for was to \\nget the march over and escape the whip. Beside them, running up and down the \\nline, went two of the large fierce uruks, cracking lashes and shouting. File \\nafter file passed, and the tell-tale torchlight was already some way ahead. \\n\\nSam held his breath. Now more than half the line had gone by. Then suddenly \\none of the slave-drivers spied the two figures by the road-side. He flicked \\na whip at them and yelled: \\'Hi, you! Get up!\\' They did not answer, and with \\na shout he halted the whole company. \\n\\n\\'Come on, you slugs!\\' he cried. \\'This is no time for slouching.\\' He \\ntook a step towards them, and even in the gloom he recognized the devices on \\ntheir shields. \\'Deserting, eh?\\' he snarled. \\'Or thinking of it? All your \\nfolk should have been inside Udyn before yesterday evening. You know that. \\nUp you get and fall in, or I\\'ll have your numbers and report you.\\' \\n\\nThey struggled to their feet, and keeping bent, limping like footsore \\nsoldiers, they shuffled back towards the rear of the line. \\'No, not at the \\nrear!\\' the slave-driver shouted. \\'Three files up. And stay there, or you\\'ll \\nknow it, when I come down the line!\\' He sent his long whip-lash cracking \\nover their heads; then with another crack and a yell he started the company \\noff again at a brisk trot. \\n\\nIt was hard enough for poor Sam, tired as he was; but for Frodo it was \\na torment, and soon a nightmare. He set his teeth and tried to stop his mind \\nfrom thinking, and he struggled on. The stench of the sweating ores about \\nhim was stifling, and he began to gasp with thirst. On, on they went, and he \\nbent all his will to draw his breath and to make his legs keep going; and \\nyet to what evil end he toiled and endured he did not dare to think. There \\nwas no hope of falling out unseen: Now and again the ore-driver fell back \\nand jeered at them. \\n\\n\\'There now!\\' he laughed, flicking at their legs. \\'Where there\\'s a whip \\nthere\\'s a will, my slugs. Hold up! I\\'d give you a nice freshener now, only \\nyou\\'ll get as much lash as your skins will carry when you come in late to \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyour camp. Do you good. Don\\'t you know we\\'re at war?\\' \\n\\nThey had gone some miles, and the road was at last running down a long \\nslope into the plain, when Frodo\\'s strength began to give out and his will \\nwavered. He lurched and stumbled. Desperately Sam tried to help him and hold \\nhim up, though he felt that he could himself hardly stay the pace much \\nlonger. At any moment now he knew that the end would come: his master \\nwould \\n\\nfaint or fall, and all would be discovered, and their bitter efforts be in \\nvain. \\'I\\'ll have that big slave-driving devil anyway,\\' he thought. \\n\\nThen just as he was putting his hand to the hilt of his sword, there \\ncame an unexpected relief. They were out on the plain now and drawing near \\nthe entrance to Udyn. Some way in front of it, before the gate at the \\nbridge-end, the road from the west converged with others coming from the \\nsouth, and from Barad-dyr. Along all the roads troops were moving; for the \\nCaptains of the West were advancing and the Dark Lord was speeding his \\nforces north. So it chanced that several companies came together at the \\nroad-meeting, in the dark beyond the light of the watch-fires on the wall. \\n\\nAt once there was great jostling and cursing as each troop tried to get \\nfirst to the gate and the ending of their march. Though the drivers yelled \\nand plied their whips, scuffles broke out and some blades were drawn. A \\ntroop of heavy -armed uruks from Barad-dyr charged into the Durthang line and \\nthrew them into confusion. \\n\\nDazed as he was with pain and weariness, Sam woke up, grasped quickly \\nat his chance, and threw himself to the ground, dragging Frodo down with \\nhim. Ores fell over them, snarling and cursing. Slowly on hand and knee the \\nhobbits crawled away out of the turmoil, until at last unnoticed they \\ndropped over the further edge of the road. It had a high kerb by which \\ntroop-leaders could guide themselves in black night or fog, and it was \\nbanked up some feet above the level of the open land. \\n\\nThey lay still for a while. It was too dark to seek for cover, if \\nindeed there was any to find; but Sam felt that they ought at least to get \\nfurther away from the highways and out of the range of torch-light. \\n\\n\\'Come on, Mr. Frodo!\\' he whispered. \\'One more crawl, and then you can \\nlie still.\\' \\n\\nWith a last despairing effort Frodo raised himself on his hands, and \\nstruggled on for maybe twenty yards. Then he pitched down into a shallow pit \\nthat opened unexpectedly before them, and there he lay like a dead thing. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 3 . Mount Doom \\n\\n\\n\\nSam put his ragged orc-cloak under his master\\'s head, and covered them \\nboth with the grey robe of Lurien; and as he did so his thoughts went out to \\nthat fair land, and to the Elves, and he hoped that the cloth woven by their \\nhands might have some virtue to keep them hidden beyond all hope in this \\nwilderness of fear. He heard the scuffling and cries die down as the troops \\npassed on through the Isenmouthe. It seemed that in the confusion and the \\nmingling of many companies of various kinds they had not been missed, not \\nyet at any rate. \\n\\nSam took a sip of water, but pressed Frodo to drink, and when his \\nmaster had recovered a little he gave him a whole wafer of their precious \\nwaybread and made him eat it. Then, too worn out even to feel much fear, \\nthey stretched themselves out. They slept a little in uneasy fits; for their \\nsweat grew chill on them, and the hard stones bit them, and they shivered. \\nOut of the north from the Black Gate through Cirith Gorgor there flowed \\nwhispering along the ground a thin cold air. \\n\\nIn the morning a grey light came again, for in the high regions the \\nWest Wind still blew, but down on the stones behind the fences of the Black \\nLand the air seemed almost dead, chill and yet stifling. Sam looked up out \\nof the hollow. The land all about was dreary, flat and drab-hued. On the \\nroads nearby nothing was moving now; but Sam feared the watchful eyes on \\nthe \\n\\nwall of the Isenmouthe, no more than a furlong away northward. \\nSouth-eastward, far off like a dark standing shadow, loomed the Mountain. \\nSmokes were pouring from it and while those that rose into the upper air \\ntrailed away eastward, great rolling clouds floated down its sides and \\nspread over the land. A few miles to the north-east the foothills of the \\nAshen Mountains stood like sombre grey ghosts, behind which the misty \\nnorthern heights rose like a line of distant cloud hardly darker than the \\nlowering sky. \\n\\nSam tried to guess the distances and to decide what way they ought to \\ntake. It looks every step of fifty miles,\\' he muttered gloomily staring at \\nthe threatening mountain, \\'and that\\'ll take a week, if it takes a day, with \\nMr. Frodo as he is.\\' He shook his head, and as he worked things out, slowly \\n\\n\\n\\n\\na new dark thought grew in his mind. Never for long had hope died in his \\nstaunch heart, and always until now he had taken some thought for their \\nreturn. But the bitter truth came home to him at last: at best their \\nprovision would take them to their goal; and when the task was done, there \\nthey would come to an end, alone, houseless, foodless in the midst of a \\nterrible desert. There could be no return. \\n\\n\\'So that was the job I felt I had to do when I started,\\' thought Sam: \\n\\n\\'to help Mr. Frodo to the last step and then die with him? Well, if that is \\nthe job then I must do it. But I would dearly like to see By water again, and \\nRosie Cotton and her brothers, and the Gaffer and Marigold and all. I can\\'t \\nthink somehow that Gandalf would have sent Mr. Frodo on this errand if there \\nhadn\\'t a\\' been any hope of his ever coming back at all. Things all went \\nwrong when he went down in Moria. I wish he hadn\\'t. He would have done \\nsomething.\\' \\n\\nBut even as hope died in Sam, or seemed to die, it was turned to a new \\nstrength. Sam\\'s plain hobbit-face grew stern, almost grim, as the will \\nhardened in him, and he felt through all his limbs a thrill, as if he was \\nturning into some creature of stone and steel that neither despair nor \\nweariness nor endless barren miles could subdue. \\n\\nWith a new sense of responsibility he brought his eyes back to the \\nground near at hand, studying the next move. As the light grew a little he \\nsaw to his surprise that what from a distance had seemed wide and \\nfeatureless flats were in fact all broken and tumbled. Indeed the whole \\nsurface of the plains of Gorgoroth was pocked with great holes, as if, while \\nit was still a waste of soft mud, it had been smitten with a shower of bolts \\nand huge slingstones. The largest of these holes were rimmed with ridges of \\nbroken rock, and broad fissures ran out from them in all directions. It was \\na land in which it would be possible to creep from hiding to hiding, unseen \\nby all but the most watchful eyes: possible at least for one who was strong \\nand had no need for speed. For the hungry and worn, who had far to go before \\nlife failed, it had an evil look. \\n\\nThinking of all these things Sam went back to his master. He had no \\nneed to rouse him. Frodo was lying on his back with eyes open, staring at \\nthe cloudy sky. \\'Well, Mr. Frodo,\\' said Sam, \\'I\\'ve been having a look round \\nand thinking a bit. There\\'s nothing on the roads, and we\\'d best be getting \\naway while there\\'s a chance. Can you manage it?\\' \\n\\n\\'I can manage it,\\' said Frodo. \\'I must.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce more they started, crawling from hollow to hollow, flitting behind \\nsuch cover as they could find, but moving always in a slant towards the \\nfoothills of the northern range. But as they went the most easterly of the \\nroads followed them, until it ran off, hugging the skirts of the mountains, \\naway into a wall of black shadow far ahead. Neither man nor ore now moved \\nalong its flat grey stretches; for the Dark Lord had almost completed the \\nmovement of his forces, and even in the fastness of his own realm he sought \\nthe secrecy of night, fearing the winds of the world that had turned against \\nhim, tearing aside his veils, and troubled with tidings of bold spies that \\nhad passed through his fences. \\n\\nThe hobbits had gone a few weary miles when they halted. Frodo seemed \\nnearly spent. Sam saw that he could not go much further in this fashion, \\ncrawling, stooping, now picking a doubtful way very slowly, now hurrying at \\na stumbling run. \\n\\n\\'I\\'m going back on to the road while the light lasts, Mr. Frodo,\\' he \\nsaid. \\'Trust to luck again! It nearly failed us last time, but it didn\\'t \\nquite. A steady pace for a few more miles, and then a rest.\\' \\n\\nHe was taking a far greater risk than he knew; but Frodo was too much \\noccupied with his burden and with the struggle in his mind to debate, and \\nalmost too hopeless to care. They climbed on to the causeway and trudged \\nalong, down the hard cruel road that led to the Dark Tower itself. But their \\nluck held, and for the rest of that day they met no living or moving thing; \\nand when night fell they vanished into the darkness of Mordor. All the land \\nnow brooded as at the coming of a great storm: for the Captains of the West \\nhad passed the Cross-roads and set flames in the deadly fields of Imlad \\nMorgul. \\n\\nSo the desperate journey went on, as the Ring went south and the \\nbanners of the kings rode north. For the hobbits each day, each mile, was \\nmore bitter than the one before, as their strength lessened and the land \\nbecame more evil. They met no enemies by day. At times by night, as they \\ncowered or drowsed uneasily in some hiding beside the road, they heard cries \\nand the noise of many feet or the swift passing of some cruelly ridden \\nsteed. But far worse than all such perils was the ever -approaching threat \\nthat beat upon them as they went: the dreadful menace of the Power that \\nwaited, brooding in deep thought and sleepless malice behind the dark veil \\nabout its Throne. Nearer and nearer it drew, looming blacker, like the \\noncoming of a wall of night at the last end of the world. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere came at last a dreadful nightfall; and even as the Captains of \\nthe West drew near to the end of the living lands, the two wanderers came to \\nan hour of blank despair. Four days had passed since they had escaped from \\nthe ores, but the time lay behind them like an ever -darkening dream. All \\nthis last day Frodo had not spoken, but had walked half-bowed, often \\nstumbling, as if his eyes no longer saw the way before his feet. Sam guessed \\nthat among all their pains he bore the worst, the growing weight of the \\nRing, a burden on the body and a torment to his mind. Anxiously Sam had \\nnoted how his master\\'s left hand would often be raised as if to ward on a \\nblow, or to screen his shrinking eyes from a dreadful Eye that sought to \\nlook in them. And sometimes his right hand would creep to his breast, \\nclutching, and then slowly, as the will recovered mastery, it would be \\nwithdrawn. \\n\\nNow as the blackness of night returned Frodo sat, his head between his \\nknees, his arms hanging wearily to the ground where his hands lay feebly \\ntwitching. Sam watched him, till night covered them both and hid them from \\none another. Fie could no longer find any words to say; and he turned to his \\nown dark thoughts. As for himself, though weary and under a shadow of fear, \\nhe still had some strength left. The lembas had a virtue without which they \\nwould long ago have lain down to die. It did not satisfy desire, and at \\ntimes Sam\\'s mind was filled with the memories of food, and the longing for \\nsimple bread and meats. And yet this way bread of the Elves had a potency \\nthat increased as travellers relied on it alone and did not mingle it with \\nother foods. It fed the will, and it gave strength to endure, and to master \\nsinew and limb beyond the measure of mortal kind. But now a new decision \\nmust be made. They could not follow this road any longer; for it went on \\neastward into the great Shadow, but the Mountain now loomed upon their \\nright, almost due south, and they must turn towards it. Yet still before it \\nthere stretched a wide region of fuming, barren, ash-ridden land. \\n\\n\\'Water, water!\\' muttered Sam. He had stinted himself, and in his \\nparched mouth his tongue seemed thick and swollen; but for all his care they \\nnow had very little left, perhaps half his bottle, and maybe there were \\nstill days to go. All would long ago have been spent, if they had not dared \\nto follow the ore-road. For at long intervals on that highway cisterns had \\nbeen built for the use of troops sent in haste through the waterless \\nregions. In one Sam had found some water left, stale, muddied by the ores, \\nbut still sufficient for their desperate case. Yet that was now a day ago. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was no hope of any more. \\n\\nAt last wearied with his cares Sam drowsed, leaving the morrow till it \\ncame; he could do no more. Dream and waking mingled uneasily. He saw \\nlights \\n\\nlike gloating yes, and dark creeping shapes, and he heard noises as of wild \\nbeasts or the dreadful cries of tortured things; and he would start up to \\nfind the world all dark and only empty blackness all about him. Once only, \\nas he stood and stared wildly round, did it seem that, though now awake, he \\ncould still see pale lights like eyes; but soon they flickered and vanished. \\n\\nThe hateful night passed slowly and reluctantly. Such daylight as \\nfollowed was dim; for here as the Mountain drew near the air was ever mirky, \\nwhile out from the Dark Tower there crept the veils of Shadow that Sauron \\nwove about himself. Frodo was lying on his back not moving. Sam stood \\nbeside \\n\\nhim, reluctant to speak, and yet knowing that the word now lay with him: he \\nmust set his master\\'s will to work for another effort. At length, stooping \\nand caressing Frodo\\'s brow, he spoke in his ear. \\n\\n\\'Wake up, Master!\\' he said. \\'Time for another start.\\' \\n\\nAs if roused by a sudden bell, Frodo rose quickly, and stood up and \\nlooked away southwards; but when his eyes beheld the Mountain and the desert \\nhe quailed again. \\n\\n\\'I can\\'t manage it, Sam,\\' he said. \\'It is such a weight to carry, such \\na weight.\\' \\n\\nSam knew before he spoke, that it was vain, and that such words might \\ndo more harm than good, but in his pity he could not keep silent. \\'Then let \\nme carry it a bit for you, Master,\\' he said. \\'You know I would, and gladly, \\nas long as I have any strength.\\' \\n\\nA wild light came into Frodo\\'s eyes. \\'Stand away! Don\\'t touch me!\\' he \\ncried. \\'It is mine, I say. Be off!\\' His hand strayed to his sword-hilt. But \\nthen quickly his voice changed. \\'No, no, Sam,\\' he said sadly. \\'But you must \\nunderstand. It is my burden, and no one else can bear it. It is too late \\nnow, Sam dear. You can\\'t help me in that way again. I am almost in its power \\nnow. I could not give it up, and if you tried to take it I should go mad.\\' \\n\\nSam nodded. \\'I understand,\\' he said. \\'But I\\'ve been thinking, Mr. \\n\\nFrodo, there\\'s other things we might do without. Why not lighten the load a \\nbit? We\\'re going that way now, as straight as we can make it.\\' He pointed to \\nthe Mountain. \\'It\\'s no good taking anything we\\'re not sure to need.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrodo looked again towards the Mountain. \\'No,\\' he said, \\'we shan\\'t need \\nmuch on that road. And at its end nothing.\\' Picking up his ore-shield he \\nflung it away and threw his helmet after it. Then pulling off the grey cloak \\nhe undid the heavy belt and let it fall to the ground, and the sheathed \\nsword with it. The shreds of the black cloak he tore off and scattered. \\n\\n\\'There, I\\'ll be an ore no more,\\' he cried, \\'and I\\'ll bear no weapon \\nfair or foul. Let them take me, if they will!\\' \\n\\nSam did likewise, and put aside his ore-gear; and he took out all the \\nthings in his pack. Somehow each of them had become dear to him, if only \\nbecause he had borne them so far with so much toil. Hardest of all it was to \\npart with his cooking-gear. Tears welled in his eyes at the thought of \\ncasting it away. \\n\\n\\'Do you remember that bit of rabbit, Mr. Frodo?\\' he said. \\'And our \\nplace under the warm bank in Captain Faramir\\'s country, the day I saw an \\noliphaunt?\\' \\n\\n\\'No, I am afraid not, Sam,\\' said Frodo. \\'At least, I know that such \\nthings happened, but I cannot see them. No taste of food, no feel of water, \\nno sound of wind, no memory of tree or grass or flower, no image of moon or \\nstar are left to me. I am naked in the dark. Sam, and there is no veil \\nbetween me and the wheel of fire. I begin to see it even with my waking \\neyes, and all else fades.\\' \\n\\nSam went to him and kissed his hand. \\'Then the sooner we\\'re rid of it, \\nthe sooner to rest,\\' he said haltingly, finding no better words to say. \\n\\n\\'Talking won\\'t mend nothing,\\' he muttered to himself, as he gathered up all \\nthe things that they had chosen to cast away. He was not willing to leave \\nthem lying open in the wilderness for any eyes to see. \\'Stinker picked up \\nthat ore-shirt, seemingly, and he isn\\'t going to add a sword to it. His \\nhands are bad enough when empty. And he isn\\'t going to mess with my pans!\\' \\nWith that he carried all the gear away to one of the many gaping fissures \\nthat scored the land and threw them in. The clatter of his precious pans as \\nthey fell down into the dark was like a death-knell to his heart. \\n\\nHe came back to Frodo, and then of his elven-rope he cut a short piece \\nto serve his master as a girdle and bind the grey cloak close about his \\nwaist. The rest he carefully coiled and put back in his pack. Beside that he \\nkept only the remnants of their waybread and the water-bottle, and Sting \\nstill hanging by his belt; and hidden away in a pocket of his tunic next his \\nbreast the phial of Galadriel and the little box that she gave him for his \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nown. \\n\\nNow at last they turned their faces to the Mountain and set out, \\nthinking no more of concealment, bending their weariness and failing wills \\nonly to the one task of going on. In the dimness of its dreary day few \\nthings even in that land of vigilance could have espied them, save from \\nclose at hand. Of all the slaves of the Dark Lord, only the Nazgyl could \\nhave warned him of the peril that crept, small but indomitable, into the \\nvery heart of his guarded realm. But the Nazgyl and their black wings were \\nabroad on another errand: they were gathered far away, shadowing the march \\nof the Captains of the West, and thither the thought of the Dark Tower was \\nturned. \\n\\nThat day it seemed to Sam that his master had found some new strength, \\nmore than could be explained by the small lightening of the load that he had \\nto carry. In the first marches they went further and faster than he had \\nhoped. The land was rough and hostile, and yet they made much progress, and \\never the Mountain drew nearer. But as the day wore on and all too soon the \\ndim light began to fail, Frodo stooped again, and began to stagger, as if \\nthe renewed effort had squandered his remaining strength. \\n\\nAt their last halt he sank down and said: Tm thirsty, Sam,\\' and did \\nnot speak again. Sam gave him a mouthful of water; only one more mouthful \\nremained. He went without himself; and now as once more the night of \\nMordor \\n\\nclosed over them, through all his thoughts there came the memory of water; \\nand every brook or stream or fount that he had ever seen, under green \\nwillow-shades or twinkling in the sun, danced and rippled for his torment \\nbehind the blindness of his eyes. He felt the cool mud about his toes as he \\npaddled in the Pool at Bywater with Jolly Cotton and Tom and Nibs, and their \\nsister Rosie. \\'But that was years ago,\\' he sighed, \\'and far away. The way \\nback, if there is one, goes past the Mountain.\\' \\n\\nHe could not sleep and he held a debate with himself. \\'Well, come now, \\nwe\\'ve done better than you hoped,\\' he said sturdily. \\'Began well anyway. I \\nreckon we crossed half the distance before we stopped. One more day will do \\nit.\\' And then he paused. \\n\\n\\'Don\\'t be a fool, Sam Gamgee,\\' came an answer in his own voice. \\'He \\nwon\\'t go another day like that, if he moves at all. And you can\\'t go on much \\nlonger giving him all the water and most of the food.\\' \\n\\n\\'I can go on a good way though, and I will.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Where to?\\' \\n\\n\\'To the Mountain, of course.\\' \\n\\n\\'But what then, Sam Gamgee, what then? When you get there, what are you \\ngoing to do? He won\\'t be able to do anything for himself.\\' \\n\\nTo his dismay Sam realized that he had not got an answer to this. He \\nhad no clear idea at all. Frodo had not spoken much to him of his errand, \\nand Sam only knew vaguely that the Ring had somehow to be put into the fire. \\n\\'The Cracks of Doom,\\' he muttered, the old name rising to his mind. \\'Well, \\nif Master knows how to find them, I don\\'t.\\' \\n\\n\\'There you are!\\' came the answer. \\'It\\'s all quite useless. He said so \\nhimself. You are the fool, going on hoping and toiling. You could have lain \\ndown and gone to sleep together days ago, if you hadn\\'t been so dogged. But \\nyou\\'ll die just the same, or worse. You might just as well lie down now and \\ngive it up. You\\'ll never get to the top anyway.\\' \\n\\n\\'I\\'ll get there, if I leave everything but my bones behind,\\' said Sam. \\n\\n\\'And I\\'ll carry Mr. Frodo up myself, if it breaks my back and heart. So stop \\narguing!\\' \\n\\nAt that moment Sam felt a tremor in the ground beneath him, and he \\nheard or sensed a deep remote rumble as of thunder imprisoned under the \\nearth. There was a brief red flame that flickered under the clouds and died \\naway. The Mountain too slept uneasily. \\n\\nThe last stage of their journey to Orodruin came, and it was a torment \\ngreater than Sam had ever thought that he could bear. He was in pain, and so \\nparched that he could no longer swallow even a mouthful of food. It remained \\ndark, not only because of the smokes of the Mountain: there seemed to be a \\nstorm coming up, and away to the south-east there was a shimmer of \\nlightnings under the black skies. Worst of all, the air was full of fumes; \\nbreathing was painful and difficult, and a dizziness came on them, so that \\nthey staggered and often fell. And yet their wills did not yield, and they \\nstruggled on. \\n\\nThe Mountain crept up ever nearer, until, if they lifted their heavy \\nheads, it filled all their sight, looming vast before them: a huge mass of \\nash and slag and burned stone, out of which a sheer-sided cone was raised \\ninto the clouds. Before the daylong dusk ended and true night came again \\nthey had crawled and stumbled to its very feet. \\n\\nWith a gasp Frodo cast himself on the ground. Sam sat by him. To his \\nsurprise he felt tired but lighter, and his head seemed clear again. No more \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndebates disturbed his mind. He knew all the arguments of despair and would \\nnot listen to them. His will was set, and only death would break it. He felt \\nno longer either desire or need of sleep, but rather of watchfulness. He \\nknew that all the hazards and perils were now drawing together to a point: \\nthe next day would be a day of doom, the day of final effort or disaster, \\nthe last gasp. \\n\\nBut when would it come? The night seemed endless and timeless, minute \\nafter minute falling dead and adding up to no passing hour, bringing no \\nchange. Sam began to wonder if a second darkness had begun and no day \\nwould \\n\\never reappear. At last he groped for Frodo\\'s hand. It was cold and \\ntrembling. His master was shivering. \\n\\n\\'I didn\\'t ought to have left my blanket behind,\\' muttered Sam; and \\nlying down he tried to comfort Frodo with his arms and body. Then sleep took \\nhim, and the dim fight of the last day of their quest found them side by \\nside. The wind had fallen the day before as it shifted from the West, and \\nnow it came from the North and began to rise; and slowly the light of the \\nunseen Sun filtered down into the shadows where the hobbits lay. \\n\\n\\'Now for it! Now for the last gasp!\\' said Sam as he struggled to his \\nfeet. He bent over Frodo, rousing him gently. Frodo groaned; but with a \\ngreat effort of will he staggered up; and then he fell upon his knees again. \\n\\nHe raised his eyes with difficulty to the dark slopes of Mount Doom towering \\nabove him, and then pitifully he began to crawl forward on his hands. \\n\\nSam looked at him and wept in his heart, but no tears came to his dry \\nand stinging eyes. \\'I said I\\'d carry him, if it broke my back,\\' he muttered, \\n\\n\\'and I will!\\' \\n\\n\\'Come, Mr. Frodo!\\' he cried. \\'I can\\'t carry it for you, but I can carry \\nyou and it as well. So up you get! Come on, Mr. Frodo dear! Sam will give \\nyou a ride. Just tell him where to go, and he\\'ll go.\\' \\n\\nAs Frodo clung upon his back, arms loosely about his neck, legs clasped \\nfirmly under his arms, Sam staggered to his feet; and then to his amazement \\nhe felt the burden light. He had feared that he would have barely strength \\nto lift his master alone, and beyond that he had expected to share in the \\ndreadful dragging weight of the accursed Ring. But it was not so. Whether \\nbecause Frodo was so worn by his long pains, wound of knife, and venomous \\nsting, and sorrow, fear, and homeless wandering, or because some gift of \\nfinal strength was given to him, Sam lifted Frodo with no more difficulty \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthan if he were carrying a hobbit-child pig-a-back in some romp on the lawns \\nor hayfields of the Shire. He took a deep breath and started off. \\n\\nThey had reached the Mountain\\'s foot on its northern side, and a little \\nto the westward; there its long grey slopes, though broken, were not sheer. \\nFrodo did not speak, and so Sam struggled on as best he could, having no \\nguidance but the will to climb as high as might be before his strength gave \\nout and his will broke. On he toiled, up and up, turning this way and that \\nto lessen the slope, often stumbling forward, and at the last crawling like \\na snail with a heavy burden on its back. When his will could drive him no \\nfurther, and his limbs gave way, he stopped and laid his master gently down. \\n\\nFrodo opened his eyes and drew a breath. It was easier to breathe up \\nhere above the reeks that coiled and drifted down below. \\'Thank you, Sam,\\' \\nhe said in a cracked whisper. \\'How far is there to go?\\' \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know,\\' said Sam, \\'because I don\\'t know where we\\'re going.\\' \\n\\nHe looked back, and then he looked up; and he was amazed to see how far \\nhis last effort had brought him. The Mountain standing ominous and alone had \\nlooked taller than it was. Sam saw now that it was less lofty than the high \\npasses of the Ephel D(r)ath which he and Frodo had scaled. The confused and \\ntumbled shoulders of its great base rose for maybe three thousand feet above \\nthe plain, and above them was reared half as high again its tall central \\ncone, like a vast oast or chimney capped with a jagged crater. But already \\nSam was more than half way up the base, and the plain of Gorgoroth was dim \\nbelow him, wrapped in fume and shadow. As he looked up he would have \\ngiven a \\n\\nshout, if his parched throat had allowed him; for amid the rugged humps and \\nshoulders above him he saw plainly a path or road. It climbed like a rising \\ngirdle from the west and wound snakelike about the Mountain, until before it \\nwent round out of view it reached the foot of the cone upon its eastern \\nside. \\n\\nSam could not see the course immediately above him, where it was \\nlowest, for a steep slope went up from where he stood; but he guessed that \\nif he could only struggle on just a little way further up, they would strike \\nthis path. A gleam of hope returned to him. They might conquer the Mountain \\nyet. \\'Why, it might have been put there a-purpose!\\' he said to himself. \\'If \\nit wasn\\'t there, I\\'d have to say I was beaten in the end.\\' \\n\\nThe path was not put there for the purposes of Sam. He did not know it, \\nbut he was looking at Sauron\\'s Road from Barad-dyr to the Sammath Naur, the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChambers of Fire. Out from the Dark Tower\\'s huge western gate it came over a \\ndeep abyss by a vast bridge of iron, and then passing into the plain it ran \\nfor a league between two smoking chasms, and so reached a long sloping \\ncauseway that led up on to the Mountain\\'s eastern side. Thence, turning and \\nencircling all its wide girth from south to north, it climbed at last, high \\nin the upper cone, but still far from the reeking summit, to a dark entrance \\nthat gazed back east straight to the Window of the Eye in Sauron\\'s \\nshadow-mantled fortress. Often blocked or destroyed by the tumults of the \\nMountain\\'s furnaces, always that road was repaired and cleaned again by the \\nlabours of countless ores. \\n\\nSam drew a deep breath. There was a path, but how he was to get up the \\nslope to it he did not know. First he must ease his aching back. Fie lay flat \\nbeside Frodo for a while. Neither spoke. Slowly the light grew. Suddenly a \\nsense of urgency which he did not understand came to Sam. It was almost as \\nif he had been called: \\'Now, now, or it will be too late!\\' He braced himself \\nand got up. Frodo also seemed to have felt the call. He struggled to his \\nknees. \\n\\n\\'I\\'ll crawl, Sam,\\' he gasped. \\n\\nSo foot by foot, like small grey insects, they crept up the slope. They \\ncame to the path and found that it was broad, paved with broken rubble and \\nbeaten ash. Frodo clambered on to it, and then moved as if by some \\ncompulsion he turned slowly to face the East. Far off the shadows of Sauron \\nhung; but torn by some gust of wind out of the world, or else moved by some \\ngreat disquiet within, the mantling clouds swirled, and for a moment drew \\naside; and then he saw, rising black, blacker and darker than the vast \\nshades amid which it stood, the cruel pinnacles and iron crown of the \\ntopmost tower of Barad-dyr. One moment only it stared out, but as from some \\ngreat window immeasurably high there stabbed northward a flame of red, the \\nflicker of a piercing Eye; and then the shadows were furled again and the \\nterrible vision was removed. The Eye was not turned to them: it was gazing \\nnorth to where the Captains of the West stood at bay, and thither all its \\nmalice was now bent, as the Power moved to strike its deadly blow; but Frodo \\nat that dreadful glimpse fell as one stricken mortally. His hand sought the \\nchain about his neck. \\n\\nSam knelt by him. Faint, almost inaudibly, he heard Frodo whispering: \\n\\'Help me, Sam! Help me, Sam! Hold my hand! I can\\'t stop it.\\' Sam took his \\nmaster\\'s hands and laid them together, palm to palm, and kissed them; and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthen he held them gently between his own. The thought came suddenly to him: \\n\\'He\\'s spotted us! It\\'s all up, or it soon will be. Now, Sam Gamgee, this is \\nthe end of ends.\\' \\n\\nAgain he lifted Frodo and drew his hands down to his own breast, \\nletting his master\\'s legs dangle. Then he bowed his head and struggled off \\nalong the climbing road. It was not as easy a way to take as it had looked \\nat first. By fortune the fires that had poured forth in the great turmoils \\nwhen Sam stood upon Cirith Ungol had flowed down mainly on the southern \\nand \\n\\nwestern slopes, and the road on this side was not blocked. Yet in many \\nplaces it had crumbled away or was crossed by gaping rents. After climbing \\neastward for some time it bent back upon itself at a sharp angle and went \\nwestward fox a space. There at the bend it was cut deep through a crag of \\nold weathered stone once long ago vomited from the Mountain\\'s furnaces. \\nPanting under his load Sam turned the bend; and even as he did so, out of \\nthe corner of his eye, he had a glimpse of something falling from the crag, \\nlike a small piece of black stone that had toppled off as he passed. \\n\\nA sudden weight smote him and he crashed forward, tearing the backs of \\nhis hands that still clasped his master\\'s. Then he knew what had happened, \\nfor above him as he lay he heard a hated voice. \\n\\n\\'Wicked masster!\\' it hissed. \\'Wicked masster cheats us; cheats Smjagol, \\ngollum. He musstn\\'t go that way. He musstn\\'thurt Preciouss. Give it to \\nSmjagol, yess, give it to us! Give it to uss!\\' \\n\\nWith a violent heave Sam rose up. At once he drew his sword; but he \\ncould do nothing. Gollum and Frodo were locked together. Gollum was tearing \\nat his master, trying to get at the chain and the Ring. This was probably \\nthe only thing that could have roused the dying embers of Frodo\\'s heart and \\nwill: an attack, an attempt to wrest his treasure from him by force. He \\nfought back with a sudden fury that amazed Sam, and Gollum also. Even so \\nthings might have gone far otherwise, if Gollum himself had remained \\nunchanged; but whatever dreadful paths, lonely and hungry and waterless, he \\nhad trodden, driven by a devouring desire and a terrible fear, they had left \\ngrievous marks on him. He was a lean, starved, haggard thing, all bones and \\ntight-drawn sallow skin. A wild light flamed in his eyes, but his malice was \\nno longer matched by his old griping strength. Frodo flung him off and rose \\nup quivering. \\n\\n\\'Down, down!\\' he gasped, clutching his hand to his breast, so that \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbeneath the cover of his leather shirt he clasped the Ring. \\'Down you \\ncreeping thing, and out of my path! Your time is at an end. You cannot \\nbetray me or slay me now.\\' \\n\\nThen suddenly, as before under the eaves of the Emyn Muil, Sam saw \\nthese two rivals with other vision. A crouching shape, scarcely more than \\nthe shadow of a living thing, a creature now wholly ruined and defeated, yet \\nfilled with a hideous lust and rage; and before it stood stern, untouchable \\nnow by pity, a figure robed in white, but at its breast it held a wheel of \\nfire. Out of the fire there spoke a commanding voice. \\n\\n\\'Begone, and trouble me no more! If you touch me ever again, you shall \\nbe cast yourself into the Fire of Doom.\\' \\n\\nThe crouching shape backed away, terror in its blinking eyes, and yet \\nat the same time insatiable desire. \\n\\nThen the vision passed and Sam saw Frodo standing, hand on breast, his \\nbreath coming in great gasps, and Gollum at his feet, resting on his knees \\nwith his wide-splayed hands upon the ground. \\n\\n\\'Fook out!\\' cried Sam. \\'Tie\\'ll spring!\\' He stepped forward, brandishing \\nhis sword. \\'Quick, Master!\\' he gasped. \\'Go on! Go on! No time to lose. I\\'ll \\ndeal with him. Go on!\\' \\n\\nFrodo looked at him as if at one now far away. \\'Yes, I must go on,\\' he \\nsaid. \\'Farewell, Sam! This is the end at last. On Mount Doom doom shall \\nfall. Farewell!\\' He turned and went on, walking slowly but erect up the \\nclimbing path. \\n\\n\\'Now!\\' said Sam. \\'At last I can deal with you!\\' He leaped forward with \\ndrawn blade ready for battle. But Gollum did not spring. He fell flat upon \\nthe ground and whimpered. \\n\\n\\'Don\\'t kill us,\\' he wept. \\'Don\\'t hurt us with nassty cruel steel! Fet \\nus live, yes, live just a little longer. Fost lost! We\\'re lost. And when \\nPrecious goes we\\'ll die, yes, die into the dust.\\' He clawed up the ashes of \\nthe path with his long fleshless fingers. \\'Dusst!\\' he hissed. \\n\\nSam\\'s hand wavered. His mind was hot with wrath and the memory of evil. \\nIt would be just to slay this treacherous, murderous creature, just and many \\ntimes deserved; and also it seemed the only safe thing to do. But deep in \\nhis heart there was something that restrained him: he could not strike this \\nthing lying in the dust, forlorn, ruinous, utterly wretched. He himself, \\nthough only for a little while, had borne the Ring, and now dimly he guessed \\nthe agony of Gollum\\'s shrivelled mind and body, enslaved to that Ring, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nunable to find peace or relief ever in life again. But Sam had no words to \\nexpress what he felt. \\n\\n\\'Oh, curse you, you stinking thing!\\' he said. \\'Go away! Be off! I don\\'t \\ntrust you, not as far as I could kick you; but be off. Or I shall hurt you, \\nyes, with nasty cruel steel.\\' \\n\\nGollum got up on all fours, and backed away for several paces, and then \\nhe turned, and as Sam aimed a kick at him he fled away down the path. Sam \\ngave no more heed to him. He suddenly remembered his master. He looked \\nup \\n\\nthe path and could not see him. As fast as he could he trudged up the road. \\n\\nIf he had looked back, he might have seen not far below Gollum turn again, \\nand then with a wild light of madness glaring in his eyes come, swiftly but \\nwarily, creeping on behind, a slinking shadow among the stones. \\n\\nThe path climbed on. Soon it bent again and. with a last eastward \\ncourse passed in a cutting along the face of the cone and came to the dark \\ndoor in the Mountain\\'s side, the door of the Sammath Naur. Far away now \\nrising towards the South the sun, piercing the smokes and haze, burned \\nominous, a dull bleared disc of red; but all Mordor lay about the Mountain \\nlike a dead land, silent, shadow-folded, waiting for some dreadful stroke. \\n\\nSam came to the gaping mouth and peered in. It was dark and hot, and a \\ndeep rumbling shook the air. \\'Frodo! Master!\\' he called. There was no \\nanswer. For a moment he stood, his heart beating with wild fears, and then \\nhe plunged in. A shadow followed him. \\n\\nAt first he could see nothing. In his great need he drew out once more \\nthe phial of Galadriel, but it was pale and cold in his trembling hand and \\nthrew no light into that stifling dark. He was come to the heart of the \\nrealm of Sauron and the forges of his ancient might, greatest in \\nMiddle-earth; all other powers were here subdued. Fearfully he took a few \\nuncertain steps in the dark, and then all at once there came a flash of red \\nthat leaped upward, and smote the high black roof. Then Sam saw that he was \\nin a long cave or tunnel that bored into the Mountain\\'s smoking cone. But \\nonly a short way ahead its floor and the walls on either side were cloven by \\na great fissure, out of which the red glare came, now leaping up, now dying \\ndown into darkness; and all the while far below there was a rumour and a \\ntrouble as of great engines throbbing and labouring. \\n\\nThe light sprang up again, and there on the brink of the chasm, at the \\nvery Crack of Doom, stood Frodo, black against the glare, tense, erect, but \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstill as if he had been turned to stone. \\n\\n\\'Master!\\' cried Sam. \\n\\nThen Frodo stirred and spoke with a clear voice, indeed with a voice \\nclearer and more powerful than Sam had ever heard him use, and it rose above \\nthe throb and turmoil of Mount Doom, ringing in the roof and walls. \\n\\n\\'I have come,\\' he said. \\'But I do not choose now to do what I came to \\ndo. I will not do this deed. The Ring is mine!\\' And suddenly, as he set it \\non his finger, he vanished from Sam\\'s sight. Sam gasped, but he had no \\nchance to cry out, for at that moment many things happened. \\n\\nSomething struck Sam violently in the back, his legs were knocked from \\nunder him and he was flung aside, striking his head against the stony floor, \\nas a dark shape sprang over him. He lay still and for a moment all went \\nblack. \\n\\nAnd far away, as Frodo put on the Ring and claimed it for his own, even \\nin Sammath Naur the very heart of his realm, the Power in Barad-dyr was \\nshaken, and the Tower trembled from its foundations to its proud and bitter \\ncrown. The Dark Lord was suddenly aware of him, and his Eye piercing all \\nshadows looked across the plain to the door that he had made; and the \\nmagnitude of his own folly was revealed to him in a blinding flash, and all \\nthe devices of his enemies were at last laid bare. Then his wrath blazed in \\nconsuming flame, but his fear rose like a vast black smoke to choke him. For \\nhe knew his deadly peril and the thread upon which his doom now hung. \\n\\nFrom all his policies and webs of fear and treachery, from all his \\nstratagems and wars his mind shook free; and throughout his realm a tremor \\nran, his slaves quailed, and his armies halted, and his captains suddenly \\nsteerless, bereft of will, wavered and despaired. For they were forgotten. \\n\\nThe whole mind and purpose of the Power that wielded them was now bent \\nwith \\n\\noverwhelming force upon the Mountain. At his summons, wheeling with a \\nrending cry, in a last desperate race there flew, faster than the winds, the \\nNazgyl the Ring wraiths, and with a storm of wings they hurtled southwards to \\nMount Doom. \\n\\nSam got up. He was dazed, and blood streaming from his head dripped in \\nhis eyes. He groped forward, and then he saw a strange and terrible thing. \\nGollum on the edge of the abyss was fighting like a mad thing with an unseen \\nfoe. To and fro he swayed, now so near the brink that almost he tumbled in, \\nnow dragging back, falling to the ground, rising, and falling again. And all \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe while he hissed but spoke no words. \\n\\nThe fires below awoke in anger, the red light blazed, and all the \\ncavern was filled with a great glare and heat. Suddenly Sam saw Gollum\\'s \\nlong hands draw upwards to his mouth; his white fangs gleamed, and then \\nsnapped as they bit. Frodo gave a cry, and there he was, fallen upon his \\nknees at the chasm\\'s edge. But Gollum, dancing like a mad thing, held aloft \\nthe ring, a finger still thrust within its circle. It shone now as if verily \\nit was wrought of living fire. \\n\\n\\'Precious, precious, precious!\\' Gollum cried. \\'My Precious! O my \\nPrecious!\\' And with that, even as his eyes were lifted up to gloat on his \\nprize, he stepped too far, toppled, wavered for a moment on the brink, and \\nthen with a shriek he fell. Out of the depths came his last wail Precious, \\nand he was gone. \\n\\nThere was a roar and a great confusion of noise. Fires leaped up and \\nlicked the roof. The throbbing grew to a great tumult, and the Mountain \\nshook. Sam ran to Frodo and picked him up and carried him. out to the door. \\nAnd there upon the dark threshold of the Sammath Naur, high above the plains \\nof Mordor, such wonder and terror came on him that he stood still forgetting \\nall else, and gazed as one turned to stone. \\n\\nA brief vision he had of swirling cloud, and in the midst of it towers \\nand battlements, tall as hills, founded upon a mighty mountain -throne above \\nimmeasurable pits; great courts and dungeons, eyeless prisons sheer as \\ncliffs, and gaping gates of steel and adamant: and then all passed. Towers \\nfell and mountains slid; walls crumbled and melted, crashing down; vast \\nspires of smoke and spouting steams went billowing up, up, until they \\ntoppled like an overwhelming wave, and its wild crest curled and came \\nfoaming down upon the land. And then at last over the miles between there \\ncame a rumble, rising to a deafening crash and roar; the earth shook, the \\nplain heaved and cracked, and Orodruin reeled. Fire belched from its riven \\nsummit. The skies burst into thunder seared with lightning. Down like \\nlashing whips fell a torrent of black rain. And into the heart of the storm, \\nwith a cry that pierced all other sounds, tearing the clouds asunder, the \\nNazgyl came, shooting like flaming bolts, as caught in the fiery ruin of \\nhill and sky they crackled, withered, and went out. \\n\\n\\'Well, this is the end, Sam Gamgee,\\' said a voice by his side. And \\nthere was Frodo, pale and worn, and yet himself again; and in his eyes there \\nwas peace now, neither strain of will, nor madness, nor any fear. His burden \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwas taken away. There was the dear master of the sweet days in the Shire. \\n\\n\\'Master!\\' cried Sam. and fell upon his knees. In all that ruin of the \\nworld for the moment he felt only joy, great joy. The burden was gone. His \\nmaster had been saved; he was himself again, he was free. And then Sam \\ncaught sight of the maimed and bleeding hand. \\n\\n\\'Your poor hand!\\' he said. \\'And I have nothing to bind it with, or \\ncomfort it. I would have spared him a whole hand of mine rather. But he\\'s \\ngone now beyond recall, gone for ever.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Frodo. \\'But do you remember Gandalf s words: Even Gollum \\nmay have something yet to do? But for him, Sam, I could not have destroyed \\nthe Ring. The Quest would have been in vain, even at the bitter end. So let \\nus forgive him! For the Quest is achieved, and now all is over. I am glad \\nyou are here with me. Here at the end of all things, Sam.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 4 . The Field of Cormallen \\n\\n\\n\\nAll about the hills the hosts of Mordor raged. The Captains of the West \\nwere foundering in a gathering sea. The sun gleamed red, and under the wings \\nof the Nazgyl the shadows of death fell dark upon the earth. Aragorn stood \\nbeneath his banner, silent and stern, as one lost in thought of things long \\npast or far away; but his eyes gleamed like stars that shine the brighter as \\nthe night deepens. Upon the hill-top stood Gandalf, and he was white and \\ncold and no shadow fell on him. The onslaught of Mordor broke like a wave on \\nthe beleaguered hills, voices roaring like a tide amid the wreck and crash \\nof arms. \\n\\nAs if to his eyes some sudden vision had been given, Gandalf stirred; \\nand he turned, looking back north where the skies were pale and clear. Then \\nhe lifted up his hands and cried in a loud voice ringing above the din: The \\nEagles are coming! And many voices answered crying: The Eagles are \\ncoming! \\n\\nThe Eagles are coming! The hosts of Mordor looked up and wondered what \\nthis \\n\\nsign might mean. \\n\\nThere came Gwaihir the Windlord, and Landroval his brother, greatest of \\nall the Eagles of the North, mightiest of the descendants of old Thorondor, \\nwho built his eyries in the inaccessible peaks of the Encircling Mountains \\nwhen Middle-earth was young. Behind them in long swift lines came all their \\nvassals from the northern mountains, speeding on a gathering wind. Straight \\ndown upon the Nazgyl they bore, stooping suddenly out of the high airs, and \\nthe rush of their wide wings as they passed over was like a gale. \\n\\nBut the Nazgyl turned and fled, and vanished into Mordor\\'s shadows, \\nhearing a sudden terrible call out of the Dark Tower; and even at that \\nmoment all the hosts of Mordor trembled, doubt clutched their hearts, their \\nlaughter failed, their hands shook and their limbs were loosed. The Power \\nthat drove them on and filled them with hate and fury was wavering, its will \\nwas removed from them; and now looking in the eyes of their enemies they \\nsaw \\n\\na deadly light and were afraid. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThen all the Captains of the West cried aloud, for their hearts were \\nfilled with a new hope in the midst of darkness. Out from the beleaguered \\nhills knights of Gondor, Riders of Rohan, D(r)nedain of the North, \\nclose-serried companies, drove against their wavering foes, piercing the \\npress with the thrust of bitter spears. But Gandalf lifted up his arms and \\ncalled once more in a clear voice: \\n\\n\\'Stand, Men of the West! Stand and wait! This is the hour of doom.\\' \\n\\nAnd even as he spoke the earth rocked beneath their feet. Then rising \\nswiftly up, far above the Towers of the Black Gate, high above the \\nmountains, a vast soaring darkness sprang into the sky, flickering with \\nfire. The earth groaned and quaked. The Towers of the Teeth swayed, \\ntottered, and fell down; the mighty rampart crumbled; the Black Gate was \\nhurled in ruin; and from far away, now dim, now growing, now mounting to \\nthe \\n\\nclouds, there came a drumming rumble, a roar, a long echoing roll of ruinous \\nnoise. \\n\\n\\'The realm of Sauron is ended!\\' said Gandalf. \\'The Ring -bearer has \\nfulfilled his Quest.\\' And as the Captains gazed south to the Land of Mordor, \\nit seemed to them that, black against the pall of cloud, there rose a huge \\nshape of shadow, impenetrable, lightning-crowned, filling all the sky. \\nEnormous it reared above the world, and stretched out towards them a vast \\nthreatening hand, terrible but impotent: for even as it leaned over them, a \\ngreat wind took it, and it was all blown away, and passed; and then a hush \\nfell. \\n\\nThe Captains bowed their heads; and when they looked up again, behold! \\ntheir enemies were flying and the power of Mordor was scattering like dust \\nin the wind. As when death smites the swollen brooding thing that inhabits \\ntheir crawling hill and holds them all in sway, ants will wander witless and \\npurposeless and then feebly die, so the creatures of Sauron, ore or troll or \\nbeast spell-enslaved, ran hither and thither mindless; and some slew \\nthemselves, or cast themselves in pits, or fled wailing back to hide in \\nholes and dark lightless places far from hope. But the Men of Rhyn and of \\nHarad, Easterling and Southron, saw the ruin of their war and the great \\nmajesty and glory of the Captains of the West. And those that were deepest \\nand longest in evil servitude, hating the West, and yet were men proud and \\nbold, in their turn now gathered themselves for a last stand of desperate \\nbattle. But the most part fled eastward as they could; and some cast their \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nweapons down and sued for mercy. \\n\\nThen Gandalf, leaving all such matters of battle and command to Aragorn \\nand the other lords, stood upon the hill-top and called; and down to him \\ncame the great eagle, Gwaihir the Windlord, and stood before him. \\n\\n\\'Twice you have borne me, Gwaihir my friend,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Thrice \\nshall pay for all, if you are willing. You will not find me a burden much \\ngreater than when you bore me from Zirak-zigil, where my old life burned \\naway.\\' \\n\\n\\'I would bear you,\\' answered Gwaihir, \\'whither you will, even were you \\nmade of stone.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then come, and let your brother go with us, and some other of your \\nfolk who is most swift! For we have need of speed greater than any wind, \\noutmatching the wings of the Nazgyl.\\' \\n\\n\\'The North Wind blows, but we shall outfly it,\\' said Gwaihir. And he \\nlifted up Gandalf and sped away south, and with him went Landroval, and \\nMeneldor young and swift. And they passed over Udyn and Gorgoroth and \\nsaw \\n\\nall the land in ruin and tumult beneath them, and before them Mount Doom \\nblazing, pouring out its fire. \\n\\n\\'I am glad that you are here with me,\\' said Frodo. \\'Here at the end of \\nall things, Sam.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, I am with you, Master,\\' said Sam, laying Frodo\\'s wounded hand \\ngently to his breast. \\'And you\\'re with me. And the journey\\'s finished. But \\nafter coming all that way I don\\'t want to give up yet. It\\'s not like me, \\nsomehow, if you understand.\\' \\n\\n\\'Maybe not, Sam,\\' said Frodo; \\'but it\\'s like things are in the world. \\n\\nHopes fail. An end comes. We have only a little time to wait now. We are \\nlost in ruin and downfall, and there is no escape.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, Master, we could at least go further from this dangerous place \\nhere, from this Crack of Doom, if that\\'s its name. Now couldn\\'t we? Come, \\nMr. Frodo, let\\'s go down the path at any rate!\\' \\n\\n\\'Very well, Sam. If you wish to go, I\\'ll come,\\' said Frodo; and they \\nrose and went slowly down the winding road; and even as they passed towards \\nthe Mountain\\'s quaking feet, a great smoke and steam belched from the \\nSammath Naur, and the side of the cone was riven open, and a huge fiery \\nvomit rolled in slow thunderous cascade down the eastern mountain-side. \\n\\nFrodo and Sam could go no further. Their last strength of mind and body \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwas swiftly ebbing. They had reached a low ashen hill piled at the \\nMountain\\'s foot; but from it there was no more escape. It was an island now, \\nnot long to endure, amid the torment of Orodruin. All about it the earth \\ngaped, and from deep rifts and pits smoke and fumes leaped up. Behind them \\nthe Mountain was convulsed. Great rents opened in its side. Slow rivers of \\nfire came down the long slopes towards them. Soon they would be engulfed. A \\nrain of hot ash was falling. \\n\\nThey stood now; and Sam still holding his master\\'s hand caressed it. He \\nsighed. \\'What a tale we have been in, Mr. Frodo, haven\\'t we?\\' he said. \\'I \\nwish I could hear it told! Do you think they\\'ll say: Now comes the story of \\nNine-fingered Frodo and the Ring of Doom? And then everyone will hush, like \\nwe did, when in Rivendell they told us the tale of Beren One -hand and the \\nGreat Jewel. I wish I could hear it! And I wonder how it will go on after \\nour part.\\' \\n\\nBut even while he spoke so, to keep fear away until the very last, his \\neyes still strayed north, north into the eye of the wind, to where the sky \\nfar off was clear, as the cold blast, rising to a gale, drove back the \\ndarkness and the ruin of the clouds. \\n\\nAnd so it was that Gwaihir saw them with his keen far-seeing eyes, as \\ndown the wild wind he came, and daring the great peril of the skies he \\ncircled in the air: two small dark figures, forlorn, hand in hand upon a \\nlittle hill, while the world shook under them, and gasped, and rivers of \\nfire drew near. And even as he espied them and came swooping down, he \\nsaw \\n\\nthem fall, worn out, or choked with fumes and heat, or stricken down by \\ndespair at last, hiding their eyes from death. \\n\\nSide by side they lay; and down swept Gwaihir, and down came Landroval \\nand Meneldor the swift; and in a dream, not knowing what fate had befallen \\nthem, the wanderers were lifted up and borne far away out of the darkness \\nand the fire. \\n\\nWhen Sam awoke, he found that he was lying on some soft bed, but over \\nhim gently swayed wide beechen boughs, and through their young leaves \\nsunlight glimmered, green and gold. All the air was full of a sweet mingled \\nscent. \\n\\nHe remembered that smell: the fragrance of Ithilien. \\'Bless me!\\' he \\nmused. \\'How long have I been asleep?\\' For the scent had borne him back to \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe day when he had lit his little fire under the sunny bank; and for a \\nmoment all else between was out of waking memory. He stretched and drew \\na \\n\\ndeep breath. \\'Why, what a dream I\\'ve had!\\' he muttered. \\'I am glad to wake!\\' \\nHe sat up and then he saw that Frodo was lying beside him, and slept \\npeacefully, one hand behind his head, and the other resting upon the \\ncoverlet. It was the right hand, and the third finger was missing. \\n\\nFull memory flooded back, and Sam cried aloud: \\'It wasn\\'t a dream! Then \\nwhere are we?\\' \\n\\nAnd a voice spoke softly behind: \\'In the land of Ithilien, and in the \\nkeeping of the King; and he awaits you.\\' With that Gandalf stood before him, \\nrobed in white, his beard now gleaming like pure snow in the twinkling of \\nthe leafy sunlight. \\'Well, Master Samwise, how do you feel?\\' he said. \\n\\nBut Sam lay back, and stared with open mouth, and for a moment, between \\nbewilderment and great joy, he could not answer. At last he gasped: \\n\\'Gandalf! I thought you were dead! But then I thought I was dead myself. Is \\neverything sad going to come untrue? What\\'s happened to the world?\\' \\n\\n\\'A great Shadow has departed,\\' said Gandalf, and then he laughed and \\nthe sound was like music, or like water in a parched land; and as he \\nlistened the thought came to Sam that he had not heard laughter, the pure \\nsound of merriment, for days upon days without count. It fell upon his ears \\nlike the echo of all the joys he had ever known. But he himself burst into \\ntears. Then, as a sweet rain will pass down a wind of spring and the sun \\nwill shine out the clearer, his tears ceased, and his laughter welled up, \\nand laughing he sprang from his bed. \\n\\n\\'How do I feel?\\' he cried. \\'Well, I don\\'t know how to say it. I feel, I \\nfeel\\' - he waved his arms in the air - \\'I feel like spring after winter, and \\nsun on the leaves; and like trumpets and harps and all the songs I have ever \\nheard!\\' He stopped and he turned towards his master. \\'But how\\'s Mr. Frodo?\\' \\nhe said. \\'Isn\\'t it a shame about his poor hand? But I hope he\\'s all right \\notherwise. He\\'s had a cruel time.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, I am all right otherwise,\\' said Frodo, sitting up and laughing in \\nhis turn. I fell asleep again waiting for you, Sam, you sleepyhead. I was \\nawake early this morning, and now it must be nearly noon.\\' \\n\\n\\'Noon?\\' said Sam, trying to calculate. \\'Noon of what day?\\' \\n\\n\\'The fourteenth of the New Year,\\' said Gandalf; \\'or if you like, the \\neighth day of April in the Shire reckoning. ( But in Gondor the New Year will \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nalways now begin upon the twenty -fifth of March when Sauron fell, and when \\nyou were brought out of the fire to the King. He has tended you, and now he \\nawaits you. You shall eat and drink with him. When you are ready I will lead \\nyou to him.\\' \\n\\nThe King?\\' said Sam. \\'What king, and who is he?\\' \\n\\nThe King of Gondor and Lord of the Western Lands,\\' said Gandalf \\'and \\nhe has taken back all his ancient realm. He will ride soon to his crowning, \\nbut he waits for you.\\' \\n\\n\\'What shall we wear?\\' said Sam; for all he could see was the old and \\ntattered clothes that they had journeyed in, lying folded on the ground \\nbeside their beds. \\n\\n\\'The clothes that you wore on your way to Mordor,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Even \\nthe ore-rags that you bore in the black land; Frodo, shall be preserved. No \\nsilks and linens, nor any armour or heraldry could be more honourable. But \\nlater I will find some other clothes, perhaps.\\' \\n\\nThen he held out his hands to them, and they saw that one shone with \\nlight. \\'What have you got there?\\' Frodo cried. \\'Can it be - ?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, I have brought your two treasures. They were found on Sam when \\nyou were rescued. The Lady Galadriel\\'s gifts: your glass, Frodo, and your \\nbox, Sam. You will be glad to have these safe again.\\' \\n\\nWhen they were washed and clad, and had eaten a light meal, the Hobbits \\nfollowed Gandalf. They stepped out of the beech-grove in which they had \\nlain, and passed on to a long green lawn, glowing in sunshine, bordered by \\nstately dark -leaved trees laden with scarlet blossom. Behind them they could \\nhear the sound of falling water, and a stream ran down before them between \\nflowering banks, until it came to a greenwood at the lawn\\'s foot and passed \\nthen on under an archway of trees, through which they saw the shimmer of \\nwater far away. \\n\\nAs they came to the opening in the wood, they were surprised to see \\nknights in bright mail and tall guards in silver and black standing there, \\nwho greeted them with honour and bowed before them. And then one blew a \\nlong \\n\\ntrumpet, and they went on through the aisle of trees beside the singing \\nstream. So they came to a wide green land, and beyond it was a broad river \\nin a silver haze, out of which rose a long wooded isle, and many ships lay \\nby its shores. But on the field where they now stood a great host was drawn \\nup, in ranks and companies glittering in the sun. And as the Hobbits \\n\\n\\n\\n\\napproached swords were unsheathed, and spears were shaken, and horns and \\ntrumpets sang, and men cried with many voices and in many tongues: \\n\\n\\'Long live the Halflings ! Praise them with great praise! \\n\\nCuio i Pheriain anann! Aglar\\'ni Pheriannath! \\n\\nPraise them with great praise, Frodo and Samwise! \\n\\nDaur a Berhael, Conin en Annyn! Eglerio! \\n\\nPraise them! \\n\\nEglerio! \\n\\nA laita te, laita te! Andave laituvalmet! \\n\\nPraise them! \\n\\nCormacolindor, a laita tbrienna! \\n\\nPraise them! The Ring-bearers, praise them with great praise!\\' \\n\\nAnd so the red blood blushing in their faces and their eyes shining \\nwith wonder, Frodo and Sam went forward and saw that amidst the \\nclamorous \\n\\nhost were set three high-seats built of green turves. Behind the seat upon \\nthe right floated, white on green, a great horse running free; upon the left \\nwas a banner, silver upon blue, a ship swan-prowed faring on the sea; but \\nbehind the highest throne in the midst of all a great standard was spread in \\nthe breeze, and there a white tree flowered upon a sable field beneath a \\nshining crown and seven glittering stars. On the throne sat a mail-clad man, \\na great sword was laid across his knees, but he wore no helm. As they drew \\nnear he rose. And then they knew him, changed as he was, so high and glad of \\nface, kingly, lord of Men, dark-haired with eyes of grey. \\n\\nFrodo ran to meet him, and Sam followed close behind. \\'Well, if that \\nisn\\'t the crown of all!\\' he said. \\'Strider, or I\\'m still asleep!\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, Sam, Strider,\\' said Aragorn. \\'It is a long way, is it not, from \\nBree, where you did not like the look of me? A long way for us all but yours \\nhas been the darkest road.\\' \\n\\nAnd then to Sam\\'s surprise and utter confusion he bowed his knee before \\nthem; and taking them by the hand, Frodo upon his right and Sam upon his \\nleft, he led them to the throne, and setting them upon it, he turned to the \\nmen and captains who stood by and spoke, so that his voice rang over all the \\nhost, crying: \\n\\n\\'Praise them with great praise!\\' \\n\\nAnd when the glad shout had swelled up and died away again, to Sam\\'s \\nfinal and complete satisfaction and pure joy, a minstrel of Gondor stood \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nforth, and knelt, and begged leave to sing. And behold! he said: \\n\\n\\'Lo! lords and knights and men of valour unashamed, kings and princes, \\nand fair people of Gondor, and Riders of Rohan, and ye sons of Elrond, and \\nD(r)nedain of the North, and Elf and Dwarf, and greathearts of the Shire, and \\nall free folk of the West, now listen to my lay. For I will sing to you of \\nFrodo of the Nine Fingers and the Ring of Doom.\\' \\n\\nAnd when Sam heard that he laughed aloud for sheer delight, and he \\nstood up and cried: \\'O great glory and splendour! And all my wishes have \\ncome true!\\' And then he wept. \\n\\nAnd all the host laughed and wept, and in the midst of their merriment \\nand tears the clear voice of the minstrel rose like silver and gold, and all \\nmen were hushed. And he sang to them, now in the Elven-tongue, now in the \\nspeech of the West, until their hearts, wounded with sweet words, \\noverflowed, and their joy was like swords, and they passed in thought out to \\nregions where pain and delight flow together and tears are the very wine of \\nblessedness. \\n\\nAnd at the last, as the Sun fell from the noon and the shadows of the \\ntrees lengthened, he ended. \\'Praise them with great praise!\\' he said and \\nknelt. And then Aragorn stood up, and all the host arose, and they passed to \\npavilions made ready, to eat and drink and make merry while the day lasted. \\n\\nFrodo and Sam were led apart and brought to a tent, and there their old \\nraiment was taken off, but folded and set aside with honour; and clean linen \\nwas given to them. Then Gandalf came and in his arms, to the wonder of \\nFrodo, he bore the sword and the elven-cloak and the mithril-coat that had \\nbeen taken from him in Mordor. For Sam he brought a coat of gilded mail, and \\nhis elven-cloak all healed of the soils and hurts that it had suffered; and \\nthen he laid before them two swords. \\n\\n\\'I do not wish for any sword,\\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'Tonight at least you should wear one,\\' said Gandalf. \\n\\nThen Frodo took the small sword that had belonged to Sam, and had been \\nlaid at his side in Cirith Ungol. \\'Sting I gave to you Sam,\\' he said. \\n\\n\\'No, master! Mr. Bilbo gave it to you, and it goes with his silver \\ncoat; he would not wish anyone else to wear it now.\\' \\n\\nFrodo gave way; and Gandalf, as if he were their esquire, knelt and \\ngirt the sword-belts about them, and then rising he set circlets of silver \\nupon their heads. And when they were arrayed they went to the great feast; \\nand they sat at the King\\'s table with Gandalf, and King Jomer of Rohan, and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe Prince Imrahil and all the chief captains; and there also were Gimli and \\nLegolas. \\n\\nBut when, after the Standing Silence, wine was brought there came in \\ntwo esquires to serve the kings; or so they seemed to be: one was clad in \\nthe silver and sable of the Guards of Minas Tirith, and the other in white \\nand green. But Sam wondered what such young boys were doing in an army \\nof \\n\\nmighty men. Then suddenly as they drew near and he could see them plainly, \\nhe exclaimed: \\n\\n\\'Why, look Mr. Frodo! Look here! Well, if it isn\\'t Pippin. Mr. Peregrin \\nTook I should say, and Mr. Merry! How they have grown! Bless me! But I \\ncan \\n\\nsee there\\'s more tales to tell than ours.\\' \\n\\n\\'There are indeed,\\' said Pippin turning towards him. \\'And we\\'ll begin \\ntelling them, as soon as this feast is ended. In the meantime you can try \\nGandalf. He\\'s not so close as he used to be, though he laughs now more than \\nhe talks. For the present Merry and I are busy. We are knights of the City \\nand of the Mark, as I hope you observe.\\' \\n\\nAt last the glad day ended; and when the Sun was gone and the round \\nMoon rode slowly above the mists of Anduin and flickered through the \\nfluttering leaves, Frodo and Sam sat under the whispering trees amid the \\nfragrance of fair Ithilien; and they talked deep into the night with Merry \\nand Pippin and Gandalf, and after a while Legolas and Gimli joined them. \\nThere Frodo and Sam learned much of all that had happened to the Company \\nafter their fellowship was broken on the evil day at Parth Galen by Rauros \\nFalls; and still there was always more to ask and more to tell. \\n\\nOres, and talking trees, and leagues of grass, and galloping riders, \\nand glittering caves, and white towers and golden halls, and battles, and \\ntall ships sailing, all these passed before Sam\\'s mind until he felt \\nbewildered. But amidst all these wonders he returned always to his \\nastonishment at the size of Merry and Pippin; and he made them stand back to \\nback with Frodo and himself. He scratched his head. \\'Can\\'t understand it at \\nyour age!\\' he said. \\'But there it is: you\\'re three inches taller than you \\nought to he, or I\\'m a dwarf.\\' \\n\\n\\'That you certainly are not,\\' said Gimli. \\'But what did I say? Mortals \\ncannot go drinking ent-draughts and expect no more to come of them than of a \\npot of beer.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Ent-draughts?\\' said Sam. \\'There you go about Ents again; but what they \\nare beats me. Why, it will take weeks before we get all these things sized \\nup!\\' \\n\\n\\'Weeks indeed,\\' said Pippin. \\'And then Frodo will have to be locked up \\nin a tower in Minas Tirith and write it all down. Otherwise he will forget \\nhalf of it, and poor old Bilbo will be dreadfully disappointed.\\' \\n\\nAt length Gandalf rose. \\'The hands of the King are hands of healing, \\ndear friends,\\' he said. \\'But you went to the very brink of death ere he \\nrecalled you, putting forth all his power, and sent you into the sweet \\nforgetfulness of sleep. And though you have indeed slept long and blessedly, \\nstill it is now time to sleep again.\\' \\n\\nAnd not only Sam and Frodo here, said Gimli, but you too, Pippin. I \\nlove you, if only because of the pains you have cost me, which I shall never \\nforget. Nor shall I forget finding you on the hill of the last battle. But \\nfor Gimli the Dwarf you would have been lost then. But at least I know now \\nthe look of a hobbit\\'s foot, though it be all that can be seen under a heap \\nof bodies. And when I heaved that great carcase off you, I made sure you \\nwere dead. I could have, torn out my beard. And it is only a day yet since \\nyou were first up and abroad again. To bed now you go. And so shall I.\\' \\n\\n\\'And I,\\' said Legolas, \\'shall walk in the woods of this fair land, \\nwhich is rest enough. In days to come, if my Elven-lord allows, some of our \\nfolk shall remove hither; and when we come it shall be blessed, for a while. \\nFor a while: a month, a life, a hundred years of Men. But Anduin is near, \\nand Anduin leads down to the Sea. To the Sea! \\n\\nTo the Sea, to the Sea! The white gulls are crying, \\n\\nThe wind is blowing, and the white foam is flying. \\n\\nWest, west away, the round sun is falling. \\n\\nGrey ship, grey ship, do you hear them calling. \\n\\nThe voices of my people that have gone before me? \\n\\nI will leave, I will leave the woods that bore me; \\n\\nFor our days are ending and our years failing. \\n\\nI will pass the wide waters lonely sailing. \\n\\nLong are the waves on the Last Shore falling, \\n\\nSweet are the voices in the Lost Isle calling, \\n\\nIn Eressla, in Elvenhome that no man can discover, \\n\\nWhere the leaves fall not: land of my people for ever!\\' \\n\\nAnd so singing Fegolas went away down the hill. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the others also departed, and Frodo and Sam went to their beds and \\nslept. And in the morning they rose again in hope and peace; and they spent \\nmany days in Ithilien. For the Field of Cormallen, where the host was now \\nencamped was near to Henneth Annyn, and the stream that flowed from its \\nfalls could be heard in the night as it rushed down through its rocky gate, \\nand passed through the flowery meads into the tides of Anduin by the Isle of \\nCair Andros. The hobbits wandered here and there visiting again the places \\nthat they had passed before; and Sam hoped always in some shadow of the \\nwoods or secret glade to catch, maybe, a glimpse of the great Oliphaunt. And \\nwhen he learned that at the siege of Gondor there had been a great number of \\nthese beasts but that they were all destroyed, he thought it a sad loss. \\n\\n\\'Well, one can\\'t be everywhere at once, I suppose,\\' he said. \\'But I \\nmissed a lot, seemingly.\\' \\n\\nIn the meanwhile the host made ready for the return to Minas Tirith. \\n\\nThe weary rested and the hurt were healed. For some had laboured and fought \\nmuch with the remnants of the Easterlings and Southrons, until all were \\nsubdued. And, latest of all, those returned who had passed into Mordor and \\ndestroyed the fortresses in the north of the land. \\n\\nBut at the last when the month of May was drawing near the Captains of \\nthe West set out again; and they went aboard ship with all their men, and \\nthey sailed from Cair Andros down Anduin to Osgiliath; and there they \\nremained for one day; and the day after they came to the green fields of the \\nPelennor and saw again the white towers under tall Mindolluin, the City of \\nthe Men of Gondor, last memory of Westernesse, that had passed through the \\ndarkness and fire to a new day. \\n\\nAnd there in the midst of the fields they set up their pavilions and \\nawaited the morning; for it was the Eve of May, and the King would enter his \\ngates with the rising of the Sun. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 5 . The Steward and the King \\n\\n\\n\\nOver the city of Gondor doubt and great dread had hung. Fair weather \\nand clear sun had seemed but a mockery to men whose days held little hope, \\nand who looked each morning for news of doom. Their lord was dead and \\nburned, dead lay the King of Rohan in their citadel, and the new king that \\nhad come to them in the night was gone again to a war with powers too dark \\nand terrible for any might or valour to conquer. And no news came. After the \\nhost left Morgul Vale and took the northward road beneath the shadow of the \\nmountains no messenger had returned nor any rumour of what was passing in \\nthe brooding East. \\n\\nWhen the Captains were but two days gone, the Lady Jowyn bade the \\nwomen \\n\\nwho tended her to bring her raiment, and she would not be gainsaid, but \\nrose; and when they had clothed her and set her arm in a sling of linen, she \\nwent to the Warden of the Houses of Healing. \\n\\n\\'Sir,\\' she said, \\'I am in great unrest, and I cannot lie longer in \\nsloth.\\' \\n\\n\\'Lady,\\' he answered, \\'you are not yet healed, and I was commanded to \\ntend you with especial care. You should not have risen from your bed for \\nseven days yet, or so I was bidden. I beg you to go back.\\' \\n\\n\\'I am healed,\\' she said, \\'healed at least in body, save my left arm \\nonly, and that is at ease. But I shall sicken anew, if there is naught that \\nI can do. Are there no tidings of war? The women can tell me nothing.\\' \\n\\n\\'There are no tidings,\\' said the Warden, \\'save that the Lords have \\nridden to Morgul Vale; and men say that the new captain out of the North is \\ntheir chief. A great lord is that, and a healer; and it is a thing passing \\nstrange to me that the healing hand should also wield the sword. It is not \\nthus in Gondor now, though once it was so, if old tales be true. But for \\nlong years we healers have only sought to patch the rents made by the men of \\nswords. Though we should still have enough to do without them: the world is \\nfull enough of hurts and mischances without wars to multiply them.\\' \\n\\nIt needs but one foe to breed a war, not two, Master Warden, answered \\nJowyn. \\'And those who have not swords can still die upon them. Would you \\nhave the folk of Gondor gather you herbs only, when the Dark Lord gathers \\n\\n\\n\\n\\narmies? And it is not always good to be healed in body. Nor is it always \\nevil to die in battle, even in bitter pain. Were I permitted, in this dark \\nhour I would choose the latter.\\' \\n\\nThe Warden looked at her. Tall she stood there, her eyes bright in her \\nwhite face, her hand clenched as she turned and gazed out of his window that \\nopened to the East. He sighed and shook his head. After a pause she turned \\nto him again. \\n\\n\\'Is there no deed to do?\\' she said. \\'Who commands in this City?\\' \\n\\n\\'I do not rightly know,\\' he answered. \\'Such things are not my care. \\n\\nThere is a marshal over the Riders of Rohan; and the Lord H(r)rin, I am told, \\ncommands the men of Gondor. But the Lord Laramir is by right the Steward of \\nthe City.\\' \\n\\n\\'Where can I find him?\\' \\n\\n\\'In this house, lady. He was sorely hurt, but is now set again on the \\nway to health. But I do not know--\\' \\n\\n\\'Will you not bring me to him? Then you will know.\\' \\n\\nThe Lord Laramir was walking alone in the garden of the Houses of \\nHealing, and the sunlight warmed him, and he felt life run new in his veins; \\nbut his heart was heavy, and he looked out over the walls eastward. And \\ncoming, the Warden spoke his name, and he turned and saw the Lady Jowyn \\nof \\n\\nRohan; and he was moved with pity, for he saw that she was hurt, and his \\nclear sight perceived her sorrow and unrest. \\n\\n\\'My lord,\\' said the Warden, \\'here is the Lady Jowyn of Rohan. She rode \\nwith the king and was sorely hurt, and dwells now in my keeping. But she is \\nnot content, and she wishes to speak to the Steward of the City.\\' \\n\\n\\'Do not misunderstand him, lord,\\' said Jowyn. \\'It is not lack of care \\nthat grieves me. No houses could be fairer, for those who desire to be \\nhealed. But I cannot lie in sloth, idle, caged. I looked for death in \\nbattle. But I have not died, and battle still goes on.\\' \\n\\nAt a sign from Laramir, the Warden bowed and departed. \\'What would you \\nhave me do, lady?\\' said Laramir. \\'I also am a prisoner of the healers.\\' He \\nlooked at her, and being a man whom pity deeply stirred, it seemed to him \\nthat her loveliness amid her grief would pierce his heart. And she looked at \\nhim and saw the grave tenderness in his eyes, and yet knew, for she was bred \\namong men of war, that here was one whom no Rider of the Mark would \\noutmatch \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nin battle. \\n\\n\\'What do you wish?\\' he said again. \\'If it lies in my power, I will do \\nit.\\' \\n\\n\\'I would have you command this Warden, and bid him let me go,\\' she \\nsaid; but though her words were still proud, her heart faltered, and for the \\nfirst time she doubted herself. She guessed that this tall man, both stern \\nand gentle, might think her merely wayward, like a child that has not the \\nfirmness of mind to go on with a dull task to the end. \\n\\n\\'I myself am in the Warden\\'s keeping,\\' answered Faramir. \\'Nor have I \\nyet taken up my authority in the City. But had I done so, I should still \\nlisten to his counsel, and should not cross his will in matters of his \\ncraft, unless in some great need.\\' \\n\\n\\'But I do not desire healing,\\' she said. \\'I wish to ride to war like my \\nbrother Jomer, or better like Thjoden the king, for he died and has both \\nhonour and peace.\\' \\n\\n\\'It is too late, lady, to follow the Captains, even if you had the \\nstrength,\\' said Faramir. \\'But death in battle may come to us all yet, \\nwilling or unwilling. You will be better prepared to face it in your own \\nmanner, if while there is still time you do as the Healer commanded. You and \\nI, we must endure with patience the hours of waiting.\\' \\n\\nShe did not answer, but as he looked at her it seemed to him that \\nsomething in her softened, as though a bitter frost were yielding at the \\nfirst faint presage of Spring. A tear sprang in her eye and fell down her \\ncheek, like a glistening rain-drop. Her proud head drooped a little. Then \\nquietly, more as if speaking to herself than to him: \\'But the healers would \\nhave me lie abed seven days yet,\\' she said. \\'And my window does not look \\neastward.\\' Her voice was now that of a maiden young and sad. \\n\\nFaramir smiled, though his heart was filled with pity. \\'Your window \\ndoes not look eastward?\\' he said. \\'That can be amended. In this I will \\ncommand the Warden. If you will stay in this house in our care, lady, and \\ntake your rest, then you shall walk in this garden in the sun, as you will; \\nand you shall look east, whither all our hopes have gone. And here you will \\nfind me, walking and waiting, and also looking east. It would ease my care, \\nif you would speak to me, or walk at whiles with me.\\' \\n\\nThen she raised her head and looked him in the eyes again; and a colour \\ncame in her pale face. \\'How should I ease your care, my lord?\\' she said. \\n\\'And I do not desire the speech of living men.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Would you have my plain answer?\\' he said. \\n\\n\\'I would.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then, Jowyn of Rohan, I say to you that you are beautiful. In the \\nvalleys of our hills there are flowers fair and bright, and maidens fairer \\nstill; but neither flower nor lady have I seen till now in Gondor so lovely, \\nand so sorrowful. It may be that only a few days are left ere darkness falls \\nupon our world, and when it comes I hope to face it steadily; but it would \\nease my heart, if while the Sun yet shines, I could see you still. For you \\nand I have both passed under the wings of the Shadow, and the same hand drew \\nus back.\\' \\n\\n\\'Alas, not me, lord!\\' she said. \\'Shadow lies on me still. Look not to \\nme for healing! I am a shieldmaiden and my hand is ungentle. But I thank you \\nfor this at least, that I need not keep to my chamber. I will walk abroad by \\nthe grace of the Steward of the City.\\' And she did him a courtesy and walked \\nback to the house. But Faramir for a long while walked alone in the garden, \\nand his glance now strayed rather to the house than to the eastward walls. \\n\\nWhen he returned to his chamber he called for the Warden, and heard all \\nthat he could tell of the Lady of Rohan. \\n\\n\\'But I doubt not, lord,\\' said the Warden, \\'that you would learn more \\nfrom the Halfling that is with us; for he was in the riding of the king, and \\nwith the Lady at the end, they say.\\' \\n\\nAnd so Merry was sent to Faramir, and while that day lasted they talked \\nlong together, and Faramir learned much, more even than Merry put into \\nwords; and he thought that he understood now something of the grief and \\nunrest of Jowyn of Rohan. And in the fair evening Faramir and Merry walked \\nin the garden, but she did not come. \\n\\nBut in the morning, as Faramir came from the Houses, he saw her, as she \\nstood upon the walls; and she was clad all in white, and gleamed in the sun. \\n\\nAnd he called to her, and she came down, and they walked on the grass or sat \\nunder a green tree together, now in silence, now in speech. And each day \\nafter they did likewise. And the Warden looking from his window was glad in \\nheart, for he was a healer, and his care was lightened; and certain it was \\nthat, heavy as was the dread and foreboding of those days upon the hearts of \\nmen, still these two of his charges prospered and grew daily in strength. \\n\\nAnd so the fifth day came since the Lady Jowyn went first to Faramir; \\nand they stood now together once more upon the walls of the City and looked \\nout. No tidings had yet come, and all hearts were darkened. The weather, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntoo, was bright no longer. It was cold. A wind that had sprung up in the \\nnight was blowing now keenly from the North, and it was rising; but the \\nlands about looked grey and drear. \\n\\nThey were clad in warm raiment and heavy cloaks, and over all the Lady \\nJowyn wore a great blue mantle of the colour of deep summer -night, and it \\nwas set with silver stars about hem and throat. Faramir had sent for this \\nrobe and had wrapped it about her; and he thought that she looked fair and \\nqueenly indeed as she stood there at his side. The mantle was wrought for \\nhis mother, Finduilas of Amroth, who died untimely, and was to him but a \\nmemory of loveliness in far days and of his first grief; and her robe seemed \\nto him raiment fitting for the beauty and sadness of Jowyn. \\n\\nBut she now shivered beneath the starry mantle, and she looked \\nnorthward, above the grey hither lands, into the eye of the cold wind where \\nfar away the sky was hard and clear. \\n\\n\\'What do you look for, Jowyn?\\' said Faramir. \\n\\n\\'Does not the Black Gate lie yonder?\\' said she. \\'And must he not now be \\ncome thither? It is seven days since he rode away.\\' \\n\\n\\'Seven days,\\' said Faramir. \\'But think not ill of me, if I say to you: \\nthey have brought me both a joy and a pain that I never thought to know. Joy \\nto see you; but pain, because now the fear and doubt of this evil time are \\ngrown dark indeed. Jowyn, I would not have this world end now, or lose so \\nsoon what I have found.\\' \\n\\n\\'Lose what you have found, lord?\\' she answered; but she looked at him \\ngravely and her eyes were kind. \\'I know not what in these days you have \\nfound that you could lose. But come, my friend, let us not speak of it! Let \\nus not speak at all! I stand upon some dreadful brink, and it is utterly \\ndark in the abyss before my feet, but whether there is any light behind me I \\ncannot tell. For I cannot turn yet. I wait for some stroke of doom.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, we wait for the stroke of doom,\\' said Faramir. And they said no \\nmore; and it seemed to them as they stood upon the wall that the wind died, \\nand the light failed, and the Sun was bleared, and all sounds in the City or \\nin the lands about were hushed: neither wind, nor voice, nor bird-call, nor \\nrustle of leaf, nor their own breath could be heard; the very beating of \\ntheir hearts was stilled. Time halted. \\n\\nAnd as they stood so, their hands met and clasped, though they did not \\nknow it. And still they waited for they knew not what. Then presently it \\nseemed to them that above the ridges of the distant mountains another vast \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmountain of darkness rose, towering up like a wave that should engulf the \\nworld, and about it lightnings flickered; and then a tremor ran through the \\nearth, and they felt the walls of the City quiver. A sound like a sigh went \\nup from all the lands about them; and their hearts beat suddenly again. \\n\\n\\'It reminds me of N(r)menor,\\' said Faramir, and wondered to hear himself \\nspeak. \\n\\n\\'Of N(r)menor?\\' said Jowyn. \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Faramir, \\'of the land of Westernesse that foundered and of \\nthe great dark wave climbing over the green lands and above the hills, and \\ncoming on, darkness unescapable. I often dream of it.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then you think that the Darkness is coming?\\' said Jowyn. \\'Darkness \\nUnescapable?\\' And suddenly she drew close to him. \\n\\n\\'No,\\' said Faramir, looking into her face. \\'It was but a picture in the \\nmind. I do not know what is happening. The reason of my waking mind tells \\nme \\n\\nthat great evil has befallen and we stand at the end of days. But my heart \\nsays nay; and all my limbs are light, and a hope and joy are come to me that \\nno reason can deny. Jowyn, Jowyn, White Lady of Rohan, in this hour I do not \\nbelieve that any darkness will endure!\\' And he stooped and kissed her brow. \\n\\nAnd so they stood on the walls of the City of Gondor, and a great wind \\nrose and blew, and their hair, raven and golden, streamed out mingling in \\nthe air. And the Shadow departed, and the Sun was unveiled, and light leaped \\nforth; and the waters of Anduin shone like silver, and in all the houses of \\nthe City men sang for the joy that welled up in their hearts from what \\nsource they could not tell. \\n\\nAnd before the Sun had fallen far from the noon out of the East there \\ncame a great Eagle flying, and he bore tidings beyond hope from the Lords of \\nthe West, crying: \\n\\nSing now, ye people of the Tower of Anor, \\nfor the Realm of Sauron is ended for ever, \\nand the Dark Tower is thrown down. \\n\\nSing and rejoice, ye people of the Tower of Guard, \\n\\nfor your watch hath not been in vain, \\n\\nand the Black Gate is broken, \\n\\nand your King hath passed through, \\n\\nand he is victorious. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSing and be glad, all ye children of the West, \\nfor your King shall come again, \\nand he shall dwell among you \\nall the days of your life. \\n\\nAnd the Tree that was withered shall be renewed, \\nand he shall plant it in the high places, \\nand the City shall be blessed. \\n\\nSing all ye people! \\n\\nAnd the people sang in all the ways of the City. \\n\\nThe days that followed were golden, and Spring and Summer joined and \\nmade revel together in the fields of Gondor. And tidings now came by swift \\nriders from Cair Andros of all that was done, and the City made ready for \\nthe coming of the King. Merry was summoned and rode away with the wains \\nthat \\n\\ntook store of goods to Osgiliath and thence by ship to Cair Andros; but \\nFaramir did not go, for now being healed he took upon him his authority and \\nthe Stewardship, although it was only for a little while, and his duty was \\nto prepare for one who should replace him. \\n\\nAnd Jowyn did not go, though her brother sent word begging her to come \\nto the field of Cormallen. And Faramir wondered at this, but he saw her \\nseldom, being busy with many matters; and she dwelt still in the Flouses of \\nFlealing and walked alone in the garden, and her face grew pale again, and it \\nseemed that in all the City she only was ailing and sorrowful. And the \\nWarden of the Houses was troubled, and he spoke to Faramir. \\n\\nThen Faramir came and sought her, and once more they stood on the walls \\ntogether; and he said to her: \\'Jowyn, why do you tarry here, and do not go \\nto the rejoicing in Cormallen beyond Cair Andros, where your brother awaits \\nyou?\\' \\n\\nAnd she said: \\'Do you not know?\\' \\n\\nBut he answered: \\'Two reasons there may be, but which is true, 1 do not \\nknow.\\' \\n\\nAnd she said: \\'I do not wish to play at riddles. Speak plainer!\\' \\n\\n\\'Then if you will have it so, lady,\\' he said: \\'you do not go, because \\nonly your brother called for you, and to look on the Lord Aragorn, Elendil\\'s \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nheir, in his triumph would now bring you no joy. Or because I do not go, and \\nyou desire still to be near me. And maybe for both these reasons, and you \\nyourself cannot choose between them. Jowyn, do you not love me, or will you \\nnot?\\' \\n\\n\\'I wished to be loved by another,\\' she answered. \\'But I desire no man\\'s \\npity.\\' \\n\\n\\'That I know,\\' he said. \\'You desired to have the love of the Lord \\nAragorn. Because he was high and puissant, and you wished to have renown \\nand \\n\\nglory and to be lifted far above the mean things that crawl on the earth. \\n\\nAnd as a great captain may to a young soldier he seemed to you admirable. \\nFor so he is, a lord among men, the greatest that now is. But when he gave \\nyou only understanding and pity, then you desired to have nothing, unless a \\nbrave death in battle. Look at me, Jowyn!\\' \\n\\nAnd Jowyn looked at Faramir long and steadily; and Faramir said: \\'Do \\nnot scorn pity that is the gift of a gentle heart, Jowyn! But I do not offer \\nyou my pity. For you are a lady high and valiant and have yourself won \\nrenown that shall not be forgotten; and you are a lady beautiful, I deem, \\nbeyond even the words of the Elven-tongue to tell. And I love you. Once I \\npitied your sorrow. But now, were you sorrowless, without fear or any lack, \\nwere you the blissful Queen of Gondor, still I would love you. Jowyn, do you \\nnot love me?\\' \\n\\nThen the heart of Jowyn changed, or else at last she understood it. And \\nsuddenly her winter passed, and the sun shone on her. \\n\\nI stand in Minas Anor, the Tower of the Sun, she said; and behold the \\nShadow has departed! I will be a shieldmaiden no longer, nor vie with the \\ngreat Riders, nor take joy only in the songs of slaying. I will be a healer, \\nand love all things that grow and are not barren.\\' And again she looked at \\nFaramir. \\'No longer do I desire to be a queen,\\' she said. \\n\\nThen Faramir laughed merrily. \\'That is well,\\' he said; \\'for I am not a \\nking. Yet I will wed with the White Lady of Rohan, if it be her will. And if \\nshe will, then let us cross the River and in happier days let us dwell in \\nfair Ithilien and there make a garden. All things will grow with joy there, \\nif the White Lady comes.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then must I leave my own people, man of Gondor?\\' she said. \\'And would \\nyou have your proud folk say of you: (There goes a lord who tamed a wild \\nshieldmaiden of the North! Was there no woman of the race ofN(r)menor to \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchoose?(\\' \\n\\n\\'I would,\\' said Faramir. And he took her in his arms and kissed her \\nunder the sunlit sky, and he cared not that they stood high upon the walls \\nin the sight of many. And many indeed saw them and the light that shone \\nabout them as they came down from the walls and went hand in hand to the \\nHouses of Healing. \\n\\nAnd to the Warden of the Houses Faramir said: \\'Here is the Lady Jowyn \\nof Rohan, and now she is healed.\\' \\n\\nAnd the Warden said: \\'Then I release her from my charge and bid her \\nfarewell, and may she suffer never hurt nor sickness again. I commend her to \\nthe care of the Steward of the City, until her brother returns.\\' \\n\\nBut Jowyn said: \\'Yet now that I have leave to depart, I would remain. \\n\\nFor this House has become to me of all dwellings the most blessed.\\' And she \\nremained there until King Jomer came. \\n\\nAll things were now made ready in the City; and there was great \\nconcourse of people, for the tidings had gone out into all parts of Gondor, \\nfrom Min-Rimmon even to Pinnath Gelin and the far coasts of the sea; and all \\nthat could come to the City made haste to come. And the City was filled \\nagain with women and fair children that returned to their homes laden with \\nflowers; and from Dol Amroth came the harpers that harped most skilfully in \\nall the land; and there were players upon viols and upon flutes and upon \\nhorns of silver, and clear-voiced singers from the vales of Lebennin. \\n\\nAt last an evening came when from the walls the pavilions could be seen \\nupon the field, and all night lights were burning as men watched for the \\ndawn. And when the sun rose in the clear morning above the mountains in the \\nEast, upon which shadows lay no more, then all the bells rang, and all the \\nbanners broke and flowed in the wind; and upon the White Tower of the \\ncitadel the standard of the Stewards, bright argent like snow in the sun, \\nbearing no charge nor device, was raised over Gondor for the last time. \\n\\nNow the Captains of the West led their host towards the City, and folk \\nsaw them advance in line upon line, flashing and glinting in the sunrise and \\nrippling like silver. And so they came before the Gateway and halted a \\nfurlong from the walls. As yet no gates had been set up again, but a barrier \\nwas laid across the entrance to the City, and there stood men at arms in \\nsilver and black with long swords drawn. Before the barrier stood Faramir \\nthe Steward, and H(r)rin Warden of the Keys, and other captains of Gondor, and \\nthe Lady Jowyn of Rohan with Elfhelm the Marshal and many knights of the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMark; and upon either side of the Gate was a great press of fair people in \\nraiment of many colours and garlands of flowers. \\n\\nSo now there was a wide space before the walls of Minas Tirith, and it \\nwas hemmed in upon all sides by the knights and the soldiers of Gondor and \\nof Rohan, and by the people of the City and of all parts of the land. A hush \\nfell upon all as out from the host stepped the D(r)nedain in silver and grey; \\nand before them came walking slow the Lord Aragorn. He was clad in black \\nmail girt with silver, and he wore a long mantle of pure white clasped at \\nthe throat with a great jewel of green that shone from afar; but his head \\nwas bare save for a star upon his forehead bound by a slender fillet of \\nsilver. With him were Jomer of Rohan, and the Prince Imrahil, and Gandalf \\nrobed all in white, and four small figures that many men marvelled to see. \\n\\n\\'Nay, cousin! they are not boys,\\' said Ioreth to her kinswoman from \\nImloth Melui, who stood beside her. \\'Those are Periain, out of the far \\ncountry of the Halflings, where they are princes of great fame, it is said. \\n\\nI should know, for I had one to tend in the Houses. They are small, but they \\nare valiant. Why, cousin, one of them went with only his esquire into the \\nBlack Country and fought with the Dark Lord all by himself, and set fire to \\nhis Tower, if you can believe it. At least that is the tale in the City. \\n\\nThat will be the one that walks with our Elf stone. They are dear friends, I \\nhear. Now he is a marvel, the Lord Elfstone: not too soft in his speech, \\nmind you, but he has a golden heart, as the saying is; and he has the \\nhealing hands. (The hands of the king are the hands of a healer(, I said; \\nand that was how it was all discovered. And Mithrandir, he said to me: \\n(Ioreth, men will long remember your words(, and--\\' \\n\\nBut Ioreth was not permitted to continue the instruction of her \\nkinswoman from the country, for a single trumpet rang, and a dead silence \\nfollowed. Then forth from the Gate went Faramir with H(r)rin of the Keys, and \\nno others, save that behind them walked four men in the high helms and \\narmour of the Citadel, and they bore a great casket of black lebethron bound \\nwith silver. \\n\\nFaramir met Aragorn in the midst of those there assembled, and he \\nknelt, and said: \\'The last Steward of Gondor begs leave to surrender his \\noffice.\\' And he held out a white rod; but Aragorn took the rod and gave it \\nback, saying: \\'That office is not ended, and it shall be thine and thy \\nheirs\\' as long as my line shall last. Do now thy office!\\' \\n\\nThen Faramir stood up and spoke in a clear voice: \\'Men of Gondor hear \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnow the Steward of this Realm! Behold! one has come to claim the kingship \\nagain at last. Here is Aragorn son of Arathorn, chieftain of the D(r)nedain of \\nArnor, Captain of the Host of the West, bearer of the Star of the North, \\nwielder of the Sword Reforged, victorious in battle, whose hands bring \\nhealing, the Elf stone, Elessar of the line of Valandil, Isildur\\'s son, \\n\\nElendil\\'s son of N(r)menor. Shall he be king and enter into the City and dwell \\nthere?\\' \\n\\nAnd all the host and all the people cried yea with one voice. \\n\\nAnd Ioreth said to her kinswoman: \\'This is just a ceremony such as we \\nhave in the City, cousin; for he has already entered, as I was telling you; \\nand he said to me--\\' And then again she was obliged to silence, for Faramir \\nspoke again. \\n\\n\\'Men of Gondor, the loremasters tell that it was the custom of old that \\nthe king should receive the crown from his father ere he died; or if that \\nmight not be, that he should go alone and take it from the hands of his \\nfather in the tomb where he was laid. But since things must now be done \\notherwise, using the authority of the Steward, I have today brought hither \\nfrom Rath Dnnen the crown of Edrnur the last king, whose days passed in the \\ntime of our longfathers of old.\\' \\n\\nThen the guards stepped forward, and Faramir opened the casket, and he \\nheld up an ancient crown. It was shaped like the helms of the Guards of the \\nCitadel, save that it was loftier, and it was all white, and the wings at \\neither side were wrought of pearl and silver in the likeness of the wings of \\na sea-bird, for it was the emblem of kings who came over the Sea; and seven \\ngems of adamant were set in the circlet, and upon its summit was set a \\nsingle jewel the light of which went up like a flame. \\n\\nThen Aragorn took the crown and held it up and said: \\n\\nEt Edrello Endorenna ut(r)lien. Sinome maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn\\' \\nAmbar-metta! \\n\\nAnd those were the words that Elendil spoke when he came up out of the \\nSea on the wings of the wind: \\'Out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth I am \\ncome. In this place will I abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the \\nworld.\\' \\n\\nThen to the wonder of many Aragorn did not put the crown upon his head, \\nbut gave it back to Faramir, and said: \\'By the labour and valour of many I \\nhave come into my inheritance. In token of this I would have the Ring -bearer \\nbring the crown to me, and let Mithrandir set it upon my head, if he will; \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfor he has been the mover of all that has been accomplished, and this is his \\nvictory.\\' \\n\\nThen Frodo came forward and took the crown from Faramir and bore it to \\nGandalf; and Aragorn knelt, and Gandalf set the White Crown upon his head, \\nand said: \\n\\n\\'Now come the days of the King, and may they be blessed while the \\nthrones of the Valar endure!\\' \\n\\nBut when Aragorn arose all that beheld him gazed in silence, for it \\nseemed to them that he was revealed to them now for the first time. Tall as \\nthe sea-kings of old, he stood above all that were near; ancient of days he \\nseemed and yet in the flower of manhood; and wisdom sat upon his brow, and \\nstrength and healing were in his hands, and a light was about him. And then \\nFaramir cried: \\n\\n\\'Behold the King!\\' \\n\\nAnd in that moment all the trumpets were blown, and the King Elessar \\nwent forth and came to the barrier, and H(r)rin of the Keys thrust it back; \\nand amid the music of harp and of viol and of flute and the singing of clear \\nvoices the King passed through the flower -laden streets, and came to the \\nCitadel, and entered in; and the banner of the Tree and the Stars was \\nunfurled upon the topmost tower, and the reign of King Elessar began, of \\nwhich many songs have told. \\n\\nIn his time the City was made more fair than it had ever been, even in \\nthe days of its first glory; and it was filled with trees and with \\nfountains, and its gates were wrought of mithril and steel, and its streets \\nwere paved with white marble; and the Folk of the Mountain laboured in it, \\nand the Folk of the Wood rejoiced to come there; and all was healed and made \\ngood, and the houses were filled with men and women and the laughter of \\nchildren, and no window was blind nor any courtyard empty; and after the \\nending of the Third Age of the world into the new age it preserved the \\nmemory and the glory of the years that were gone. \\n\\nIn the days that followed his crowning the King sat on his throne in \\nthe Hall of the Kings and pronounced his judgements. And embassies came \\nfrom \\n\\nmany lands and peoples, from the East and the South, and from the borders of \\nMirkwood, and from Dunland in the west. And the King pardoned the \\nEasterlings that had given themselves up, and sent them away free, and he \\nmade peace with the peoples of Harad; and the slaves of Mordor he released \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand gave to them all the lands about Lake N(r)rnen to be their own. And there \\nwere brought before him many to receive his praise and reward for their \\nvalour; and last the captain of the Guard brought to him Beregond to be \\njudged. \\n\\nAnd the King said to Beregond: \\'Beregond, by your sword blood was \\nspilled in the Hallows, where that is forbidden. Also you left your post \\nwithout leave of Lord or of Captain. For these things, of old, death was the \\npenalty. Now therefore I must pronounce your doom. \\n\\n\\'All penalty is remitted for your valour in battle, and still more \\nbecause all that you did was for the love of the Lord Faramir. Nonetheless \\nyou must leave the Guard of the Citadel, and you must go forth from the City \\nof Minas Tirith.\\' \\n\\nThen the blood left Beregond\\'s face, and he was stricken to the heart \\nand bowed his head. But the King said.: \\n\\n\\'So it must be, for you are appointed to the White Company, the Guard \\nof Faramir, Prince of Ithilien, and you shall be its captain and dwell in \\nEmyn Arnen in honour and peace, and in the service of him for whom you \\nrisked all, to save him from death.\\' \\n\\nAnd then Beregond, perceiving the mercy and justice of the King, was \\nglad, and kneeling kissed his hand, and departed in joy and content. And \\nAragorn gave to Faramir Ithilien to be his princedom, and bade him dwell in \\nthe hills of Emyn Arnen within sight of the City. \\n\\n\\'For,\\' said he, \\'Minas Ithil in Morgul Vale shall be utterly destroyed, \\nand though it may in time to come be made clean, no man may dwell there for \\nmany long years.\\' \\n\\nAnd last of all Aragorn greeted Jomer of Rohan, and they embraced, and \\nAragorn said: \\'Between us there can be no word of giving or taking, nor of \\nreward; for we are brethren. In happy hour did Eorl ride from the North, and \\nnever has any league of peoples been more blessed, so that neither has ever \\nfailed the other, nor shall fail. Now, as you know, we have laid Thjoden the \\nRenowned in a tomb in the Hallows, and there he shall lie for ever among the \\nKings of Gondor, if you will. Or if you desire it, we will come to Rohan and \\nbring him back to rest with his own people.\\' \\n\\nAnd Jomer answered: \\'Since the day when you rose before me out of the \\ngreen grass of the downs I have loved you, and that love shall not fail. But \\nnow I must depart for a while to my own realm, where there is much to heal \\nand set in order. But as for the Fallen, when all is made ready we will \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nreturn for him; but here let him sleep a while.\\' \\n\\nAnd Jowyn said to Faramir: \\'Now I must go back to my own land and look \\non it once again, and help my brother in his labour; but when one whom I \\nlong loved as father is laid at last to rest, I will return.\\' \\n\\nSo the glad days passed; and on the eighth day of May the Riders of \\nRohan made ready, and rode off by the North-way, and with them went the \\nsons \\n\\nof Elrond. All the road was lined with people to do them honour and praise \\nthem, from the Gate of the City to the walls of the Pelennor. Then all \\nothers that dwelt afar went back to their homes rejoicing; but in the City \\nthere was labour of many willing hands to rebuild and renew and to remove \\nall the scars of war and the memory of the darkness. \\n\\nThe hobbits still remained in Minas Tirith, with Legolas and Gimli; for \\nAragorn was loth for the fellowship to be dissolved. \\'At last all such \\nthings must end,\\' he said, \\'but I would have you wait a little while longer: \\nfor the end of the deeds that you have shared in has not yet come. A day \\ndraws near that I have looked for in all the years of my manhood, and when \\nit comes I would have my friends beside me.\\' But of that day he would say no \\nmore. \\n\\nIn those days the Companions of the Ring dwelt together in a fair house \\nwith Gandalf, and they went to and fro as they wished. And Frodo said to \\nGandalf: \\'Do you know what this day is that Aragorn speaks of? For we are \\nhappy here, and I don\\'t wish to go; but the days are running away, and Bilbo \\nis waiting; and the Shire is my home.\\' \\n\\n\\'As for Bilbo,\\' said Gandalf, \\'he is waiting for the same day, and he \\nknows what keeps you. And as for the passing of the days, it is now only May \\nand high summer is not yet in; and though all things may seem changed, as if \\nan age of the world had gone by, yet to the trees and the grass it is less \\nthan a year since you set out.\\' \\n\\n\\'Pippin,\\' said Frodo, \\'didn\\'t you say that Gandalf was less close than \\nof old? Fie was weary of his labours then, I think. Now he is recovering.\\' \\n\\nAnd Gandalf said: \\'Many folk like to know beforehand what is to be set \\non the table; but those who have laboured to prepare the feast like to keep \\ntheir secret; for wonder makes the words of praise louder. And Aragorn \\nhimself waits for a sign.\\' \\n\\nThere came a day when Gandalf could not be found, and the Companions \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwondered what was going forward. But Gandalf took Aragorn out from the \\nCity \\n\\nby night, and he brought him to the southern feet of Mount Mindolluin; and \\nthere they found a path made in ages past that few now dared to tread. For \\nit led up on to the mountain to a high hallow where only the kings had been \\nwont to go. And they went up by steep ways, until they came to a high field \\nbelow the snows that clad the lofty peaks, and it looked down over the \\nprecipice that stood behind the City. And standing there they surveyed the \\nlands, for the morning was come; and they saw the towers of the City far \\nbelow them like white pencils touched by the sunlight, and all the Vale of \\nAnduin was like a garden, and the Mountains of Shadow were veiled in a \\ngolden mist. Upon the one side their sight reached to the grey Emyn Muil, \\nand the glint of Rauros was like a star twinkling far off; and upon the \\nother side they saw the River like a ribbon laid down to Pelargir, and \\nbeyond that was a light on the hem of the sky that spoke of the Sea. \\n\\nAnd Gandalf said: This is your realm, and the heart of the greater \\nrealm that shall be. The Third Age of the world is ended, and the new age is \\nbegun; and it is your task to order its beginning and to preserve what may \\nbe preserved. For though much has been saved, much must now pass away; \\nand \\n\\nthe power of the Three Rings also is ended. And all the lands that you see, \\nand those that lie round about them, shall be dwellings of Men. For the time \\ncomes of the Dominion of Men, and the Elder Kindred shall fade or depart.\\' \\n\\n\\'I know it well, dear friend,\\' said Aragorn; \\'but I would still have \\nyour counsel.\\' \\n\\n\\'Not for long now,\\' said Gandalf. \\'The Third Age was my age. I was the \\nEnemy of Sauron; and my work is finished. I shall go soon. The burden must \\nlie now upon you and your kindred.\\' \\n\\n\\'But I shall die,\\' said Aragorn. \\'For I am a mortal man, and though \\nbeing what I am and of the race of the West unmingled, I shall have life far \\nlonger than other men, yet that is but a little while; and when those who \\nare now in the wombs of women are born and have grown old, I too shall grow \\nold. And who then shall govern Gondor and those who look to this City as to \\ntheir queen, if my desire be not granted? The Tree in the Court of the \\nFountain is still withered and barren. When shall I see a sign that it will \\never be otherwise?\\' \\n\\n\\'Turn your face from the green world, and look where all seems barren \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand cold!\\' said Gandalf. \\n\\nThen Aragorn turned, and there was a stony slope behind him running \\ndown from the skirts of the snow; and as he looked he was aware that alone \\nthere in the waste a growing thing stood. And he climbed to it, and saw that \\nout of the very edge of the snow there sprang a sapling tree no more than \\nthree foot high. Already it had put forth young leaves long and shapely, \\ndark above and silver beneath, and upon its slender crown it bore one small \\ncluster of flowers whose white petals shone like the sunlit snow. \\n\\nThen Aragorn cried: \\'Yj! ut(r)vienyes! I have found it! Lo! here is a \\nscion of the Eldest of Trees! But how comes it here? For it is not itself \\nyet seven years old.\\' \\n\\nAnd Gandalf coming looked at it, and said: \\'Verily this is a sapling of \\nthe line of Nimloth the fair; and that was a seedling of Galathilion, and \\nthat a fruit of Telperion of many names, Eldest of Trees. Who shall say how \\nit comes here in the appointed hour? But this is an ancient hallow, and ere \\nthe kings failed or the Tree withered in the court, a fruit must have been \\nset here. For it is said that, though the fruit of the Tree comes seldom to \\nripeness, yet the life within may then lie sleeping through many long years, \\nand none can foretell the time in which it will awake. Remember this. For if \\never a fruit ripens, it should be planted, lest the line die out of the \\nworld. Flere it has lain, hidden on the mountain, even as the race of Elendil \\nlay hidden in the wastes of the North. Yet the line of Nimloth is older far \\nthan your line, King Elessar.\\' \\n\\nThen Aragorn laid his hand gently to the sapling, and lo! it seemed to \\nhold only lightly to the earth, and it was removed without hurt; and Aragorn \\nbore it back to the Citadel. Then the withered tree was uprooted, but with \\nreverence; and they did not burn it, but laid it to rest in the silence of \\nRath Dnnen. And Aragorn planted the new tree in the court by the fountain, \\nand swiftly and gladly it began to grow; and when the month of June entered \\nin it was laden with blossom. \\n\\n\\'The sign has been given,\\' said Aragorn, \\'and the day is not far off.\\' \\n\\nAnd he set watchmen upon the walls. \\n\\nIt was the day before Midsummer when messengers came from Amon D(n \\nto \\n\\nthe City, and they said that there was a riding of fair folk out of the \\nNorth, and they drew near now to the walls of the Pelennor. And the King \\nsaid: \\'At last they have come. Fet all the City be made ready!\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUpon the very Eve of Midsummer, when the sky was blue as sapphire and \\nwhite stars opened in the East, but the West was still golden and the air \\nwas cool and fragrant, the riders came down the North-way to the gates of \\nMinas Tirith. First rode Elrohir and Elladan with a banner of silver, and \\nthen came Glorfindel and Erestor and all the household of Rivendell, and \\nafter them came the Lady Galadriel and Celeborn, Lord of Lothlurien, riding \\nupon white steeds and with them many fair folk of their land, grey-cloaked \\nwith white gems in their hair; and last came Master Elrond, mighty among \\nElves and Men, bearing the sceptre of Ann(r)minas, and beside him upon a \\ngrey \\n\\npalfrey rode Arwen his daughter, Evenstar of her people. \\n\\nAnd Frodo when he saw her come glimmering in the evening, with stars on \\nher brow and a sweet fragrance about her, was moved with great wonder, and \\nhe said to Gandalf: \\'At last I understand why we have waited! This is the \\nending. Now not day only shall be beloved, but night too shall be beautiful \\nand blessed and all its fear pass away!\\' \\n\\nThen the King welcomed his guests, and they alighted; and Elrond \\nsurrendered the sceptre, and laid the hand of his daughter in the hand of \\nthe King, and together they went up into the High City, and all the stars \\nflowered in the sky. And Aragorn the King Elessar wedded Arwen Undumiel \\nin \\n\\nthe City of the Kings upon the day of Midsummer, and the tale of their long \\nwaiting and labours was come to fulfilment. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 6. Many Partings \\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the days of rejoicing were over at last the Companions thought of \\nreturning to their own homes. And Frodo went to the King as he was sitting \\nwith the Queen Arwen by the fountain, and she sang a song of Valinor, while \\nthe Tree grew and blossomed. They welcomed Frodo and rose to greet him; \\nand \\n\\nAragorn said: \\n\\n\\'I know what you have come to say, Frodo: you wish to return to your \\nown home. Well, dearest friend, the tree grows best in the land of its \\nsires; but for you in all the lands of the West there will ever be a \\nwelcome. And though your people have had little fame in the legends of the \\ngreat, they will now have more renown than any wide realms that are no \\nmore.\\' \\n\\n\\'It is true that I wish to go back to the Shire,\\' said Frodo. \\'But \\nfirst I must go to Rivendell. For if there could be anything wanting in a \\ntime so blessed, I missed Bilbo; and I was grieved when among all the \\nhousehold of Elrond I saw that he was not come.\\' \\n\\n\\'Do you wonder at that, Ring-bearer?\\' said Arwen. \\'For you know the \\npower of that thing which is now destroyed; and all that was done by that \\npower is now passing away. But your kinsman possessed this thing longer than \\nyou. He is ancient in years now, according to his kind; and he awaits you, \\nfor he will not again make any long journey save one.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then I beg leave to depart soon,\\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'In seven days we will go,\\' said Aragorn. \\'For we shall ride with you \\nfar on the road, even as far as the country of Rohan. In three days now \\nJomer will return hither to bear Thjoden back to rest in the Mark, and we \\nshall ride with him to honour the fallen. But now before you go I will \\nconfirm the words that Faramir spoke to you, and you are made free for ever \\nof the realm of Gondor; and all your companions likewise. And if there were \\nany gifts that I could give to match with your deeds you should have them; \\nbut whatever you desire you shall take with you, and you shall ride in \\nhonour and arrayed as princes of the land.\\' \\n\\nBut the Queen Arwen said: \\'A gift I will give you. For I am the \\ndaughter of Elrond. I shall not go with him now when he departs to the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHavens; for mine is the choice of L(r)thien, and as she so have I chosen, both \\nthe sweet and the bitter. But in my stead you shall go, Ring-bearer, when \\nthe time comes, and if you then desire it. If your hurts grieve you still \\nand the memory of your burden is heavy, then you may pass into the West, \\nuntil all your wounds and weariness are healed. But wear this now in memory \\nof Elfstone and Evenstar with whom your life has been woven!\\' \\n\\nAnd she took a white gem like a star that lay upon her breast hanging \\nupon a silver chain, and she set the chain about Frodo\\'s neck. \\'When the \\nmemory of the fear and the darkness troubles you,\\' she said, \\'this will \\nbring you aid.\\' \\n\\nIn three days, as the King had said, Jomer of Rohan came riding to the \\nCity, and with him came an jored of the fairest knights of the Mark. He was \\nwelcomed; and when they sat all at table in Merethrond, the Great Hall of \\nFeasts, he beheld the beauty of the ladies that he saw and was filled with \\ngreat wonder. And before he went to his rest he sent for Gimli the Dwarf, \\nand he said to him: \\'Gimli Gluin\\'s son, have you your axe ready?\\' \\n\\n\\'Nay, lord,\\' said Gimli, \\'but I can speedily fetch it, if there be \\nneed.\\' \\n\\n\\'You shall judge,\\' said Jomer. \\'For there are certain rash words \\nconcerning the Fady in the Golden Wood that lie still between us. And now I \\nhave seen her with my eyes.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, lord,\\' said Gimli, \\'and what say you now?\\' \\n\\n\\'Alas!\\' said Jomer. \\'I will not say that she is the fairest lady that \\nlives.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then I must go for my axe,\\' said Gimli. \\n\\n\\'But first I will plead this excuse,\\' said Jomer. \\'Had I seen her in \\nother company, I would have said all that you could wish. But now I will put \\nQueen Arwen Evenstar first, and I am ready to do battle on my own part with \\nany who deny me. Shall I call for my sword?\\' \\n\\nThen Gimli bowed low. \\'Nay, you are excused for my part, lord,\\' he \\nsaid. \\'You have chosen the Evening; but my love is given to the Morning. And \\nmy heart forebodes that soon it will past away for ever.\\' \\n\\nAt last the day of departure came, and a great and fair company made \\nready to ride north from the City. Then the kings of Gondor and Rohan went \\nto the Hallows and they came to the tombs in Rath Dnnen, and they bore away \\nKing Thjoden upon a golden bier, and passed through the City in silence. \\nThen they laid the bier upon a great wain with Riders of Rohan all about it \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand his banner borne before; and Merry being Thjoden\\'s esquire rode upon the \\nwain and kept the arms of the king. \\n\\nFor the other Companions steeds were furnished according to their \\nstature; and Frodo and Samwise rode at Aragorn\\'s side, and Gandalf rode upon \\nShadowfax, and Pippin rode with the knights of Gondor; and Legolas and \\nGimli \\n\\nas ever rode together upon Arod. \\n\\nIn that riding went also Queen Arwen, and Celeborn and Galadriel with \\ntheir folk, and Elrond and his sons; and the princes of Dol Amroth and of \\nIthilien, and many captains and knights. Never had any king of the Mark such \\ncompany upon the road as went with Thjoden Thengel\\'s son to the land of his \\nhome. \\n\\nWithout haste and at peace they passed into Anurien, and they came to \\nthe Grey Wood under Amon D(n; and there they heard a sound as of drums \\nbeating in the hills, though no living thing could be seen. Then Aragorn let \\nthe trumpets be blown; and heralds cried: \\n\\n\\'Behold the King Elessar is come! The Forest of Dr(r)adan he gives to \\nGhvn-buri-ghvn and to his folk, to be their own for ever; and hereafter let \\nno man enter it without their leave!\\' \\n\\nThen the drums rolled loudly, and were silent. \\n\\nAt length after fifteen days of journey the wain of King Thjoden passed \\nthrough the green fields of Rohan and came to Edoras; and there they all \\nrested. The Golden Hall was arrayed with fair hangings and it was filled \\nwith light, and there was held the highest feast that it had known since the \\ndays of its building. For after three days the Men of the Mark prepared the \\nfuneral of Thjoden; and he was laid in a house of stone with his arms and \\nmany other fair things that he had possessed, and over him was raised a \\ngreat mound, covered with green turves of grass and of white evermind. And \\nnow there were eight mounds on the east -side of the Barrowfield. \\n\\nThen the Riders of the King\\'s House upon white horses rode round about \\nthe barrow and sang together a song of Thjoden Thengel\\'s son that Gljowine \\nhis minstrel made, and he made no other song after. The slow voices of the \\nRiders stirred the hearts even of those who did not know the speech of that \\npeople; but the words of the song brought a light to the eyes of the folk of \\nthe Mark as they heard again afar the thunder of the hooves of the North and \\nthe voice of Eorl crying above the battle upon the Field of Celebrant; and \\nthe tale of the kings rolled on, and the horn of Helm was loud in the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmountains, until the Darkness came and King Thjoden arose and rode through \\nthe Shadow to the fire, and died in splendour, even as the Sun, returning \\nbeyond hope, gleamed upon Mindolluin in the morning. \\n\\nOut of doubt, out of dark, to the day\\'s rising \\nhe rode singing in the sun, sword unsheathing. \\n\\nHope he rekindled, and in hope ended; \\nover death, over dread, over doom lifted \\nout of loss, out of life, unto long glory. \\n\\nBut Merry stood at the foot of the green mound, and he wept, and when \\nthe song was ended he arose and cried: \\n\\n\\'Thjoden King, Thjoden King! Farewell! As a father you were to me. for \\na little while. Farewell!\\' \\n\\nWhen the burial was over and the weeping of women was stilled, and \\nThjoden was left at last alone in his barrow, then folk gathered to the \\nGolden Hall for the great feast and put away sorrow; for Thjoden had lived \\nto full years and ended in honour no less than the greatest of his sires. \\n\\nAnd when the time came that in the custom of the Mark they should drink to \\nthe memory of the kings, Jowyn Lady of Rohan came forth, golden as the sun \\nand white as snow, and she bore a filled cup to Jomer. \\n\\nThen a minstrel and loremaster stood up and named all the names of the \\nLords of the Mark in their order: Eorl the Young; and Brego builder of the \\nHall; and Aldor brother of Baldor the hapless; and Frja, and Frjawine, and \\nGoldwine, and Djor, and Gram; and Helm who lay hid in Helm\\'s Deep when \\nthe \\n\\nMark was overrun; and so ended the nine mounds of the west-side, for in that \\ntime the line was broken, and after came the mounds of the east-side: \\nFrjalaf, Helm s sister-son, and Ljofa, and Walda, and Folca, and Folcwine, \\nand Fengel, and Thengel, and Thjoden the latest. And when Thjoden was \\nnamed \\n\\nJomer drained the cup. Then Jowyn bade those that served to fill the cups, \\nand all there assembled rose and drank to the new king, crying: \\'Hail, \\nJomer, King of the Mark!\\' \\n\\nAt the last when the feast drew to an end Jomer arose and said: \\'Now \\nthis is the funeral feast of Thjoden the King; but I will speak ere we go of \\ntidings of joy, for he would not grudge that I should do so, since he was \\never a father of Jowyn my sister. Hear then all my guests, fair folk of many \\nrealms, such as have never before been gathered in this hall! Faramir, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSteward of Gondor, and Prince of Ithilien, asks that Jowyn Lady of Rohan \\nshould be his wife, and she grants it full willing. Therefore they shall be \\ntrothplighted before you all.\\' \\n\\nAnd Faramir and Jowyn stood forth and set hand in hand; and all there \\ndrank to them and were glad. \\'Thus,\\' said Jomer, \\'is the friendship of the \\nMark and of Gondor bound with a new bond, and the more do I rejoice.\\' \\n\\n\\'No niggard are you, Jomer,\\' said Aragorn, \\'to give thus to Gondor the \\nfairest thing in your realm!\\' \\n\\nThen Jowyn looked in the eyes of Aragorn, and she said: \\'Wish me joy, \\nmy liege-lord and healer!\\' \\n\\nAnd he answered: \\'I have wished thee joy ever since first I saw thee. \\n\\nIt heals my heart to see thee now in bliss.\\' \\n\\nWhen the feast was over, those who were to go took leave of King Jomer. \\nAragorn and his knights, and the people of Lurien and of Ri vendell, made \\nready to ride; but Faramir and Imrahil remained at Edoras; and Arwen \\nEvenstar remained also, and she said farewell to her brethren. None saw her \\nlast meeting with Elrond her father, for they went up into the hills and \\nthere spoke long together, and bitter was their parting that should endure \\nbeyond the ends of the world. \\n\\nAt the last before the guests set oat Jomer and Jowyn came to Merry, \\nand they said: \\'Farewell now, Meriadoc of the Shire and Holdwine of the \\nMark! Ride to good fortune, and ride back soon to our welcome!\\' \\n\\nAnd Jomer said: \\'Kings of old would have laden you with gifts that a \\nwain could not bear for your deeds upon the fields of Mundburg; and yet you \\nwill take naught, you say, but the arms that were given to you. This I \\nsuffer, for indeed I have no gift that is worthy; but my sister begs you to \\nreceive this small thing, as a memorial of Dernhelm and of the horns of the \\nMark at the coming of the morning.\\' \\n\\nThen Jowyn gave to Merry an ancient horn, small but cunningly wrought \\nall of fair silver with a baldric of green; and wrights had engraven upon it \\nswift horsemen riding in a line that wound about it from the tip to the \\nmouth; and there were set runes of great virtue. \\n\\n\\'This is an heirloom of our house,\\' said Jowyn. \\'It was made by the \\nDwarves, and came from the hoard of Scatha the Worm. Eorl the Young \\nbrought \\n\\nit from the North. He that blows it at need shall set fear in the hearts of \\nhis enemies and joy in the hearts of his friends, and they shall hear him \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand come to him.\\' \\n\\nThen Merry took the horn, for it could not be refused, and he kissed \\nJowyn\\'s hand; and they embraced him, and so they parted for that time. \\n\\nNow the guests were ready, and they drank the stirrup-cup, and with \\ngreat praise and friendship they departed, and came at length to Helm\\'s \\nDeep, and there they rested two days. Then Legolas repaid his promise to \\nGimli and went with him to the Glittering Caves; and when they returned he \\nwas silent, and would say only that Gimli alone could find fit words to \\nspeak of them. \\'And never before has a Dwarf claimed a victory over an Elf \\nin a contest of words,\\' said he. \\'Now therefore let us go to Fangorn and set \\nthe score right!\\' \\n\\nFrom Deeping-coomb they rode to Isengard, and saw how the Ents had \\nbusied themselves. All the stone-circle had been thrown down and removed, \\nand the land within was made into a garden filled with orchards and trees, \\nand a stream ran through it; but in the midst of all there was a lake of \\nclear water, and out of it the Tower of Orthanc rose still, tall and \\nimpregnable, and its black rock was mirrored in the pool. \\n\\nFor a while the travellers sat where once the old gates of Isengard had \\nstood, and there were now two tall trees like sentinels at the beginning of \\na green -bordered path that ran towards Orthanc; and they looked in wonder at \\nthe work that had been done, but no living thing could they see far or near. \\nBut presently they heard a voice calling hoom-hom, hoom-hom; and there \\ncame \\n\\nTreebeard striding down the path to greet them with Quickbeam at his side. \\n\\n\\'Welcome to the Treegarth of Orthanc!\\' he said. \\'I knew that you were \\ncoming, but I was at work up the valley; there is much still to be done. But \\nyou have not been idle either away in the south and the east, I hear; and \\nall that I hear is good, very good.\\' Then Treebeard praised all their deeds, \\nof which he seemed to have full knowledge; and at last he stopped and looked \\nlong at Gandalf . \\n\\n\\'Well, come now!\\' he said. \\'You have proved mightiest, and all your \\nlabours have gone well. Where now would you be going? And why do you \\ncome \\nhere?\\' \\n\\n\\'To see how your work goes, my friend,\\' said Gandalf, \\'and to thank you \\nfor your aid in all that has been achieved.\\' \\n\\n\\'Hoom, well, that is fair enough,\\' said Treebeard; \\'for to be sure Ents \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhave played their part. And not only in dealing with that, hoom, that \\naccursed tree-slayer that dwelt here. For there was a great inrush of those, \\nburbrum, those evileyed - blackhanded - bowlegged - flinthearted - \\nclawfingered - foulbellied - bloodthirsty, morimciite - sincahonda, hoom , \\nwell, since you are hasty folk and their full name is as long as years of \\ntorment, those vermin of ores; and they came over the River and down from \\nthe North and all round the wood of Laurelindurenan, which they could not \\nget into, thanks to the Great ones who are here.\\' He bowed to the Lord and \\nLady of Lurien. \\n\\n\\'And these same foul creatures were more than surprised to meet us out \\non the Wold, for they had not heard of us before; though that might be said \\nalso of better folk. And not many will remember us, for not many escaped us \\nalive, and the River had most of those. But it was well for you, for if they \\nhad not met us, then the king of the grassland would not have ridden far, \\nand if he had there would have been no home to return to.\\' \\n\\n\\'We know it well,\\' said Aragorn, \\'and never shall it be forgotten in \\nMinas Tirith or in Edoras.\\' \\n\\n\\' Never is too long a word even for me,\\' said Treebeard. \\'Not while your \\nkingdoms last, you mean; but they will have to last long indeed to seem long \\nto Ents.\\' \\n\\n\\'The New Age begins,\\' said Gandalf, \\'and in this age it may well prove \\nthat the kingdoms of Men shall outlast you, Fangorn my friend. But now come \\ntell me: what of the task that I set you? How is Saruman? Is he not weary of \\nOrthanc yet? For I do not suppose that he will think you have improved the \\nview from his windows.\\' \\n\\nTreebeard gave Gandalf a long look, a most cunning look, Merry thought. \\n\\'Ah!\\' he said. \\'I thought you would come to that. Weary of Orthanc? Very \\nweary at last; but not so weary of his tower as he was weary of my voice. \\nHooml I gave him some long tales, or at least what might be thought long in \\nyour speech.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then why did he stay to listen? Did you go into Orthanc?\\' asked \\nGandalf. \\n\\n\\'Hoom, no, not into Orthanc!\\' said Treebeard. \\'But he came to his \\nwindow and listened, because he could not get news in any other way, and \\nthough he hated the news, he was greedy to have it; and I saw that he heard \\nit all. But I added a great many things to the news that it was good for him \\nto think of. He grew very weary. He always was hasty. That was his ruin.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1 observe, my good Fangorn,\\' said Gandalf, \\'that with great care you \\nsay dwelt, was, grew. What about is? Is he dead?\\' \\n\\n\\'No, not dead, so far as I know,\\' said Treebeard. \\'But he is gone. Yes, \\nhe is gone seven days. I let him go. There was little left of him when he \\ncrawled out, and as for that worm-creature of his, he was like a pale \\nshadow. Now do not tell me, Gandalf, that I promised to keep him safe; for I \\nknow it. But things have changed since then. And I kept him until he was \\nsafe, safe from doing any more harm. You should know that above all I hate \\nthe caging of live things, and I will not keep even such creatures as these \\ncaged beyond great need. A snake without fangs may crawl where he will.\\' \\n\\n\\'You may be right,\\' said Gandalf; \\'but this snake had still one tooth \\nleft, I think. He had the poison of his voice, and I guess that he persuaded \\nyou, even you Treebeard, knowing the soft spot in your heart. Well, he is \\ngone, and there is no more to be said. But the Tower of Orthanc now goes \\nback to the King, to whom it belongs. Though maybe he will not need it.\\' \\n\\n\\'That will be seen later,\\' said Aragorn. \\'But I will give to Ents all \\nthis valley to do with as they will, so long as they keep a watch upon \\nOrthanc and see that none enter it without my leave.\\' \\n\\n\\'It is locked,\\' said Treebeard. \\'I made Saruman lock it and give me the \\nkeys. Quickbeam has them.\\' \\n\\nQuickbeam bowed like a tree bending in the wind and handed to Aragorn \\ntwo great black keys of intricate shape, joined by a ring of steel. \\'Now I \\nthank you once more,\\' said Aragorn, \\'and I bid you farewell. May your forest \\ngrow again in peace. When this valley is filled there is room and to spare \\nwest of the mountains, where once you walked long ago.\\' \\n\\nTreebeard\\'s face became sad. \\'Forests may grow,\\' he said. \\'Woods may \\nspread. But not Ents. There are no Entings.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yet maybe there is now more hope in your search,\\' said Aragorn. \\'Lands \\nwill lie open to you eastward that have long been closed.\\' \\n\\nBut Treebeard shook his head and said: \\'It is far to go. And there are \\ntoo many Men there in these days. But I am forgetting my manners! Will you \\nstay here and rest a while? And maybe there are some that would be pleased \\nto pass through Fangorn Forest and so shorten their road home?\\' He looked at \\nCeleborn and Galadriel. \\n\\nBut all save Legolas said that they must now take their leave and \\ndepart, either south or west. \\'Come, Gimli!\\' said Legolas. \\'Now by Fangorn\\'s \\nleave I will visit the deep places of the Entwood and see such trees as are \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnowhere else to be found in Middle-earth. You shall come with me and keep \\nyour word; and thus we will journey on together to our own lands in Mirkwood \\nand beyond.\\' To this Gimli agreed, though with no great delight, it seemed. \\n\\n\\'Here then at last comes the ending of the Fellowship of the Ring,\\' \\nsaid Aragorn. \\'Yet I hope that ere long you will return to my land with the \\nhelp that you promised.\\' \\n\\n\\'We will come, if our own lords allow it,\\' said Gimli. \\'Well, farewell, \\nmy hobbits! You should come safe to your own homes now, and I shall not be \\nkept awake for fear of your peril. We will send word when we may, and some \\nof us may yet meet at times; but I fear that we shall not all be gathered \\ntogether ever again.\\' \\n\\nThen Treebeard said farewell to each of them in turn, and he bowed \\nthree times slowly and with great reverence to Celeborn and Galadriel. \\'It \\nis long, long since we met by stock or by stone, A vanimar, vanimblion \\nnostari!\\' he said. \\'It is sad that we should meet only thus at the ending. \\n\\nFor the world is changing: I feel it in the water, I feel it in the earth, \\nand I smell it in the air. I do not think we shall meet again.\\' \\n\\nAnd Celeborn said: \\'I do not know, Eldest.\\' But Galadriel said: \\'Not in \\nMiddle -earth, nor until the lands that lie under the wave are lifted up \\nagain. Then in the willow-meads of Tasarinan we may meet in the Spring. \\nFarewell!\\' \\n\\nLast of all Merry and Pippin said good-bye to the old Ent, and he grew \\ngayer as he looked at them. \\'Well, my merry folk,\\' he said, \\'will you drink \\nanother draught with me before you go?\\' \\n\\n\\'Indeed we will,\\' they said, and he took them aside into the shade of \\none of the trees, and there they saw that a great stone jar had been set. \\n\\nAnd Treebeard filled three bowls, and they drank; and they saw his strange \\neyes looking at them over the rim of his bowl. \\'Take care take care!\\' he \\nsaid. \\'For you have already grown since I saw you last.\\' And they laughed \\nand drained their bowls. \\n\\n\\'Well, good-bye!\\' he said. \\'And don\\'t forget that if you hear any news \\nof the Entwives in your land, you will send word to me.\\' Then he waved his \\ngreat hands to all the company and went off into the trees. \\n\\nThe travellers now rode with more speed, and they made their way \\ntowards the Gap of Rohan; and Aragorn took leave of them at last close to \\nthat very place where Pippin had looked into the Stone of Orthanc. The \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHobbits were grieved at this parting; for Aragorn had never failed them and \\nhe had been their guide through many perils. \\n\\n\\'I wish we could have a Stone that we could see all our friends in,\\' \\nsaid Pippin, \\'and that we could speak to them from far away!\\' \\n\\n\\'Only one now remains that you could use,\\' answered Aragorn for you \\nwould not wish to see what the Stone of Minas Tirith would show you. But the \\nPalantnr of Orthanc the King will keep, to see what is passing in his realm, \\nand what his servants are doing. For do not forget, Peregrin Took, that you \\nare a knight of Gondor, and I do not release you from your service. You are \\ngoing now on leave, but I may recall you. And remember, dear friends of the \\nShire, that my realm lies also in the North, and I shall come there one \\nday.\\' \\n\\nThen Aragorn took leave of Celeborn and Galadriel; and the Lady said to \\nhim: \\'Elfstone, through darkness you have come to your hope, and have now \\nall your desire. Use well the days!\\' \\n\\nBut Celeborn said: \\'Kinsman, farewell! May your doom be other than \\nmine, and your treasure remain with you to the end!\\' \\n\\nWith that they parted, and it was then the time of sunset; and when \\nafter a while they turned and looked back, they saw the King of the West \\nsitting upon his horse with his knights about him; and the falling Sun shone \\nupon them and made all their harness to gleam like red gold, and the white \\nmantle of Aragorn was turned to a flame. Then Aragorn took the green stone \\nand held it up, and there came a green fire from his hand. \\n\\nSoon the dwindling company, following the Isen, turned west and rode \\nthrough the Gap into the waste lands beyond, and then they turned \\nnorthwards, and passed over the borders of Dunland. The Dunlendings fled and \\nhid themselves, for they were afraid of Elvish Folk, though few indeed ever \\ncame to their country; but the travellers did not heed them, for they were \\nstill a great company and were well provided with all that they needed; and \\nthey went on their way at their leisure, setting up their tents when they \\nwould. \\n\\nOn the sixth day since their parting from the King they journeyed \\nthrough a wood climbing down from the hills at the feet of the Misty \\nMountains that now marched on their right hand. As they came out again into \\nthe open country at sundown they overtook an old man leaning on a staff, and \\nhe was clothed in rags of grey or dirty white, and at his heels went another \\nbeggar, slouching and whining. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Well Saruman!\\' said Gandalf. \\'Where are you going?\\' \\n\\n\\'What is that to you?\\' he answered. \\'Will you still order my goings, \\nand are you not content with my ruin?\\' \\n\\n\\'You know the answers,\\' said Gandalf: \\'no and no. But in any case the \\ntime of my labours now draws to an end. The King has taken on the burden. If \\nyou had waited at Orthanc, you would have seen him, and he would have \\nshown \\n\\nyou wisdom and mercy.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then all the A more reason to have left sooner,\\' said Saruman; \\'for I \\ndesire neither of him. Indeed if you wish for an answer to your first \\nquestion, I am seeking a way out of his realm.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then once more you are going the wrong way,\\' said Gandalf, \\'and I see \\nno hope in your journey. But will you scorn our help? For we offer it to \\nyou.\\' \\n\\n\\'To me?\\' said Saruman. \\'Nay, pray do not smile at me! I prefer your \\nfrowns. And as for the Lady here, I do not trust her: she always hated me, \\nand schemed for your part. I do not doubt that she has brought you this way \\nto have the pleasure of gloating over my poverty. Had I been warned of your \\npursuit, I would have denied you the pleasure.\\' \\n\\n\\'Saruman,\\' said Galadriel, \\'we have other errands and other cares that \\nseem to us more urgent than hunting for you. Say rather that you are \\novertaken by good fortune; for now you have a last chance.\\' \\n\\n\\'If it be truly the last, I am glad,\\' said Saruman; \\'for I shall be \\nspared the trouble of refusing it again. All my hopes are ruined, but I \\nwould not share yours. If you have any.\\' \\n\\nFor a moment his eyes kindled. \\'Go!\\' he said. \\'I did not spend long \\nstudy on these matters for naught. You have doomed yourselves, and you \\nknow \\n\\nit. And it will afford me some comfort as I wander to think that you pulled \\ndown your own house when you destroyed mine. And now, what ship will \\nbear \\n\\nyou back across so wide a sea?\\' he mocked. \\'It will be a grey ship, and full \\nof ghosts.\\' He laughed, but his voice was cracked and hideous. \\n\\n\\'Get up, you idiot!\\' he shouted to the other beggar, who had sat down \\non the ground; and he struck him with his staff. \\'Turn about! If these fine \\nfolk are going our way, then we will take another. Get on, or I\\'ll give you \\nno crust for your supper!\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe beggar turned and slouched past whimpering: \\'Poor old Grnma! Poor \\nold Grnma! Always beaten and cursed. How I hate him! I wish I could leave \\nhim!\\' \\n\\n\\'Then leave him!\\' said Gandalf. \\n\\nBut Wormtongue only shot a glance of his bleared eyes full of terror at \\nGandalf, and then shuffled quickly past behind Saruman. As the wretched pair \\npassed by the company they came to the hobbits, and Saruman stopped and \\nstared at them; but they looked at him with pity. \\n\\n\\'So you have come to gloat too, have you, my urchins?\\' he said. \\'You \\ndon\\'t care what a beggar lacks, do you? For you have all you want, food and \\nfine clothes, and the best weed for your pipes. Oh yes, I know! I know where \\nit comes from. You would not give a pipeful to a beggar, would you?\\' \\n\\n\\'I would, if I had any,\\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'You can have what I have got left,\\' said Merry, \\'if you will wait a \\nmoment.\\' He got down and searched in the bag at his saddle. Then he handed \\nto Saruman a leather pouch. \\'Take what there is,\\' he said. \\'You are welcome \\nto it; it came from the flotsam of Isengard.\\' \\n\\n\\'Mine, mine, yes and dearly bought!\\' cried Saruman, clutching at the \\npouch. \\'This is only a repayment in token; for you took more, I\\'ll be bound. \\nStill, a beggar must be grateful, if a thief returns him even a morsel of \\nhis own. Well, it will serve you right when you come home, if you find \\nthings less good in the Southfarthing than you would like. Long may your \\nland be short of leaf!\\' \\n\\n\\'Thank you!\\' said Merry. \\'In that case I will have my pouch back, which \\nis not yours and has journeyed far with me. Wrap the weed in a rag of your \\nown.\\' \\n\\n\\'One thief deserves another,\\' said Saruman, and turned his back on \\nMerry, and kicked Wormtongue, and went away towards the wood. \\n\\n\\'Well, I like that!\\' said Pippin. \\'Thief indeed! What of our claim for \\nwaylaying, wounding, and ore-dragging us through Rohan?\\' \\n\\n\\'Ah!\\' said Sam. \\'And bought he said. How, I wonder? And I didn\\'t like \\nthe sound of what he said about the Southfarthing. It\\'s time we got back.\\' \\n\\n\\'I\\'m sure it is,\\' said Frodo. \\'But we can\\'t go any quicker, if we are \\nto see Bilbo. I am going to Rivendell first, whatever happens.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, I think you had better do that,\\' said Gandalf. \\'But alas for \\nSaruman! I fear nothing more can be made of him. He has withered altogether. \\nAll the same, I am not sure that Treebeard is right: I fancy he could do \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsome mischief still in a small mean way.\\' \\n\\nNext day they went on into northern Dunland, where no men now dwelt, \\nthough it was a green and pleasant country. September came in with golden \\ndays and silver nights, and they rode at ease until they reached the \\nSwanfleet river, and found the old ford, east of the falls where it went \\ndown suddenly into the lowlands. Far to the west in a haze lay the meres and \\neyots through which it wound its way to the Greyflood: there countless swans \\nhoused in a land of reeds. \\n\\nSo they passed into Eregion, and at last a fair morning dawned, \\nshimmering above gleaming mists; and looking from their camp on a low hill \\nthe travellers saw away in the east the Sun catching three peaks that thrust \\nup into the sky through floating clouds: Caradhras, Celebdil, and Fanuidhol. \\nThey were near to the Gates of Moria. \\n\\nHere now for seven days they tarried, for the time was at hand for \\nanother parting which they were loth to make. Soon Celeborn and Galadriel \\nand their folk would turn eastward, and so pass by the Redhorn Gate and down \\nthe Dimrill Stair to the Silverlode and to their own country. They had \\njourneyed thus far by the west-ways, for they had much to speak of with \\nElrond and with Gandalf, and here they lingered still in converse with their \\nfriends. Often long after the hobbits were wrapped in sleep they would sit \\ntogether under the stars, recalling the ages that were gone and all their \\njoys and labours in the world, or holding council, concerning the days to \\ncome. If any wanderer had chanced to pass, little would he have seen or \\nheard, and it would have seemed to him only that he saw grey figures, carved \\nin stone, memorials of forgotten things now lost in unpeopled lands. For \\nthey did not move or speak with mouth, looking from mind to mind; and only \\ntheir shining eyes stirred and kindled as their thoughts went to and fro. \\n\\nBut at length all was said, and they parted again for a while, until it \\nwas time for the Three Rings to pass away. Quickly fading into the stones \\nand the shadows the grey-cloaked people of Lurien rode towards the \\nmountains; and those who were going to Rivendell sat on the hill and \\nwatched, until there came out of the gathering mist a flash; and then they \\nsaw no more. Frodo knew that Galadriel had held aloft her ring in token of \\nfarewell. \\n\\nSam turned away and sighed: \\'I wish I was going back to Lurien!\\' \\n\\nAt last one evening they came over the high moors, suddenly as to \\ntravellers it always seemed, to the brink of the deep valley of Rivendell \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand saw far below the lamps shining in Elrond\\'s house. And they went down \\nand crossed the bridge and came to the doors, and all the house was filled \\nwith light and song for joy at Elrond\\'s homecoming. \\n\\nFirst of all, before they had eaten or washed or even shed their \\ncloaks, the hobbits went in search of Bilbo. They found him all alone in his \\nlittle room. It was littered with papers and pens and pencils; but Bilbo was \\nsitting in a chair before a small bright fire. He looked very old, but \\npeaceful, and sleepy. \\n\\nHe opened his eyes and looked up as they came in. \\'Hullo, hullo!\\' he \\nsaid. \\'So you\\'ve come back? And tomorrow\\'s my birthday, too. How clever of \\nyou! Do you know, I shall be one hundred and twenty -nine? And in one year \\nmore, if I am spared, I shall equal the Old Took. I should like to beat him; \\nbut we shall see.\\' \\n\\nAfter the celebration of Bilbo\\'s birthday the four hobbits stayed in \\nRivendell for some days, and they sat much with their old friend, who spent \\nmost of his time now in his room, except at meals. For these he was still \\nvery punctual as a rule, and he seldom failed to wake up in time for them. \\nSitting round the fire they told him in turn all that they could remember of \\ntheir journeys and adventures. At first he pretended to take some notes; but \\nhe often fell asleep; and when he woke he would say: \\'How splendid! How \\nwonderful! But where were we?\\' Then they went on with the story from the \\npoint where he had begun to nod. \\n\\nThe only part that seemed really to rouse him and hold his attention \\nwas the account of the crowning and marriage of Aragorn. \\'I was invited to \\nthe wedding of course,\\' he said. \\'And I have waited for it long enough. But \\nsomehow, when it came to it, I found I had so much to do here; and packing \\nis such a bother.\\' \\n\\nWhen nearly a fortnight had passed Frodo looked out of his window and \\nsaw that there had been a frost in the night, and the cobwebs were like \\nwhite nets. Then suddenly he knew that he must go, and say good-bye to \\nBilbo. The weather was still calm and fair, after one of the most lovely \\nsummers that people could remember; but October had come, and it must \\nbreak \\n\\nsoon and begin to rain and blow again. And there was still a very long way \\nto go. Yet it was not really the thought of the weather that stirred him. He \\nhad a feeling that it was time he went back to the Shire. Sam shared it. \\n\\nOnly the night before he had said: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Well, Mr. Frodo, we\\'ve been far and seen a deal, and yet I don\\'t think \\nwe\\'ve found a better place than this. There\\'s something of everything here, \\nif you understand me: the Shire and the Golden Wood and Gondor and kings\\' \\nhouses and inns and meadows and mountains all mixed. And yet, somehow, \\n\\nI \\n\\nfeel we ought to be going soon. I\\'m worried about my gaffer, to tell you the \\ntruth.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, something of everything, Sam, except the Sea,\\' Frodo had \\nanswered; and he repeated it now to himself: \\'Except the Sea.\\' \\n\\nThat day Frodo spoke to Elrond, and it was agreed that they should \\nleave the next morning. To their delight Gandalf said: \\'I think I shall come \\ntoo. At least as far as Bree. I want to see Butterbur.\\' \\n\\nIn the evening they went to say good-bye to Bilbo. \\'Well, if you must \\ngo, you must,\\' he said. \\'I am sorry. I shall miss you. It is nice just to \\nknow that you are about the place. But I am getting very sleepy.\\' Then he \\ngave Frodo his mithril-coat and Sting, forgetting that he had already done \\nso; and he gave him also three books of lore that he had made at various \\ntimes, written in his spidery hand, and labelled on their red backs: \\nTranslations from the Elvish, by B.B. \\n\\nTo Sam he gave a little bag of gold. \\'Almost the last drop of the Smaug \\nvintage,\\' he said. May come in useful, if you think of getting married, \\n\\nSam.\\' Sam blushed. \\n\\n\\'I have nothing much to give to you young fellows,\\' he said to Merry \\nand Pippin, \\'except good advice.\\' And when he had given them a fair sample \\nof this, he added a last item in Shire-fashion: \\'Don\\'t let your heads get \\ntoo big for your hats! But if you don\\'t finish growing up soon, you are \\ngoing to find hats and clothes expensive.\\' \\n\\n\\'But if you want to beat the Old Took,\\' said Pippin, \\'I don\\'t see why \\nwe shouldn\\'t try and beat the Bullroarer.\\' \\n\\nBilbo laughed, and he produced out of a pocket two beautiful pipes with \\npearl mouth-pieces and bound with fine-wrought silver. \\'Think of me when you \\nsmoke them!\\' he said. \\'The Elves made them for me, but I don\\'t smoke now.\\' \\nAnd then suddenly he nodded and went to sleep for a little; and when he woke \\nup again he said: \\'Now where were we? Yes, of course, giving presents. Which \\nreminds me: what\\'s become of my ring, Frodo, that you took away?\\' \\n\\n\\'I have lost it, Bilbo dear,\\' said Frodo. \\'I got rid of it, you know.\\' \\n\\n\\'What a pity!\\' said Bilbo. \\'I should have liked to see it again. But \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nno, how silly of me! That\\'s what you went for, wasn\\'t it: to get rid of it? \\n\\nBut it is all so confusing, for such a lot of other things seem to have got \\nmixed up with it: Aragorn\\'s affairs, and the White Council and Gondor, and \\nthe Horsemen, and Southrons, and oliphaunts - did you really see one, Sam? - \\nand caves and towers and golden trees, and goodness knows what besides. \\n\\n\\'I evidently came back by much too straight a road from my trip. I \\nthink Gandalf might have shown me round a bit. But then the auction would \\nhave been over before I got back, and I should have had even more trouble \\nthan I did. Anyway it\\'s too late now; and really I think it\\'s much more \\ncomfortable to sit here and hear about it all. The fire\\'s very cosy here, \\nand the food\\'s very good, and there are Elves when you want them. What more \\ncould one want? \\n\\nThe Road goes ever on and on \\nOut from the door where it began. \\n\\nNow far ahead the Road has gone, \\n\\nLet others follow it who can! \\n\\nLet them a journey new begin, \\n\\nBut I at last with weary feet \\nWill turn towards the lighted inn, \\n\\nMy evening-rest and sleep to meet. \\' \\n\\nAnd as Bilbo murmured the last words his head dropped on his chest and \\nhe slept soundly. \\n\\nThe evening deepened in the room, and the firelight burned brighter; \\nand they looked at Bilbo as he slept and saw that his face was smiling. For \\nsome time they sat in silence; and then Sam looking round at the room and \\nthe shadows flickering on the walls, said softly: \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t think, Mr. Frodo, that he\\'s done much writing while we\\'ve been \\naway. He won\\'t ever write our story now.\\' \\n\\nAt that Bilbo opened an eye, almost as if he had heard. Then he roused \\nhimself. \\'You see, I am getting so sleepy,\\' he said. \\'And when I have time \\nto write, I only really like writing poetry. I wonder, Frodo my dear fellow, \\nif you would very much mind tidying things up a bit before you go? Collect \\nall my notes and papers, and my diary too, and take them with you, if you \\nwill. You see, I haven\\'t much time for the selection and the arrangement and \\nall that. Get Sam to help, and when you\\'ve knocked things into shape, come \\nback, and I\\'ll run over it. I won\\'t be too critical.\\' \\n\\n\\'Of course I\\'ll do it!\\' said Frodo. \\'And of course I\\'ll come back soon: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nit won\\'t be dangerous any more. There is a real king now and he will soon \\nput the roads in order.\\' \\n\\n\\'Thank you, my dear fellow!\\' said Bilbo. \\'That really is a very great \\nrelief to my mind.\\' And with that he fell fast asleep again. \\n\\nThe next day Gandalf and the hobbits took leave of Bilbo in his room, \\nfor it was cold out of doors; and then they said farewell to Elrond and all \\nhis household. \\n\\nAs Frodo stood upon the threshold, Elrond wished him a fair journey, \\nand blessed him, and he said: \\n\\n\\'I think, Frodo, that maybe you will not need to come back, unless you \\ncome very soon. For about this time of the year, when the leaves are gold \\nbefore they fall, look for Bilbo in the woods of the Shire. I shall be with \\nhim.\\' \\n\\nThese words no one else heard, and Frodo kept them to himself. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 7 . Homeward Bound \\n\\n\\n\\nAt last the hobbits had their faces turned towards home. They were \\neager now to see the Shire again; but at first they rode only slowly, for \\nFrodo had been ill at ease. When they came to the Ford of Bruinen, he had \\nhalted, and seemed loth to ride into the stream; and they noted that for a \\nwhile his eyes appeared not to see them or things about him. All that day he \\nwas silent. It was the sixth of October. \\n\\n\\'Are you in pain, Frodo?\\' said Gandalf quietly as he rode by Frodo\\'s \\nside. \\n\\n\\'Well, yes I am,\\' said Frodo. \\'It is my shoulder. The wound aches, and \\nthe memory of darkness is heavy on me. It was a year ago today.\\' \\n\\n\\'Alas! there are some wounds that cannot be wholly cured,\\' said \\nGandalf. \\n\\n\\'I fear it may be so with mine,\\' said Frodo. \\'There is no real going \\nback. Though I may come to the Shire, it will not seem the same; for I shall \\nnot be the same. I am wounded with knife, sting, and tooth, and a long \\nburden. Where shall I find rest?\\' \\n\\nGandalf did not answer. \\n\\nBy the end of the next day the pain and unease had passed, and Frodo \\nwas merry again, as merry as if he did not remember the blackness of the day \\nbefore. After that the journey went well, and the days went quickly by; for \\nthey rode at leisure, and often they lingered in the fair woodlands where \\nthe leaves were red and yellow in the autumn sun. At length they came to \\nWeathertop; and it was then drawing towards evening and the shadow of the \\nhill lay dark on the road. Then Frodo begged them to hasten, and he would \\nnot look towards the hill, but rode through its shadow with head bowed and \\ncloak drawn close about him. That night the weather changed, and a wind came \\nfrom the West laden with rain, and it blew loud and chill, and the yellow \\nleaves whirled like birds in the air. When they came to the Chetwood already \\nthe boughs were almost bare, and a great curtain of rain veiled Bree Hill \\nfrom their sight. \\n\\nSo it was that near the end of a wild and wet evening in the last days \\nof October the five travellers rode up the climbing road and came to the \\nSouth-gate of Bree. It was locked fast; and the rain blew in their faces, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand in the darkening sky low clouds went hurrying by, and their hearts sank \\na little, for they had expected more welcome. \\n\\nWhen they had called many times, at last the Gate-keeper came out, and \\nthey saw that he carried a great cudgel. He looked at them with fear and \\nsuspicion; but when he saw that Gandalf was there, and that his companions \\nwere hobbits, in spite of their strange gear, then he brightened and wished \\nthem welcome. \\n\\n\\'Come in!\\' he said, unlocking the gate. \\'We won\\'t stay for news out \\nhere in the cold and the wet, a ruffianly evening. But old Barley will no \\ndoubt give you a welcome at The Pony, and there you\\'ll hear all there is to \\nhear.\\' \\n\\n\\'And there you\\'ll hear later all that we say, and more,\\' laughed \\nGandalf. \\'How is Harry?\\' \\n\\nThe Gate-keeper scowled. \\'Gone,\\' he said. \\'But you\\'d best ask Barliman. \\nGood evening!\\' \\n\\n\\'Good evening to you!\\' they said, and passed through; and then they \\nnoticed that behind the hedge at the road-side a long low hut had been \\nbuilt, and a number of men had come out and were staring at them over the \\nfence. When they came to Bill Ferny\\'s house they saw that the hedge there \\nwas tattered and unkempt, and the windows were all boarded up. \\n\\n\\'Do you think you killed him with that apple, Sam?\\' said Pippin. \\n\\n\\'I\\'m not so hopeful, Mr. Pippin,\\' said Sam. \\'But I\\'d like to know what \\nbecame of that poor pony. He\\'s been on my mind many a time and the wolves \\nhowling and all.\\' \\n\\nAt last they came to The Prancing Pony, and that at least looked \\noutwardly unchanged; and there were lights behind the red curtains in the \\nlower windows. They rang the bell, and Nob came to the door, and opened it a \\ncrack and peeped through; and when he saw them standing under the lamp he \\ngave a cry of surprise. \\n\\n\\'Mr. Butterbur! Master!\\' he shouted. \\'They\\'ve come back!\\' \\n\\n\\'Oh have they? I\\'ll learn them,\\' came Butterbur\\'s voice, and out he \\ncame with a rush, and he had a club in his hand. But when he saw who they \\nwere he stopped short, and the black scowl on his face changed to wonder and \\ndelight. \\n\\n\\'Nob, you woolly -pated ninny!\\' he cried. \\'Can\\'t you give old friends \\ntheir names? You shouldn\\'t go scaring me like that, with times as they are. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, well! And where have you come from? I never expected to see any of \\nyou \\n\\nfolk again, and that\\'s a fact: going off into the Wild with that Strider, \\nand all those Black Men about. But I\\'m right glad to see you, and none more \\nthan Gandalf. Come in! Come in! The same rooms as - before? They\\'re free. \\nIndeed most rooms are empty these days, as I\\'ll not hide from you, for \\nyou\\'ll find it out soon enough. And I\\'ll see what can be done about supper, \\nas soon as may be; but I\\'m short-handed at present. Hey, Nob you slowcoach! \\nTell Bob! Ah, but there I\\'m forgetting, Bob\\'s gone: goes home to his folk at \\nnightfall now. Well, take the guests\\' ponies to the stables, Nob! And you\\'ll \\nbe taking your horse to his stable yourself Gandalf; I don\\'t doubt. A fine \\nbeast, as I said when I first set eyes on him. Well, come in! Make \\nyourselves at home!\\' \\n\\nMr. Butterbur had at any rate not changed his manner of talking, and \\nstill seemed to live in his old breathless bustle. And yet there was hardly \\nanybody about, and all was quiet; from the Common Room there came a \\nlow \\n\\nmurmur of no more than two or three voices. And seen closer in the light of \\ntwo candles that he lit and carried before them the landlord\\'s face looked \\nrather wrinkled and careworn. \\n\\nHe led them down the passage to the parlour that they had used on that \\nstrange night more than a year ago; and they followed him, a little \\ndisquieted, for it seemed plain to them that old Barliman was putting a \\nbrave face on some trouble. Things were not what they had been. But they \\nsaid nothing, and waited. \\n\\nAs they expected Mr. Butterbur came to the parlour after supper to see \\nif all had been to their liking. As indeed it had: no change for the worse \\nhad yet come upon the beer or the victuals at The Pony at any rate. \\'Now I \\nwon\\'t make so bold as to suggest you should come to the Common Room \\ntonight,\\' said Butterbur. \\'You\\'ll be tired; and there isn\\'t many folk there \\nthis evening, anyway. But if you could spare me half an hour before you go \\nto your beds, I would dearly like to have some talk with you, quiet-like by \\nourselves.\\' \\n\\n\\'That is just what we should like, too,\\' said Gandalf. \\'We are not \\ntired. We have been taking things easy. We were wet, cold and hungry, but \\nall that you have cured. Come, sit down! And if you have any pipe-weed, \\nwe\\'ll bless you.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Well, if you\\'d called for anything else, I\\'d have been happier,\\' said \\nButterbur. \\'That\\'s just a thing that we\\'re short of, seeing how we\\'ve only \\ngot what we grow ourselves, and that\\'s not enough. There\\'s none to be had \\nfrom the Shire these days. But I\\'ll do what I can.\\' \\n\\nWhen he came back he brought them enough to last them for a day or two, \\na wad of uncut leaf. \\'Southlinch,\\' he said, \\'and the best we have; but not \\nthe match of Southfarthing, as I\\'ve always said though I\\'m all for Bree in \\nmost matters, begging your pardon.\\' \\n\\nThey put him in a large chair by the wood-fire, and Gandalf sat on the \\nother side of the hearth, and the hobbits in low chairs between them; and \\nthen they talked for many times half an hour, and exchanged all such news as \\nMr. Butterbur wished to hear or give. Most of the things which they had to \\ntell were a mere wonder and bewilderment to their host, and far beyond his \\nvision; and they brought forth few comments other than: \\'You don\\'t say; \\noften repeated in defiance of the evidence of Mr. Butterbur\\'s own ears. \\'You \\ndon\\'t say, Mr. Baggins, or is it Mr. Underhill? I\\'m getting so mixed up. You \\ndon\\'t say, Master Gandalf! Well I never! Who\\'d have thought it in our \\ntimes!\\' \\n\\nBut he did say much on his own account. Things were far from well, he \\nwould say. Business was not even fair, it was downright bad. \\'No one comes \\nnigh Bree now from Outside,\\' he said. \\'And the inside folks, they stay at \\nhome mostly and keep their doors barred. It all comes of those newcomers and \\ngangrels that began coming up the Greenway last year, as you may remember; \\nbut more came later. Some were just poor bodies running away from trouble; \\nbut most were bad men, full o\\' thievery and mischief. And there was trouble \\nright here in Bree, bad trouble. Why, we had a real set-to, and there were \\nsome folk killed, killed dead! If you\\'ll believe me.\\' \\n\\n\\'I will indeed,\\' said Gandalf. \\'How many?\\' \\n\\n\\'Three and two,\\' said Butterbur, referring to the big folk and the \\nlittle. \\'There was poor Mat Heathertoes, and Rowlie Appledore, and little \\nTom Pickthorn from over the Hill; and Willie Banks from up-away, and one of \\nthe Underhills from Staddle: all good fellows, and they\\'re missed. And Harry \\nGoatleaf that used to be on the West-gate, and that Bill Ferny, they came in \\non the strangers\\' side, and they\\'ve gone off with them; and it\\'s my belief \\nthey let them in. On the night of the fight, I mean. And that was after we \\nshowed them the gates and pushed them out: before the year\\'s end, that was; \\nand the fight was early in the New Year, after the heavy snow we had. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'And now they\\'re gone for robbers and live outside, hiding in the woods \\nbeyond Archet, and out in the wilds north-away. It\\'s like a bit of the bad \\nold times tales tell of, I say. It isn\\'t safe on the road and nobody goes \\nfar, and folk lock up early. We have to keep watchers all round the fence \\nand put a lot of men on the gates at nights.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, no one troubled us,\\' said Pippin, \\'and we came along slowly, and \\nkept no watch. We thought we\\'d left all trouble behind us.\\' \\n\\n\\'Ah, that you haven\\'t, Master, more\\'s the pity,\\' said Butterbur. \\'But \\nit\\'s no wonder they left you alone. They wouldn\\'t go for armed folk, with \\nswords and helmets and shields and all. Make them think twice, that would. \\nAnd I must say it put me aback a bit when I saw you.\\' \\n\\nThen the hobbits suddenly realized that people had looked at them with \\namazement not out of surprise at their return so much as in wonder at their \\ngear. They themselves had become so used to warfare and to riding in \\nwell-arrayed companies that they had quite forgotten that the bright mail \\npeeping from under their cloaks, and the helms of Gondor and the Mark, and \\nthe fair devices on their shields, would seem outlandish in their own \\ncountry. And Gandalf, too, was now riding on his tall grey horse, all clad \\nin white with a great mantle of blue and silver over all, and the long sword \\nGlamdring at his side. \\n\\nGandalf laughed. \\'Well, well,\\' he said, \\'if they are afraid of just \\nfive of us, then we have met worse enemies on our travels. But at any rate \\nthey will give you peace at night while we stay.\\' \\n\\n\\'How long will that be?\\' said Butterbur. \\'I\\'ll not deny we should be \\nglad to have you about for a bit. You see, we\\'re not used to such troubles; \\nand the Rangers have all gone away, folk tell me. I don\\'t think we\\'ve \\nrightly understood till now what they did for us. For there\\'s been worse \\nthan robbers about. Wolves were howling round the fences last winter. And \\nthere\\'s dark shapes in the woods, dreadful things that it makes the blood \\nrun cold to think of. It\\'s been very disturbing, if you understand me.\\' \\n\\n\\'I expect it has,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Nearly all lands have been disturbed \\nthese days, very disturbed. But cheer up, Barliman! You have been on the \\nedge of very great troubles, and I am only glad to hear that you have not \\nbeen deeper in. But better times are coming. Maybe, better than any you \\nremember. The Rangers have returned. We came back with them. And there is \\na \\n\\nking again, Barliman. He will soon be turning his mind this way. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Then the Greenway will be opened again, and his messengers will come \\nnorth, and there will be comings and goings, and the evil things will be \\ndriven out of the waste-lands. Indeed the waste in time will be waste no \\nlonger, and there will be people and fields where once there was \\nwilderness.\\' \\n\\nMr. Butterbur shook his head. \\'If there\\'s a few decent respectable folk \\non the roads, that won\\'t do no harm,\\' he said. \\'But we don\\'t want no more \\nrabble and ruffians. And we don\\'t want no outsiders at Bree, nor near Bree \\nat all. We want to be let alone. I don\\'t want a whole crowd o\\' strangers \\ncamping here and settling there and tearing up the wild country.\\' \\n\\n\\'You will be let alone, Barliman,\\' said Gandalf. \\'There is room enough \\nfor realms between Isen and Greyflood, or along the shore lands south of the \\nBrandywine, without any one living within many days\\' ride of Bree. And many \\nfolk used to dwell away north, a hundred miles or more from here, at the far \\nend of the Greenway: on the North Downs or by Lake Evendim.\\' \\n\\n\\'Up away by Deadmen\\'s Dike?\\' said Butterbur, looking even more dubious. \\n\\'That\\'s haunted land, they say. None but a robber would go there.\\' \\n\\n\\'The Rangers go there,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Deadmen\\'s Dike, you say. So it \\nhas been called for long years; but its right name, Barliman, is Fornost \\nErain, Norbury of the Kings. And the King will come there again one day; and \\nthen you\\'ll have some fair folk riding through.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, that sounds more hopeful, I\\'ll allow,\\' said Butterbur. \\'And it \\nwill be good for business, no doubt. So long as he lets Bree alone.\\' \\n\\n\\'He will,\\' said Gandalf. \\'He knows it and loves it.\\' \\n\\n\\'Does he now?\\' said Butterbur looking puzzled. \\'Though I\\'m sure I don\\'t \\nknow why he should, sitting in his big chair up in his great castle, \\nhundreds of miles away. And drinking wine out of a golden cup, I shouldn\\'t \\nwonder. What\\'s The Pony to him, or mugs o\\' beer? Not but what my beer\\'s \\ngood, Gandalf. It\\'s been uncommon good, since you came in the autumn of last \\nyear and put a good word on it. And that\\'s been a comfort in trouble, I will \\nsay.\\' \\n\\n\\'Ah!\\' said Sam. \\'But he says your beer is always good.\\' \\n\\n\\'He says?\\' \\n\\n\\'Of course he does. He\\'s Strider. The chief of the Rangers. Haven\\'t you \\ngot that into your head yet?\\' \\n\\nIt went in at last, and Butterbur\\'s face was a study in wonder. The \\neyes in his broad face grew round, and his mouth opened wide, and he gasped. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Strider!\\' he exclaimed when he got back his breath. \\'Him with a crown and \\nall and a golden cup! Well, what are we coming to?\\' \\n\\n\\'Better times, for Bree at any rate,\\' said Gandalf. \\n\\n\\'I hope so, I\\'m sure,\\' said Butterbur. \\'Well, this has been the nicest \\nchat I\\'ve had in a month of Mondays. And I\\'ll not deny that I\\'ll sleep \\neasier tonight and with a lighter heart. You\\'ve given me a powerful lot to \\nthink over, but I\\'ll put that off until tomorrow. I\\'m for bed, and I\\'ve no \\ndoubt you\\'ll be glad of your beds too. Hey, Nob!\\' he called, going to the \\ndoor. \\'Nob, you slowcoach!\\' \\n\\n\\'Now!\\' he said to himself, slapping his forehead. \\'Now what does that \\nremind me of?\\' \\n\\n\\'Not another letter you\\'ve forgotten. I hope, Mr. Butterbur?\\' said \\nMerry. \\n\\n\\'Now, now, Mr. Brandybuck, don\\'t go reminding me of that! But there, \\nyou\\'ve broken my thought. Now where was I? Nob, stables, ah! that was it. \\nI\\'ve something that belongs to you. If you recollect Bill Ferny and the \\nhorsethieving: his pony as you bought, well, it\\'s here. Come back all of \\nitself, it did. But where it had been to you know better than me. It was as \\nshaggy as an old dog and as lean as a clothes-rail, but it was alive. Nob\\'s \\nlooked after it.\\' \\n\\n\\'What! My Bill?\\' cried Sam. \\'Well, I was born lucky, whatever my gaffer \\nmay say. There\\'s another wish come true! Where is he?\\' Sam would not go to \\nbed until he had visited Bill in his stable. \\n\\nThe travellers stayed in Bree all the next day, and Mr. Butterbur could \\nnot complain of his business next evening at any rate. Curiosity overcame \\nall fears, and his house was crowded. For a while out of politeness the \\nhobbits visited the Common Room in the evening and answered a good \\nmany \\n\\nquestions. Bree memories being retentive, Frodo was asked many times if he \\nhad written his book. \\n\\n\\'Not yet,\\' he answered. \\'I am going home now to put my notes in order.\\' \\n\\nHe promised to deal with the amazing events at Bree, and so give a bit of \\ninterest to a book that appeared likely to treat mostly of the remote and \\nless important affairs \\'away south\\'. \\n\\nThen one of the younger folk called for a song. But at that a hush \\nfell, and he was frowned down, and the call was not repeated. Evidently \\nthere was no wish for any uncanny events in the Common Room again. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo trouble by day, nor any sound by night, disturbed the peace of Bree \\nwhile the travellers remained there; but the next morning they got up early, \\nfor as the weather was still rainy they wished to reach the Shire before \\nnight, and it was a long ride. The Bree folk were all out to see them off, \\nand were in merrier mood than they had been for a year; and those who had \\nnot seen the strangers in all their gear before gaped with wonder at them: \\nat Gandalf with his white beard, and the light that seemed to gleam from \\nhim, as if his blue mantle was only a cloud over sunshine; and at the four \\nhobbits like riders upon errantry out of almost forgotten tales. Even those \\nwho had laughed at all the talk about the King began to think there might be \\nsome truth in it. \\n\\n\\'Well, good luck on your road, and good luck to your home-coming! said \\nMr. Butterbur. \\'I should have warned you before that all\\'s not well in the \\nShire neither, if what we hear is true. Funny goings on, they say. But one \\nthing drives out another, and I was full of my own troubles. But if I may be \\nso bold, you\\'ve come back changed from your travels, and you look now like \\nfolk as can deal with troubles out of hand. I don\\'t doubt you\\'ll soon set \\nall to rights. Good luck to you! And the oftener you come back the better \\nI\\'ll be pleased.\\' \\n\\nThey wished him farewell and rode away, and passed through the \\nWest-gate and on towards the Shire. Bill the pony was with them, and as \\nbefore he had a good deal of baggage, but he trotted along beside Sam and \\nseemed well content. \\n\\n\\'I wonder what old Barliman was hinting at,\\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'I can guess some of it,\\' said Sam gloomily. \\'What I saw in the Mirror: \\ntrees cut down and all, and my old gaffer turned out of the Row. I ought to \\nhave hurried back quicker.\\' \\n\\n\\'And something\\'s wrong with the Southfarthing evidently,\\' said Merry. \\n\\'There\\'s a general shortage of pipe- weed.\\' \\n\\n\\'Whatever it is,\\' said Pippin, \\'Fotho will be at the bottom of it: you \\ncan be sure of that.\\' \\n\\n\\'Deep in, but not at the bottom,\\' said Gandalf. \\'You have forgotten \\nSaruman. He began to take an interest in the Shire before Mordor did.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, we\\'ve got you with us,\\' said Merry, \\'so things will soon be \\ncleared up.\\' \\n\\n\\'I am with you at present,\\' said Gandalf, \\'but soon I shall not be. I \\nam not coming to the Shire. You must settle its affairs yourselves; that is \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhat you have been trained for. Do you not yet understand? My time is over: \\nit is no longer my task to set things to rights, nor to help folk to do so. \\n\\nAnd as for you, my dear friends, you will need no help. You are grown up \\nnow. Grown indeed very high; among the great you are, and I have no longer \\nany fear at all for any of you. \\n\\n\\'But if you would know, I am turning aside soon. I am going to have a \\nlong talk with Bombadil: such a talk as I have not had in all my time. He is \\na moss -gatherer, and I have been a stone doomed to rolling. But my rolling \\ndays are ending, and now we shall have much to say to one another.\\' \\n\\nIn a little while they came to the point on the East Road where they \\nhad taken leave of Bombadil; and they hoped and half expected to see him \\nstanding there to greet them as they went by. But there was no sign of him; \\nand there was a grey mist on the Barrow-downs southwards, and a deep veil \\nover the Old Forest far away. \\n\\nThey halted and Frodo looked south wistfully. \\'I should dearly like to \\nsee the old fellow again,\\' he said. \\'I wonder how he is getting on?\\' \\n\\n\\'As well as ever, you may be sure,\\' said Gandalf. \\'Quite untroubled and \\nI should guess, not much interested in anything that we have done or seen, \\nunless perhaps in our visits to the Ents. There may be a time later for you \\nto go and see him. But if I were you, I should press on now for home, or you \\nwill not come to the Brandywine Bridge before the gates are locked.\\' \\n\\n\\'But there aren\\'t any gates,\\' said Merry, \\'not on the Road; you know \\nthat quite well. There\\'s the Buckland Gate, of course; but they\\'ll let me \\nthrough that at any time.\\' \\n\\n\\'There weren\\'t any gates, you mean,\\' said Gandalf. \\'I think you will \\nfind some now. And you might have more trouble even at the Buckland Gate \\nthan you think. But you\\'ll! manage all right. Good-bye dear friends! Not for \\nthe last time, not yet. Good-bye!\\' \\n\\nHe turned Shadowfax off the Road, and the great horse leaped the green \\ndike that here ran beside it; and then at a cry from Gandalf he was gone, \\nracing towards the Barrow-downs like a wind from the North. \\n\\n\\'Well here we are, just the four of us that started out together,\\' said \\nMerry. \\'We have left all the rest behind, one after another. It seems almost \\nlike a dream that has slowly faded.\\' \\n\\n\\'Not to me,\\' said Frodo. \\'To me it feels more like falling asleep \\nagain.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 8 . The Scouring of the Shire \\n\\n\\n\\nIt was after nightfall when, wet and tired, the travellers came at last \\nto the Brandywine, and they found the way barred. At either end of the \\nBridge there was a great spiked gate; and on the further side of the river \\nthey could see that some new houses had been built: two-storeyed with narrow \\nstraight- sided windows, bare and dimly lit, all very gloomy and \\nun-Shirelike. \\n\\nThey hammered on the outer gate and called, but there was at first no \\nanswer; and then to their surprise someone blew a horn, and the lights in \\nthe windows went out. A voice shouted in the dark: \\n\\n\\'Who\\'s that? Be off! You can\\'t come in: Can\\'t you read the notice: No \\nadmittance between sundown and sunrise ?\\' \\n\\n\\'Of course we can\\'t read the notice in the dark.\\' Sam shouted back. \\n\\n\\'And if hobbits of the Shire are to be kept out in the wet on a night like \\nthis, I\\'ll tear down your notice when I find it.\\' \\n\\nAt that a window slammed, and a crowd of hobbits with lanterns poured \\nout of the house on the left. They opened the further gate, and some came \\nover the bridge. When they saw the travellers they seemed frightened. \\n\\n\\'Come along!\\' said Merry, recognizing one of the hobbits. \\'If you don\\'t \\nknow me, Hob Hayward, you ought to. I am Merry Brandybuck, and I should \\nlike \\n\\nto know what all this is about, and what a Bucklander like you is doing \\nhere. You used to be on the Hay Gate.\\' \\n\\n\\'Bless me! If s Master Merry, to be sure, and all dressed up for \\nfighting!\\' said old Hob. \\'Why, they said you was dead! Lost in the Old \\nForest by all accounts. I\\'m pleased to see you alive after all!\\' \\n\\n\\'Then stop gaping at me through the bars, and open the gate!\\' said \\nMerry. \\n\\n\\'I\\'m sorry, Master Merry, but we have orders.\\' \\n\\n\\'Whose orders?\\' \\n\\n\\'The Chiefs up at Bag End.\\' \\n\\n\\'Chief? Chief? Do you mean Mr. Lotho?\\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'I suppose so, Mr. Baggins; but we have to say just \"the Chief\" \\nnowadays.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Do you indeed!\\' said Frodo. \\'Well, lam glad he has dropped the \\nBaggins at any rate. But it is evidently high time that the family dealt \\nwith him and put him in his place.\\' \\n\\nA hush fell on the hobbits beyond the gate. \\'It won\\'t do no good \\ntalking that way,\\' said one. \\'He\\'ll get to hear of it. And if you make so \\nmuch noise, you\\'ll wake the Chiefs Big Man.\\' \\n\\n\\'We shall wake him up in a way that will surprise him,\\' said Merry. \\'If \\nyou mean that your precious Chief has been hiring ruffians out of the wild, \\nthen we\\'ve not come back too soon.\\' He sprang from his pony, and seeing the \\nnotice in the light of the lanterns, he tore it down and threw it over the \\ngate. The hobbits backed away and made no move to open it. \\'Come on, \\nPippin!\\' said Merry. \\'Two is enough.\\' \\n\\nMerry and Pippin climbed the gate, and the hobbits fled. Another horn \\nsounded. Out of the bigger house on the right a large heavy figure appeared \\nagainst a light in the doorway. \\n\\n\\'What\\'s all this,\\' he snarled as he came forward. \\'Gate-breaking? You \\nclear out, or I\\'ll break your filthy little necks!\\' Then he stopped, for he \\nhad caught the gleam of swords. \\n\\n\\'Bill Ferny,\\' said Merry, \\'if you don\\'t open that gate in ten seconds, \\nyou\\'ll regret it. I shall set steel to you, if you don\\'t obey. And when you \\nhave opened the gates you will go through them and never return. You are a \\nruffian and a highway -robber.\\' \\n\\nBill Ferny flinched and shuffled to the gate and unlocked it. \\'Give me \\nthe key!\\' said Merry. But the ruffian flung it at his head and then darted \\nout into the darkness. As he passed the ponies one of them let fly with his \\nheels and just caught him as he ran. He went off with a yelp into the night \\nand was never heard of again. \\n\\n\\'Neat work, Bill,\\' said Sam, meaning the pony. \\n\\n\\'So much for your Big Man,\\' said Merry. \\'We\\'ll see the Chief later. In \\nthe meantime we want a lodging for the night, and as you seem to have pulled \\ndown the Bridge Inn and built this dismal place instead, you\\'ll have to put \\nus up.\\' \\n\\n\\'I am sorry, Mr. Merry,\\' said Hob, \\'but it isn\\'t allowed.\\' \\n\\n\\'What isn\\'t allowed?\\' \\n\\nTaking in folk off-hand like and eating extra food, and all that, said \\nHob. \\n\\n\\'What\\'s the matter with the place?\\' said Merry. \\'Has it been a bad \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyear, or what? I thought it had been a fine summer and harvest.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well no, the year\\'s been good enough,\\' said Hob. \\'We grows a lot of \\nfood, but we don\\'t rightly know what becomes of it. It\\'s all these \\n\"gatherers\" and \"sharers\", I reckon, going round counting and measuring and \\ntaking off to storage. They do more gathering than sharing, and we never see \\nmost of the stuff again.\\' \\n\\n\\'Oh come!\\' said Pippin yawning. \\'This is all too tiresome for me \\ntonight. We\\'ve got food in our bags. Just give us a room to lie down in. \\n\\nIt\\'ll be better than many places I have seen.\\' \\n\\nThe hobbits at the gate still seemed ill at ease, evidently some rule \\nor other was being broken; but there was no gainsaying four such masterful \\ntravellers, all armed, and two of them uncommonly large and strong -looking. \\nFrodo ordered the gates to be locked again. There was some sense at any rate \\nin keeping a guard, while ruffians were still about. Then the four \\ncompanions went into the hobbit guard-house and made themselves as \\ncomfortable as they could. It was a bare and ugly place, with a mean little \\ngrate that would not allow a good fire. In the upper rooms were little rows \\nof hard beds, and on every wall there was a notice and a list of Rules. \\nPippin tore them down. There was no beer and very little food, but with what \\nthe travellers brought and shared out they all made a fair meal; and Pippin \\nbroke Rule 4 by putting most of next day\\'s allowance of wood on the fire. \\n\\n\\'Well now, what about a smoke, while you tell us what has been \\nhappening in the Shire?\\' he said. \\n\\n\\'There isn\\'t no pipe-weed now,\\' said Hob; \\'at least only for the \\nChiefs men. All the stocks seem to have gone. We do hear that waggon-loads \\nof it went away down the old road out of the Southfarthing, over Sarn Ford \\nway. That would be the end o\\' last year, after you left. But it had been \\ngoing away quietly before that, in a small way. That Lotho-- \\' \\n\\n\\'Now you shut up, Hob Hayward!\\' cried several of the others. \\'You know \\ntalk o\\' that sort isn\\'t allowed. The Chief will hear of it, and we\\'ll all be \\nin trouble.\\' \\n\\n\\'He wouldn\\'t hear naught, if some of you here weren\\'t sneaks,\\' rejoined \\nHob hotly. \\n\\n\\'All right, all right!\\' said Sam. \"That\\'s quite enough. I don\\'t want to \\nhear no more. No welcome, no beer, no smoke, and a lot of rules and ore-talk \\ninstead. I hoped to have a rest, but I can see there\\'s work and trouble \\nahead. Let\\'s sleep and forget it till morning!\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe new \\'Chief evidently had means of getting news. It was a good \\nforty miles from the Bridge to Bag End, but someone made the journey in a \\nhurry. So Frodo and his friends soon discovered. \\n\\nThey had not made any definite plans, but had vaguely thought of going \\ndown to Crickhollow together first, and resting there a bit. But now, seeing \\nwhat things were like, they decided to go straight to Hobbiton. So the next \\nday they set out along the Road and jogged along steadily. The wind had \\ndropped but the sky was grey. The land looked rather sad and forlorn; but it \\nwas after all the first of November and the fag-end of Autumn. Still there \\nseemed an unusual amount of burning going on, and smoke rose from many \\npoints round about. A great cloud of it was going up far away in the \\ndirection of the Woody End. \\n\\nAs evening fell they were drawing near to Frogmorton, a village right \\non the Road, about twenty -two miles from the Bridge. There they meant to \\nstay the night; The Floating Log at Frogmorton was a good inn. But as they \\ncame to the east end of the village they met a barrier with a large board \\nsaying NO ROAD; and behind it stood a large band of Shirriffs with staves in \\ntheir hands and feathers in their caps, looking both important and rather \\nscared. \\n\\n\\'What\\'s all this?\\' said Frodo, feeling inclined to laugh. \\n\\nThis is what it is, Mr. Baggins, said the leader of the Shirriffs, a \\ntwo-feather hobbit: \\'You\\'re arrested for Gate-breaking, and Tearing up of \\nRules, and Assaulting Gate-keepers, and Trespassing, and Sleeping in \\nShire-buildings without Feave, and Bribing Guards with Food.\\' \\n\\n\\'And what else?\\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'That\\'ll do to go on with,\\' said the Shirriff-leader. \\n\\n\\'I can add some more, if you like it,\\' said Sam. \\'Calling your Chief \\nNames, Wishing to punch his Pimply Face, and Thinking you Shirriffs look a \\nlot of Tom-fools.\\' \\n\\n\\'There now, Mister, that\\'ll do. It\\'s the Chiefs orders that you\\'re to \\ncome along quiet. We\\'re going to take you to Bywater and hand you over to \\nthe Chiefs Men; and when he deals with your case you can have your say. But \\nif you don\\'t want to stay in the Fockholes any longer than you need, I \\nshould cut the say short, if I was you.\\' \\n\\nTo the discomfiture of the Shirriffs Frodo and his companions all \\nroared with laughter. \\'Don\\'t be absurd!\\' said Frodo. \\'I am going where I \\nplease, and in my own time. I happen to be going to Bag End on business, but \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nif you insist on going too, well that is your affair.\\' \\n\\n\\'Very well, Mr. Baggins,\\' said the leader, pushing the barrier aside. \\n\\n\\'But don\\'t forget I\\'ve arrested you.\\' \\n\\n\\'I won\\'t,\\' said Frodo. \\'Never. But I may forgive you. Now I am not \\ngoing any further today, so if you\\'ll kindly escort me to The Floating Log , \\n\\nI\\'ll be obliged.\\' \\n\\n\\'I can\\'t do that, Mr. Baggins. The inn\\'s closed. There\\'s a \\nShirriff-house at the far end of the village. I\\'ll take you there. \\' \\n\\n\\'All right,\\' said Frodo. \\'Go on and we\\'ll follow.\\' \\n\\nSam had been looking the Shirriffs up and down and had spotted one that \\nhe knew. \\'Hey, come here Robin Smallburrow!\\' he called. \\'I want a word with \\nyou.\\' \\n\\nWith a sheepish glance at his leader, who looked wrathful but did not \\ndare to interfere, Shirriff Smallburrow fell back and walked beside Sam, who \\ngot down off his pony. \\n\\n\\'Look here, Cock-robin!\\' said Sam. \\'You\\'re Hobbiton-bred and ought to \\nhave more sense, coming a-waylaying Mr. Frodo and all. And what\\'s all this \\nabout the inn being closed?\\' \\n\\n\\'They\\'re all closed,\\' said Robin. \\'The Chief doesn\\'t hold with beer. \\nLeastways that is how it started. But now I reckon it\\'s his Men that has it \\nall. And he doesn\\'t hold with folk moving about; so if they will or they \\nmust, then they has to go to the Shirriff-house and explain their business.\\' \\n\\n\\'You ought to be ashamed of yourself having anything to do with such \\nnonsense,\\' said Sam. \\'You used to like the inside of an inn better than the \\noutside yourself. You were always popping in, on duty or off.\\' \\n\\n\\'And so I would be still, Sam, if I could. But don\\'t be hard on me. \\n\\nWhat can I do? You know how I went for a Shirriff seven years ago, before \\nany of this began. Gave me a chance of walking round the country and seeing \\nfolk, and hearing the news, and knowing where the good beer was. But now \\nit\\'s different.\\' \\n\\n\\'But you can give it up, stop Shirriffing, if it has stopped being a \\nrespectable job,\\' said Sam. \\n\\n\\'We\\'re not allowed to,\\' said Robin. \\n\\n\\'If I hear not allowed much oftener,\\' said Sam, \\'I\\'m going to get \\nangry.\\' \\n\\n\\'Can\\'t say as I\\'d be sorry to see it,\\' said Robin lowering his voice. \\n\\n\\'If we all got angry together something might be done. But it\\'s these Men, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSam, the Chiefs Men. He sends them round everywhere, and if any of us small \\nfolk stand up for our rights, they drag him off to the Lockholes. They took \\nold Flourdumpling, old Will Whitfoot the Mayor, first, and they\\'ve taken a \\nlot more. Lately it\\'s been getting worse. Often they beat \\'em now.\\' \\n\\n\\'Then why do you do their work far them?\\' said Sam angrily. \\'Who sent \\nyou to Frogmorton?\\' \\n\\n\\'No one did. We stay here in the big Shirriff-house. We\\'re the First \\nEastfarthing Troop now. There\\'s hundreds of Shirriffs all told and they want \\nmore, with all these new rules. Most of them are in it against their will, \\nbut not all. Even in the Shire there are some as like minding other folk\\'s \\nbusiness and talking big. And there\\'s worse than that: there\\'s a few as do \\nspy-work for the Chief and his Men.\\' \\n\\n\\'Ah! So that\\'s how you had news of us, is it?\\' \\n\\n\\'That\\'s right. We aren\\'t allowed to send by it now, but they use the \\nold Quick Post service, and keep special runners at different points. One \\ncame in from Whitfurrows last night with a \"secret message\", and another \\ntook it on from here. And a message came back this afternoon saying you was \\nto be arrested and taken to By water, not direct to the Lockholes. The Chief \\nwants to see you at once, evidently.\\' \\n\\n\\'He won\\'t be so eager when Mr. Frodo has finished with him,\\' said Sam. \\n\\nThe Shirriff-house at Frogmorton was as bad as the Bridge-house. It had \\nonly one storey, but it had the same narrow windows, and it was built of \\nugly pale bricks, badly laid. Inside it was damp and cheerless, and supper \\nwas served on a long bare table that had not been scrubbed for weeks. The \\nfood deserved no better setting. The travellers were glad to leave the \\nplace. It was about eighteen miles to Bywater, and they set off at ten \\no\\'clock in the morning. They would have started earlier, only the delay so \\nplainly annoyed the Shirriff-leader. The west wind had shifted northward and \\nit was turning colder, but the rain was gone. \\n\\nIt was rather a comic cavalcade that left the village, though the few \\nfolk that came out to stare at the \\'get-up\\' of the travellers did not seem \\nquite sure whether laughing was allowed. A dozen Shirriffs had been told off \\nas escort to the \\'prisoners\\'; but Merry made them march in front, while \\nFrodo and his friends rode behind. Merry, Pippin, and Sam sat at their ease \\nlaughing and talking and singing, while the Shirriffs stumped along trying \\nto look stern and important. Frodo, however, was silent and looked rather \\nsad and thoughtful. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe last person they passed was a sturdy old gaffer clipping a hedge. \\n\\'Hullo, hullo!\\' he jeered. \\'Now who\\'s arrested who?\\' \\n\\nTwo of the Shirriffs immediately left the party and went towards him. \\n\\'Leader!\\' said Merry. \\'Order your fellows back to their places at once, if \\nyou don\\'t want me to deal with them!\\' \\n\\nThe two hobbits at a sharp word from the leader came back sulkily. \\'Now \\nget on!\\' said Merry, and after that the travellers saw to it that their \\nponies\\' pace was quick enough to push the Shirriffs along as fast as they \\ncould go. The sun came out, and in spite of the chilly wind they were soon \\npuffing and sweating. \\n\\nAt the Three-Farthing Stone they gave it up. They had done nearly \\nfourteen miles with only one rest at noon. It was now three o\\'clock. They \\nwere hungry and very footsore and they could not stand the pace. \\n\\n\\'Well, come along in your own time!\\' said Merry. \\'We are going on.\\' \\n\\n\\'Good-bye, Cock-robin!\\' said Sam. \\'I\\'ll wait for you outside The Green \\nDragon , if you haven\\'t forgotten where that is. Don\\'t dawdle on the way!\\' \\n\\n\\'You\\'re breaking arrest, that\\'s what you\\'re doing,\\' said the leader \\nruefully, \\'and I can\\'t be answerable.\\' \\n\\n\\'We shall break a good many things yet, and not ask you to answer \\' \\nsaid Pippin. \\'Good luck to you!\\' \\n\\nThe travellers trotted on, and as the sun began to sink towards the \\nWhite Downs far away on the western horizon they came to Bywater by its \\nwide \\n\\npool; and there they had their first really painful shock. This was Frodo \\nand Sam\\'s own country, and they found out now that they cared about it more \\nthan any other place in the world. Many of the houses that they had known \\nwere missing. Some seemed to have been burned down. The pleasant row of \\nold \\n\\nhobbit-holes in the bank on the north side of the Pool were deserted, and \\ntheir little gardens that used to run down bright to the water\\'s edge were \\nrank with weeds. Worse, there was a whole line of the ugly new houses all \\nalong Pool Side, where the Hobbiton Road ran close to the bank. An avenue of \\ntrees had stood there. They were all gone. And looking with dismay up the \\nroad towards Bag End they saw a tallchimneyofbrickinthedistance.lt \\nwas pouring out black smoke into the evening air. \\n\\nSam was beside himself. \\'I\\'m going right on, Mr. Frodo!\\' he cried. \\'I\\'m \\ngoing to see what\\'s up. I want to find my gaffer.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'We ought to find out first what we\\'re in for, Sam,\\' said Merry. \\'I \\nguess that the \"Chief\" will have a gang of ruffians handy. We had better \\nfind someone who will tell us how things are round here.\\' \\n\\nBut in the village of By water all the houses and holes were shut, and \\nno one greeted them. They wondered at this, but they soon discovered the \\nreason of it. When they reached The Green Dragon, the last house on the \\nHobbiton side, now lifeless and with broken windows, they were disturbed to \\nsee half a dozen large ill-favoured Men lounging against the inn-wall; they \\nwere squint-eyed and sallow-faced. \\n\\n\\'Like that friend of Bill Ferny\\'s at Bree,\\' said Sam. \\n\\n\\'Like many that I saw at Isengard,\\' muttered Merry. \\n\\nThe ruffians had clubs in their hands and horns by their belts, but \\nthey had no other weapons, as far as could be seen. As the travellers rode \\nup they left the wall and walked into the road, blocking the way. \\n\\n\\'Where d\\'you think you\\'re going?\\' said one, the largest and most \\nevil-looking of the crew. \\'There\\'s no road for you any further. And where \\nare those precious Shirriffs?\\' \\n\\n\\'Coming along nicely,\\' said Merry. \\'A little footsore, perhaps. We \\npromised to wait for them here.\\' \\n\\n\\'Garn, what did I say?\\' said the ruffian to his mates. \\'I told Sharkey \\nit was no good trusting those little fools. Some of our chaps ought to have \\nbeen sent.\\' \\n\\n\\'And what difference would that have made, pray?\\' said Merry. \\'We are \\nnot used to footpads in this country, but we know how to deal with them.\\' \\n\\n\\'Footpads, eh?\\' said the man: \\'So that\\'s your tone, is it? Change it, \\nor we\\'ll change it for you. You little folk are getting too uppish. Don\\'t \\nyou trust too much in the Boss\\'s kind heart. Sharkey\\'s come now and he\\'ll do \\nwhat Sharkey says.\\' \\n\\n\\'And what may that be?\\' said Frodo quietly. \\n\\n\\'This country wants waking up and setting to rights,\\' said the ruffian, \\n\\n\\'and Sharkey\\'s going to do it; and make it hard, if you drive him to it. You \\nneed a bigger Boss. And you\\'ll get one before the year is out, if there\\'s \\nany more trouble. Then you\\'ll learn a thing or two, you little rat-folk.\\' \\n\\n\\'Indeed. I am glad to hear of your plans,\\' said Frodo. \\'I am on my way \\nto call on Mr. Lotho, and he may be interested to hear of them too.\\' \\n\\nThe ruffian laughed. \\'Lotho! He knows all right. Don\\'t you worry. He\\'ll \\ndo what Sharkey says. Because if a Boss gives trouble, we can change him. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSee? And if little folks try to push in where they\\'re not wanted, we can put \\nthem out of mischief. See?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, I see,\\' said Frodo. \\'For one thing, I see that you\\'re behind the \\ntimes and the news here. Much has happened since you left the South. Your \\nday is over, and all other ruffians\\'. The Dark Tower has fallen, and there \\nis a King in Gondor. And Isengard has been destroyed, and your precious \\nmaster is a beggar in the wilderness. I passed him on the road. The King\\'s \\nmessengers will ride up the Greenway now not bullies from Isengard.\\' \\n\\nThe man stared at him and smiled. \\'A beggar in the wilderness!\\' he \\nmocked. \\'Oh, is he indeed? Swagger it, swagger it, my little cock-a-whoop. \\nBut that won\\'t stop us living in this fat little country where you have \\nlazed long enough. And\\' - he snapped his fingers in Frodo\\'s face - \\'King\\'s \\nmessengers! That for them! When I see one, I\\'ll take notice, perhaps.\\' \\n\\nThis was too much for Pippin. His thoughts went back to the Field of \\nCormallen, and here was a squint-eyed rascal calling the Ring-bearer \\'little \\ncock-a-whoop\\'. He cast back his cloak, flashed out his sword, and the silver \\nand sable of Gondor gleamed on him as he rode forward. \\n\\n\\'I am a messenger of the King,\\' he said. \\'You are speaking to the \\nKing\\'s friend, and one of the most renowned in all the lands of the West. \\nYou are a ruffian and a fool. Down on your knees in the road and ask pardon, \\nor I will set this troll\\'s bane in you!\\' \\n\\nThe sword glinted in the westering sun. Merry and Sam drew their swords \\nalso and rode up to support Pippin; but Frodo did not move. The ruffians \\ngave back. Scaring Breeland peasants, and bullying bewildered hobbits, had \\nbeen their work. Fearless hobbits with bright swords and grim faces were a \\ngreat surprise. And there was a note in the voices of these newcomers that \\nthey had not heard before. It chilled them with fear. \\n\\n\\'Go!\\' said Merry. \\'If you trouble this village again, you will regret \\nit.\\' The three hobbits came on, and then the ruffians turned and fled \\nrunning away up the Hobbiton Road; but they blew their horns as they ran. \\n\\n\\'Well, we\\'ve come back none too soon,\\' said Merry. \\n\\n\\'Not a day too soon. Perhaps too late, at any rate to save Lotho,\\' said \\nFrodo. \\'Miserable fool, but I am sorry for him.\\' \\n\\n\\'Save Lotho? Whatever do you mean?\\' said Pippin. \\'Destroy him I should \\nsay.\\' \\n\\n\\'I don\\'t think you quite understand things, Pippin,\\' said Frodo. \\'Lotho \\nnever meant things to come to this pass. He has been a wicked fool, but he\\'s \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncaught now. The ruffians are on top, gathering, robbing and bullying, and \\nrunning or ruining things as they like, in his name. And not in his name \\neven for much longer. He\\'s a prisoner in Bag End now, I expect, and very \\nfrightened. We ought to try and rescue him.\\' \\n\\n\\'Weill am staggered!\\' said Pippin. \\'Of all the ends to our journey \\nthat is the very last I should have thought of: to have to fight half-ores \\nand ruffians in the Shire itself - to rescue Lotho Pimple!\\' \\n\\n\\'Fight?\\' said Frodo. \\'Well, I suppose it may come to that. But \\nremember: there is to be no slaying of hobbits, not even if they have gone \\nover to the other side. Really gone over, I mean; not just obeying ruffians\\' \\norders because they are frightened. No hobbit has ever killed another on \\npurpose in the Shire, and it is not to begin now. And nobody is to be killed \\nat all, if it can be helped. Keep your tempers and hold your hands to the \\nlast possible moment!\\' \\n\\n\\'But if there are many of these ruffians,\\' said Merry, \\'it will \\ncertainly mean fighting. You won\\'t rescue Fotho, or the Shire, just by being \\nshocked and sad, my dear Frodo.\\' \\n\\n\\'No,\\' said Pippin. \\'It won\\'t be so easy scaring them a second time. \\n\\nThey were taken by surprise. You heard that horn-blowing? Evidently there \\nare other ruffians near at hand. They\\'ll be much bolder when there\\'s more of \\nthem together. We ought to think of taking cover somewhere for the night. \\nAfter all we\\'re only four, even if we are armed.\\' \\n\\n\\'I\\'ve an idea,\\' said Sam. \\'Fet\\'s go to old Tom Cotton\\'s down South \\nFane! He always was a stout fellow. And he has a lot of lads that were all \\nfriends of mine.\\' \\n\\n\\'No!\\' said Merry. \\'It\\'s no good \"getting under cover\". That is just \\nwhat people have been doing, and just what these ruffians like. They will \\nsimply come down on us in force, corner us, and then drive us out, or burn \\nus in. No, we have got to do something at once.\\' \\n\\n\\'Do what?\\' said Pippin. \\n\\n\\'Raise the Shire!\\' said Merry. \\'Now! Wake all our people! They hate all \\nthis, you can see: all of them except perhaps one or two rascals, and a few \\nfools that want to be important, but don\\'t at all understand what is really \\ngoing on. But Shire-folk have been so comfortable so long they don\\'t know \\nwhat to do. They just want a match, though, and they\\'ll go up in fire. The \\nChiefs Men must know that. They\\'ll try to stamp on us and put us out quick. \\nWe\\'ve only got a very short time. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Sam, you can make a dash for Cotton\\'s farm, if you like. He\\'s the \\nchief person round here, and the sturdiest. Come on! I am going to blow the \\nhorn of Rohan, and give them all some music they have never heard before.\\' \\n\\nThey rode back to the middle of the village. There Sam turned aside and \\ngalloped off down the lane that led south to Cotton\\'s. He had not gone far \\nwhen he heard a sudden clear horn-call go up ringing into the sky. Far over \\nhill and field it echoed; and so compelling was that call that Sam himself \\nalmost turned and dashed back. His pony reared and neighed. \\n\\n\\'On, lad! On!\\' he cried. \\'We\\'ll be going back soon.\\' \\n\\nThen he heard Merry change the note, and up went the Horn-cry of \\nBuckland, shaking the air. \\n\\nAwake! Awake! Fear, Fire, Foes! Awake! \\n\\nFire, Foes! Awake! \\n\\nBehind him Sam heard a hubbub of voices and a great din and slamming of \\ndoors. In front of him lights sprang out in the gloaming; dogs barked; feet \\ncame running. Before he got to the lane\\'s end there was Farmer Cotton with \\nthree of his lads, Young Tom, Jolly, and Nick, hurrying towards him. They \\nhad axes in their hands, and barred the way. \\n\\n\\'Nay! It\\'s not one of them ruffians,\\' Sam heard the farmer say. \\'It\\'s a \\nhobbit by the size of it, but all dressed up queer. Hey!\\' he cried. \\'Who are \\nyou, and what\\'s all this to-do?\\' \\n\\n\\'It\\'s Sam, Sam Gamgee. I\\'ve come back.\\' \\n\\nFarmer Cotton came up close and stared at him in the twilight. \\'Well!\\' \\nhe exclaimed. \\'The voice is right, and your face is no worse than it was, \\n\\nSam. But I should a\\' passed you in the street in that gear. You\\'ve been in \\nforeign parts, seemingly. We feared you were dead.\\' \\n\\n\\'That I ain\\'t!\\' said Sam. \\'Nor Mr. Frodo. He\\'s here and his friends. \\n\\nAnd that\\'s the to-do. They\\'re raising the Shire. We\\'re going to clear out \\nthese ruffians, and their Chief too. We\\'re starting now.\\' \\n\\n\\'Good, good!\\' cried Farmer Cotton. \\'So it\\'s begun at last! I\\'ve been \\nitching for trouble all this year, but folks wouldn\\'t help. And I\\'ve had the \\nwife and Rosie to think of. These ruffians don\\'t stick at nothing. But come \\non now, lads! By water is up! We must be in it!\\' \\n\\n\\'What about Mrs. Cotton and Rosie?\\' said Sam. \\'It isn\\'t safe yet for \\nthem to be left all alone.\\' \\n\\n\\'My Nibs is with them. But you can go and help him, if you have a \\nmind,\\' said Farmer Cotton with a grin. Then he and his sons ran off towards \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe village. \\n\\nSam hurried to the house. By the large round door at the top of the \\nsteps from the wide yard stood Mrs. Cotton and Rosie, and Nibs in front of \\nthem grasping a hay-fork. \\n\\n\\'It\\'s me!\\' shouted Sam as he trotted up. \\'Sam Gamgee! So don\\'t try \\nprodding me, Nibs. Anyway, I\\'ve a mail-shirt on me.\\' \\n\\nHe jumped down from his pony and went up the steps. They stared at him \\nin silence. \\'Good evening, Mrs. Cotton!\\' he said. \\'Hullo Rosie!\\' \\n\\n\\'Hullo, Sam!\\' said Rosie. \\'Where\\'ve you been I They said you were dead; \\nbut I\\'ve been expecting you since the Spring. You haven\\'t hurried have you?\\' \\n\\n\\'Perhaps not,\\' said Sam abashed. \\'But I\\'m hurrying now. We\\'re setting \\nabout the ruffians, and I\\'ve got to get back to Mr. Frodo. But I thought I\\'d \\nhave a look and see how Mrs. Cotton was keeping, and you, Rosie.\\' \\n\\n\\'We\\'re keeping nicely, thank you,\\' said Mrs. Cotton. \\'Or should be, if \\nit weren\\'t for these thieving ruffians.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, be off with you!\\' said Rosie. \\'If you\\'ve been looking after Mr. \\n\\nFrodo all this while, what d\\'you want to leave him for, as soon as things \\nlook dangerous?\\' \\n\\nThis was too much for Sam. It needed a week\\'s answer, or none. He \\nturned away and mounted his pony. But as he started off, Rosie ran down the \\nsteps. \\n\\n\\'I think you look fine, Sam,\\' she said. \\'Go on now! But take care of \\nyourself, and come straight back as soon as you have settled the ruffians!\\' \\n\\nWhen Sam got back he found the whole village roused. Already, apart \\nfrom many younger lads, more than a hundred sturdy hobbits were assembled \\nwith axes, and heavy hammers, and long knives, and stout staves: and a few \\nhad hunting-bows. More were still coming in from outlying farms. \\n\\nSome of the village-folk had lit a large fire, just to enliven things, \\nand also because it was one of the things forbidden by the Chief. It burned \\nbright as night came on. Others at Merry\\'s orders were setting up barriers \\nacross the road at each end of the village. When the Shirriffs came up to \\nthe lower one they were dumbfounded; but as soon as they saw how things \\nwere, most of them took off their feathers and joined in the revolt. The \\nothers slunk away. \\n\\nSam found Frodo and his friends by the fire talking to old Tom Cotton, \\nwhile an admiring crowd of Bywater folk stood round and stared. \\n\\n\\'Well, what\\'s the next move?\\' said Farmer Cotton. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'I can\\'t say,\\' said Frodo, \\'until I know more. How many of these \\nruffians are there?\\' \\n\\n\\'That\\'s hard to tell,\\' said Cotton. \\'They moves about and comes and \\ngoes. There\\'s sometimes fifty of them in their sheds up Hobbiton way; but \\nthey go out from there roving round, thieving or \"gathering\" as they call \\nit. Still there\\'s seldom less than a score round the Boss, as they names \\nhim. He\\'s at Bag End, or was; but he don\\'t go outside the rounds now. No one \\ns seen him at all, in fact, for a week or two; but the Men don\\'t let no one \\ngo near.\\' \\n\\n\\'Hobbiton\\'s not their only place, is it?\\' said Pippin. \\n\\n\\'No, more\\'s the pity,\\' said Cotton. \\'There\\'s a good few down south in \\nLongbottom and by Sarn Ford, I hear; and some more lurking in the Woody \\nEnd; \\n\\nand they\\'ve sheds at Waymeet. And then there\\'s the Lockholes, as they call \\n\\'em: the old storage -tunnels at Michel Delving that they\\'ve made into \\nprisons for those as stand up to them. Still I reckon there\\'s not above \\nthree hundred of them in the Shire all told, and maybe less. We can master \\nthem, if we stick together.\\' \\n\\n\\'Have they got any weapons?\\' asked Merry. \\n\\n\\'Whips, knives, and clubs, enough for their dirty work: that\\'s all \\nthey\\'ve showed so far,\\' said Cotton. \\'But I dare say they\\'ve got other gear, \\nif it comes to fighting. Some have bows, anyway. They\\'ve shot one or two of \\nour folk.\\' \\n\\n\\'There you are, Frodo!\\' said Merry. \\'I knew we should have to fight. \\n\\nWell, they started the killing.\\' \\n\\n\\'Not exactly,\\' said Cotton. \\'Leastways not the shooting. Tooks started \\nthat. You see our dad Mr. Peregrin, he\\'s never had no truck with this Lotho, \\nnot from the beginning: said that if anyone was going to play the chief at \\nthis time of day, it would be the right Thain of the Shire and no upstart. \\n\\nAnd when Lotho sent his Men they got no change out of him. Tooks are lucky, \\nthey\\'ve got those deep holes in the Green Hills, the Great Smials and all, \\nand the ruffians can\\'t come at \\'em; and they won\\'t let the ruffians come on \\ntheir land. If they do, Tooks hunt \\'em. Tooks shot three for prowling and \\nrobbing. After that the ruffians turned nastier. And they keep a pretty \\nclose watch on Tookland. No one gets in nor out of it now.\\' \\n\\n\\'Good for the Tooks!\\' cried Pippin. \\'But someone is going to get in \\nagain, now. I am off to the Smials. Anyone coming with me to Tuckborough?\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPippin rode off with half a dozen lads on ponies. \\'See you soon!\\' he \\ncried. \\'It\\'s only fourteen miles or so over the fields. I\\'ll bring you back \\nan army of Tooks in the morning.\\' Merry blew a horn-call after them as they \\nrode off into the gathering night. The people cheered. \\n\\n\\'All the same,\\' said Frodo to all those who stood near, \\'I wish for no \\nkilling; not even of the ruffians, unless it must be done, to prevent them \\nfrom hurting hobbits.\\' \\n\\n\\'All right!\\' said Merry. \\'But we shall be having a visit from the \\nHobbiton gang any time now, I think. They won\\'t come just to talk things \\nover. We\\'ll try to deal with them neatly, but we must be prepared for the \\nworst. Now I\\'ve got a plan.\\' \\n\\n\\'Very good,\\' said Frodo. \\'You make the arrangements.\\' \\n\\nJust then some hobbits, who had been sent out towards Hobbiton, came \\nrunning in. \\'They\\'re coming!\\' they said. \\'A score or more. But two have gone \\noff west across country.\\' \\n\\n\\'To Waymeet, that\\'ll be,\\' said Cotton, \\'to fetch more of the gang. \\n\\nWell, it\\'s fifteen mile each way. We needn\\'t trouble about them just yet.\\' \\n\\nMerry hurried off to give orders. Farmer Cotton cleared the street, \\nsending everyone indoors, except the older hobbits who had weapons of some \\nsort. They had not long to wait. Soon they could hear loud voices, and then \\nthe tramping of heavy feet. Presently a whole squad of the ruffians came \\ndown the road. They saw the barrier and laughed. They did not imagine that \\nthere was anything in this little land that would stand up to twenty of \\ntheir kind together. \\n\\nThe hobbits opened the barrier and stood aside. \\'Thank you!\\' the Men \\njeered. \\'Now run home to bed before you\\'re whipped.\\' Then they marched along \\nthe street shouting: \\'Put those lights out! Get indoors and stay there! Or \\nwe\\'ll take fifty of you to the Lockholes for a year. Get in! The Boss is \\nlosing his temper.\\' \\n\\nNo one paid any heed to their orders; but as the ruffians passed, they \\nclosed in quietly behind and followed them. When the Men reached the fire \\nthere was Farmer Cotton standing all alone warming his hands. \\n\\n\\'Who are you, and what d\\'you think you\\'re doing?\\' said the \\nruffian-leader. \\n\\nFarmer Cotton looked at him slowly. \\'I was just going to ask you that,\\' \\nhe said. \\'This isn\\'t your country, and you\\'re not wanted.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, you\\'re wanted anyhow,\\' said the leader. \\'We want you. Take him \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nlads! Lockholes for him, and give him something to keep him quiet!\\' \\n\\nThe Men took one step forward and stopped short. There rose a roar of \\nvoices all round them, and suddenly they were aware that Farmer Cotton was \\nnot all alone. They were surrounded. In the dark on the edge of the \\nfirelight stood a ring of hobbits that had crept up out of the shadows. \\n\\nThere was nearly two hundred of them, all holding some weapon. \\n\\nMerry stepped forward. \\'We have met before,\\' he said to the leader, \\n\\n\\'and I warned you not to come back here. I warn you again: you are standing \\nin the light and you are covered by archers. If you lay a finger on this \\nfarmer, or on anyone else, you will be shot at once. Lay down any weapons \\nthat you have!\\' \\n\\nThe leader looked round. He was trapped. But he was not scared, not now \\nwith a score of his fellows to back him. He knew too little of hobbits to \\nunderstand his peril. Foolishly he decided to fight. It would be easy to \\nbreak out. \\n\\n\\'At \\'em lads!\\' he cried. \\'Let \\'em have it!\\' \\n\\nWith a long knife in his left hand and a club in the other he made a \\nrush at the ring, trying to burst out back towards Hobbiton. He aimed a \\nsavage blow at Merry who stood in his way. He fell dead with four arrows in \\nhim: \\n\\nThat was enough for the others. They gave in. Their weapons were taken \\nfrom them, and they were roped together, and marched off to an empty hut \\nthat they had built themselves, and there they were tied hand and foot, and \\nlocked up under guard. The dead leader was dragged off and buried. \\n\\n\\'Seems almost too easy after all, don\\'t it?\\' said Cotton. \\'I said we \\ncould master them. But we needed a call. You came back in the nick o\\' time, \\nMr. Merry.\\' \\n\\n\\'There\\'s more to be done still,\\' said Merry. \\'If you\\'re right in your \\nreckoning, we haven\\'t dealt with a tithe of them yet. But it\\'s dark now. I \\nthink the next stroke must wait until morning. Then we must call on the \\nChief.\\' \\n\\n\\'Why not now?\\' said Sam. \\'It\\'s not much more than six o\\'clock. And I \\nwant to see my gaffer. D\\'you know what\\'s come of him, Mr. Cotton?\\' \\n\\n\\'He\\'s not too well, and not too bad, Sam,\\' said the farmer. \\'They dug \\nup Bagshot Row, and that was a sad blow to him. He\\'s in one of them new \\nhouses that the Chiefs Men used to build while they still did any work \\nother than burning and thieving: not above a mile from the end of By water. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut he comes around to me, when he gets a chance, and I see he\\'s better fed \\nthan some of the poor bodies. All against The Rules, of course. I\\'d have had \\nhim with me, but that wasn\\'t allowed.\\' \\n\\n\\'Thank\\'ee indeed, Mr. Cotton, and I\\'ll never forget it,\\' said Sam. \\'But \\nI want to see him. That Boss and that Sharkey, as they spoke of, they might \\ndo a mischief up there before the morning.\\' \\n\\n\\'All right, Sam,\\' said Cotton. \\'Choose a lad or two, and go and fetch \\nhim to my house. You\\'ll not have need to go near the old Hobbiton village \\nover Water. My Jolly here will show you.\\' \\n\\nSam went off. Merry arranged for look-outs round the village and guards \\nat the barriers during the night. Then he and Frodo went off with Farmer \\nCotton. They sat with the family in the warm kitchen, and the Cottons asked \\na few polite questions about their travels, but hardly listened to the \\nanswers: they were far more concerned with events in the Shire. \\n\\n\\'It all began with Pimple, as we call him,\\' said Farmer Cotton; \\'and it \\nbegan as soon as you\\'d gone off, Mr. Frodo. He\\'d funny ideas had Pimple. \\nSeems he wanted to own everything himself, and then order other folk about. \\n\\nIt soon came out that he already did own a sight more than was good for him; \\nand he was always grabbing more, though where he got the money was a \\nmystery: mills and malt-houses and inns, and farms, and leaf-plantations. \\n\\nHe\\'d already bought Sandyman\\'s mill before he came to Bag End, seemingly. \\n\\n\\'Of course he started with a lot of property in the Southfarthing which \\nhe had from his dad; and it seems he\\'d been selling a lot o\\' the best leaf, \\nand sending it away quietly for a year or two. But at the end o\\' last year \\nhe began sending away loads of stuff, not only leaf. Things began to get \\nshort, and winter coming on, too. Folk got angry, but he had his answer. A \\nlot of Men, ruffians mostly, came with great waggons, some to carry off the \\ngoods south-away, and others to stay. And more came. And before we knew \\nwhere we were they were planted here and there all over the Shire, and were \\nfelling trees and digging and building themselves sheds and houses just as \\nthey liked. At first goods and damage was paid for by Pimple; but soon they \\nbegan lording it around and taking what they wanted. \\n\\n\\'Then there was a bit of trouble, but not enough. Old Will the Mayor \\nset off for Bag End to protest, but he never got there. Ruffians laid hands \\non him and took and locked him up in a hole in Michel Delving, and there he \\nis now. And after that, it would be soon after New Year, there wasn\\'t no \\nmore Mayor, and Pimple called himself Chief Shirriff, or just Chief, and did \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nas he liked; and if anyone got \"uppish\" as they called it, they followed \\nWill. So things went from bad to worse. There wasn\\'t no smoke left, save for \\nthe Men; and the Chief didn\\'t hold with beer, save for his Men, and closed \\nall the inns; and everything except Rules got shorter and shorter, unless \\none could hide a bit of one\\'s own when the ruffians went round gathering \\nstuff up \"for fair distribution\": which meant they got it and we didn\\'t, \\nexcept for the leavings which you could have at the Shirriff-houses, if you \\ncould stomach them. All very bad. But since Sharkey came it\\'s been plain \\nruination.\\' \\n\\n\\'Who is this Sharkey?\\' said Merry. \\'I heard one of the ruffians speak \\nof him.\\' \\n\\n\\'The biggest ruffian o\\' the lot, seemingly,\\' answered Cotton. \\'It was \\nabout last harvest, end o\\' September maybe, that we first heard of him. \\nWe\\'ve never seen him, but he\\'s up at Bag End; and he\\'s the real Chief now, I \\nguess. All the ruffians do what he says; and what he says is mostly hack, \\nburn, and ruin; and now it s come to killing. There s no longer even any bad \\nsense in it. They cut down trees and let \\'em lie, they burn houses and build \\nno more. \\n\\n\\'Take Sandyman\\'s mill now. Pimple knocked it down almost as soon as he \\ncame to Bag End. Then he brought in a lot o\\' dirty -looking Men to build a \\nbigger one and fill it full o\\' wheels and outlandish contraptions. Only that \\nfool Ted was pleased by that, and he works there cleaning wheels for the \\nMen, where his dad was the Miller and his own master. Pimple\\'s idea was to \\ngrind more and faster, or so he said. He\\'s got other mills like it. But \\nyou\\'ve got to have grist before you can grind; and there was no more for the \\nnew mill to do than for the old. But since Sharkey came they don\\'t grind no \\nmore corn at all. They\\'re always a-hammering and a-letting out a smoke and a \\nstench, and there isn\\'t no peace even at night in Hobbiton. And they pour \\nout filth a purpose; they\\'ve fouled all the lower Water and it\\'s getting \\ndown into Brandywine. If they want to make the Shire into a desert, they\\'re \\ngoing the right way about it. I don\\'t believe that fool of a Pimple\\'s behind \\nall this. It\\'s Sharkey, I say.\\' \\n\\n\\'That\\'s right!\\' put in Young Tom. \\'Why, they even took Pimple\\'s old ma, \\nthat Lobelia, and he was fond of her, if no one else was. Some of the \\nHobbiton folk, they saw it. She comes down the lane with her old umbrella. \\nSome of the ruffians were going up with a big cart. \\n\\n\\' \"Where be you a-going?\" says she. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\' \"To Bag End,\" says they. \\n\\n\\' \"What for?\" says she. \\n\\n\\' \"To put up some sheds for Sharkey,\" says they. \\n\\n\\' \"Who said you could?\" says she. \\n\\n\\' \"Sharkey,\" says they. \"So get out o\\' the road, old hagling!\" \\n\\n\\' \"I\\'ll give you Sharkey, you dirty thieving ruffians!\" says she, and \\nups with her umbrella and goes for the leader, near twice her size. So they \\ntook her. Dragged her off to the Lockholes, at her age too. They\\'ve took \\nothers we miss more, but there\\'s no denying she showed more spirit than \\nmost.\\' \\n\\nInto the middle of this talk came Sam, bursting in with his gaffer. Old \\nGamgee did not look much older, but he was a little deafer. \\n\\n\\'Good evening. Mr. Baggins!\\' he said. \\'Glad indeed I am to see you safe \\nback. But I\\'ve a bone to pick with you, in a manner o\\' speaking, if I may \\nmake so bold. You didn\\'t never ought to have a\\' sold Bag End, as I always \\nsaid. That\\'s what started all the mischief. And while you\\'re been trapessing \\nin foreign parts, chasing Black Men up mountains from what my Sam says, \\nthough what for he don\\'t make clear, they\\'ve been and dug up Bagshot Row and \\nruined my taters!\\' \\n\\n\\'I am very sorry, Mr. Gamgee,\\' said Frodo. \\'But now I\\'ve come back, \\n\\nI\\'ll do my best to make amends.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, you can\\'t say fairer than that,\\' said the gaffer. \\'Mr. Frodo \\nBaggins is a real gentlehobbit, I always have said, whatever you may think \\nof some others of the name, begging your pardon. And I hope my Sam\\'s \\nbehaved \\n\\nhisself and given satisfaction?\\' \\n\\n\\'Perfect satisfaction, Mr. Gamgee,\\' said Frodo. \\'Indeed, if you will \\nbelieve it, he\\'s now one of the most famous people in all the lands, and \\nthey are making songs about his deeds from here to the Sea and beyond the \\nGreat River.\\' Sam blushed, but he looked gratefully at Frodo, for Rosie\\'s \\neyes were shining and she was smiling at him. \\n\\n\\'It takes a lot o\\' believing,\\' said the gaffer, \\'though I can see he\\'s \\nbeen mixing in strange company. What\\'s come of his weskit? I don\\'t hold with \\nwearing ironmongery, whether it wears well or no.\\' \\n\\nFarmer Cotton\\'s household and all his guests were up early next \\nmorning. Nothing had been heard in the night, but more trouble would \\ncertainly come before the day was old. \\'Seems as if none o\\' the ruffians \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwere left up at Bag End,\\' said Cotton; \\'but the gang from Waymeet will be \\nalong any time now.\\' \\n\\nAfter breakfast a messenger from the Tookland rode in. He was in high \\nspirits. \\'The Thain has raised all our country,\\' he said, \\'and the news is \\ngoing like fire all ways. The ruffians that were watching our land have fled \\noff south, those that escaped alive. The Thain has gone after them, to hold \\noff the big gang down that way; but he\\'s sent Mr Peregrin back with all the \\nother folk he can spare.\\' \\n\\nThe next news was less good. Merry, who had been out all night, came \\nriding in about ten o\\'clock. \\'There\\'s a big band about four miles away,\\' he \\nsaid. \\'They\\'re coming along the road from Waymeet, but a good many stray \\nruffians have joined up with them. There must be close on a hundred of them; \\nand they\\'re fire-raising as they come. Curse them!\\' \\n\\n\\'Ah! This lot won\\'t stay to talk, they\\'ll kill, if they can,\\' said \\nFarmer Cotton. \\'If Tooks don\\'t come sooner, we\\'d best get behind cover and \\nshoot without arguing. There\\'s got to be some fighting before this is \\nsettled, Mr. Frodo.\\' \\n\\nThe Tooks did come sooner. Before long they marched in, a hundred \\nstrong, from Tuckborough and the Green Hills with Pippin at their head. \\nMerry now had enough sturdy hobbitry to deal with the ruffians. Scouts \\nreported that they were keeping close together. They knew that the \\ncountryside had risen against them, and plainly meant to deal with the \\nrebellion ruthlessly, at its centre in Bywater. But however grim they, might \\nbe, they seemed to have no leader among them who understood warfare. \\nThey \\n\\ncame on without any precautions. Merry laid his plans quickly. \\n\\nThe ruffians came tramping along the East Road, and without halting \\nturned up the Bywater Road, which ran for some way sloping up between \\nhigh \\n\\nbanks with low hedges on top. Round a bend, about a furlong from the main \\nroad, they met a stout barrier of old farm-carts upturned. That halted them. \\n\\nAt the same moment they became aware that the hedges on both sides, just \\nabove their heads, were all lined with hobbits. Behind them other hobbits \\nnow pushed out some more waggons that had been hidden in a field, and so \\nblocked the way back. A voice spoke to them from above. \\n\\n\\'Well, you have walked into a trap,\\' said Merry. \\'Your fellows from \\nHobbiton did the same, and one is dead and the rest are prisoners. Fay down \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyour weapons ! Then go back twenty paces and sit down. Any who try to \\nbreak \\n\\nout will be shot.\\' \\n\\nBut the ruffians could not now be cowed so easily. A few of them \\nobeyed, but were immediately set on by their fellows. A score or more broke \\nback and charged the waggons. Six were shot, but the remainder burst out, \\nkilling two hobbits, and then scattering across country in the direction of \\nthe Woody End. Two more fell as they ran. Merry blew a loud horn-call, and \\nthere were answering calls from a distance. \\n\\n\\'They won\\'t get far,\\' said Pippin. \\'All that country is alive with our \\nhunters now.\\' \\n\\nBehind, the trapped Men in the lane, still about four score, tried to \\nclimb the barrier and the banks, and the hobbits were obliged to shoot many \\nof them or hew them with axes. But many of the strongest and most desperate \\ngot out on the west side, and attacked their enemies fiercely, being now \\nmore bent on killing than escaping. Several hobbits fell, and the rest were \\nwavering, when Merry and Pippin, who were on the east side, came across and \\ncharged the ruffians. Merry himself slew the leader, a great squint-eyed \\nbrute like a huge ore. Then he drew his forces off, encircling the last \\nremnant of the Men in a wide ring of archers. \\n\\nAt last all was over. Nearly seventy of the ruffians lay dead on the \\nfield, and a dozen were prisoners. Nineteen hobbits were killed, and some \\nthirty were wounded. The dead ruffians were laden on waggons and hauled off \\nto an old sand-pit nearby and there buried: in the Battle Pit, as it was \\nafterwards called. The fallen hobbits were laid together in a grave on the \\nhill-side, where later a great stone was set up with a garden about it. So \\nended the Battle of By water, 1419, the last battle fought in the Shire, and \\nthe only battle since the Greenfields, 1147, away up in the Northfarthing. \\n\\nIn consequence, though it happily cost very few lives, it has a chapter to \\nitself in the Red Book, and the names of all those who took part were made \\ninto a Roll, and learned by heart by Shire-historians. The very considerable \\nrise in the fame and fortune of the Cottons dates from this time; but at the \\ntop of the Roll in all accounts stand the names of Captains Meriadoc and \\nPeregrin. \\n\\nFrodo had been in the battle, but he had not drawn sword, and his chief \\npart had been to prevent the hobbits in their wrath at their losses, from \\nslaying those of their enemies who threw down their weapons. When the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfighting was over, and the later labours were ordered, Merry, Pippin, and \\nSam joined him, and they rode back with the Cottons. They ate a late midday \\nmeal, and then Frodo said with a sigh: \\'Well, I suppose it is time now that \\nwe dealt with the \"Chief\".\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes indeed; the sooner the better,\\' said Merry. \\'And don\\'t be too \\ngentle! He\\'s responsible for bringing in these ruffians, and for all the \\nevil they have done.\\' \\n\\nFarmer Cotton collected an escort of some two dozen sturdy hobbits. \\n\\n\\'For it\\'s only a guess that there is no ruffians left at Bag End,\\' he said. \\n\\n\\'We don\\'t know.\\' Then they set out on foot. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin \\nled the way. \\n\\nIt was one of the saddest hours in their lives. The great chimney rose \\nup before them; and as they drew near the old village across the Water, \\nthrough rows of new mean houses along each side of the road, they saw the \\nnew mill in all its frowning and dirty ugliness: a great brick building \\nstraddling the stream, which it fouled with a steaming and stinking \\noverflow. All along the By water Road every tree had been felled. \\n\\nAs they crossed the bridge and looked up the Hill they gasped. Even \\nSam\\'s vision in the Mirror had not prepared him for what they saw. The Old \\nGrange on the west side had been knocked down, and its place taken by rows \\nof tarred sheds. All the chestnuts were gone. The banks and hedgerows were \\nbroken. Great waggons were standing in disorder in a field beaten bare of \\ngrass. Bagshot Row was a yawning sand and gravel quarry. Bag End up. \\nbeyond \\n\\ncould not be seen for a clutter of large huts. \\n\\n\\'They\\'ve cut it down!\\' cried Sam. \\'They\\'ve cut down the Party Tree!\\' He \\npointed to where the tree, had stood under which Bilbo had made his Farewell \\nSpeech. It was lying lopped and dead in the field. As if this was the last \\nstraw Sam burst into tears. \\n\\nA laugh put an end to them. There was a surly hobbit lounging over the \\nlow wall of the mill-yard. He was grimy -faced and black-handed. \\'Don\\'t \\'ee \\nlike it, Sam?\\' he sneered. \\'But you always was soft. I thought you\\'d gone \\noff in one o\\' them ships you used to prattle about, sailing, sailing. What \\nd\\'you want to come back for? We\\'ve work to do in the Shire now.\\' \\n\\n\\'So I see,\\' said Sam. \\'No time for washing, but time for wall -propping. \\n\\nBut see here, Master Sandy man, I\\'ve a score to pay in this village, and \\ndon\\'t you make it any longer with your jeering, or you\\'ll foot a bill too \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbig for your purse.\\' \\n\\nTed Sandyman spat over the wall: \\'Garn!\\' he said. \\'You can\\'t touch me. \\n\\nI\\'m a friend o\\' the Boss\\'s. But he\\'ll touch you all right, if I have any \\nmore of your mouth.\\' \\n\\n\\'Don\\'t waste any more words on the fool, Sam!\\' said Frodo. \\'I hope \\nthere are not many more hobbits that have become like this. It would be a \\nworse trouble than all the damage the Men have done.\\' \\n\\n\\'You are dirty and insolent, Sandyman,\\' said Merry. \\'And also very much \\nout of your reckoning. We are just going up the Hill to remove your precious \\nBoss. We have dealt with his Men.\\' \\n\\nTed gaped, for at that moment he first caught sight of the escort that \\nat a sign from Merry now marched over the bridge. Dashing back into the mill \\nhe ran out with a horn and blew it loudly. \\n\\n\\'Save your breath!\\' laughed Merry. \\'I\\'ve a better.\\' Then lifting up his \\nsilver horn he winded it, and its clear call rang over the Hill; and out of \\nthe holes and sheds and shabby houses of Hobbiton the hobbits answered, and \\ncame pouring out, and with cheers and loud cries they followed the company \\nup the road to Bag End. \\n\\nAt the top of the lane the party halted, and Frodo and his friends went \\non; and they came at last to the once beloved place. The garden was full of \\nhuts and sheds, some so near the old westward windows that they cut off all \\ntheir light. There were piles of refuse everywhere. The door was scarred; \\nthe bell-chain was dangling loose, and the bell would not ring. Knocking \\nbrought no answer. At length they pushed and the door yielded. They went in. \\nThe place stank and was full of filth and disorder: it did not appear to \\nhave been used for some time. \\n\\n\\'Where is that miserable Lotho hiding?\\' said Merry. They had searched \\nevery room and found no living thing save rats and mice. \\'Shall we turn on \\nthe others to search the sheds?\\' \\n\\n\\'This is worse than Mordor!\\' said Sam. \\'Much worse in a way. It comes \\nhome to you, as they say; because it is home, and you remember it before it \\nwas all ruined.\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, this is Mordor,\\' said Frodo. \\'Just one of its works. Saruman was \\ndoing its work all the time, even when he thought he was working for \\nhimself. And the same with those that Saruman tricked, like Lotho.\\' \\n\\nMerry looked round in dismay and disgust. \\'Let\\'s get out!\\' he said. \\'If \\nI had known all the mischief he had caused, I should have stuffed my pouch \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndown Saruman\\'s throat.\\' \\n\\n\\'No doubt, no doubt! But you did not, and so I am able to welcome you \\nhome.\\' There standing at the door was Saruman himself, looking well-fed and \\nwell-pleased; his eyes gleamed with malice and amusement. \\n\\nA sudden light broke on Frodo. \\'Sharkey!\\' he cried. \\n\\nSaruman laughed. \\'So you have heard the name, have you? All my people \\nused to call me that in Isengard, I believe. A sign of affection, possibly. ( \\n\\nBut evidently you did not expect to see me here.\\' \\n\\n\\'I did not,\\' said Frodo. \\'But I might have guessed. A little mischief \\nin a mean way: Gandalf warned me that you were still capable of it. \\n\\n\\'Quite capable,\\' said Saruman, \\'and more than a little. You made me \\nlaugh, you hobbit-lordlings, riding along with all those great people so \\nsecure and so pleased with your little selves. You thought you had done very \\nwell out of it all, and could now just amble back and have a nice quiet time \\nin the country. Saruman\\'s home could be all wrecked, and he could be turned \\nout, but no one could touch yours. Oh no! Gandalf would look after your \\naffairs.\\' \\n\\nSaruman laughed again. \\'Not he! When his tools have done their task he \\ndrops them. But you must go dangling after him, dawdling and talking, and \\nriding round twice as far as you needed. \"Well,\" thought I, \"if they\\'re such \\nfools, I will get ahead of them and teach them a lesson. One ill turn \\ndeserves another.\" It would have been a sharper lesson, if only you had \\ngiven me a little more time and more Men. Still I have already done much \\nthat you will find it hard to mend or undo in your lives. And it will be \\npleasant to think of that and set it against my injuries.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, if that is what you find pleasure in,\\' said Frodo, \\'I pity you. \\n\\nIt will be a pleasure of memory only, I fear. Go at once and never return!\\' \\n\\nThe hobbits of the villages had seen Saruman come out of one of the \\nhuts, and at once they came crowding up to the door of Bag End. When they \\nheard Frodo\\'s command, they murmured angrily: \\n\\n\\'Don\\'t let him go! Kill him! He\\'s a villain and a murderer. Kill him!\\' \\n\\nSaruman looked round at their hostile faces and smiled. \\'Kill him!\\' he \\nmocked. \\'Kill him, if you think there are enough of you, my brave hobbits!\\' \\nHe drew himself up and stared at them darkly with his black eyes. \\'But do \\nnot think that when I lost all my goods I lost all my power! Whoever strikes \\nme shall be accursed. And if my blood stains the Shire, it shall wither and \\nnever again be healed.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe hobbits recoiled. But Frodo said: \\'Do not believe him! He has lost \\nall power, save his voice that can still daunt you and deceive you, if you \\nlet it. But I will not have him slain. It is useless to meet revenge with \\nrevenge: it will heal nothing. Go, Saruman, by the speediest way!\\' \\n\\n\\'Worm! Worm!\\' Saruman called; and out of a nearby hut came \\nWormtongue, \\n\\ncrawling, almost like a dog. To the road again, Worm!\\' said Saruman. \\'These \\nfine fellows and lordlings are turning us adrift again. Come along!\\' \\n\\nSaruman turned to go, and Wormtongue shuffled after him. But even as \\nSaruman passed close to Frodo a knife flashed in his hand, and he stabbed \\nswiftly. The blade turned on the hidden mail-coat and snapped. A dozen \\nhobbits, led by Sam, leaped forward with a cry and flung the villain to the \\nground. Sam drew his sword. \\n\\n\\'No, Sam!\\' said Frodo. \\'Do not kill him even now. For he has not hurt \\nme. And in any case I do not wish him to be slain in this evil mood. He was \\ngreat once, of a noble kind that we should not dare to raise our hands \\nagainst. He is fallen, and his cure is beyond us; but I would still spare \\nhim, in the hope that he may find it.\\' \\n\\nSaruman rose to his feet, and stared at Frodo. There was a strange look \\nin his eyes of mingled wonder and respect and hatred. \\'You have grown, \\nHalfling,\\' he said. \\'Yes, you have grown very much. You are wise, and cruel. \\nYou have robbed my revenge of sweetness, and now I must go hence in \\nbitterness, in debt to your mercy. I hate it and you! Well, I go and I will \\ntrouble you no more. But do not expect me to wish you health and long life. \\nYou will have neither. But that is not my doing. I merely foretell.\\' \\n\\nHe walked away, and the hobbits made a lane for him to pass; but their \\nknuckles whitened as they gripped on their weapons. Wormtongue hesitated, \\nand then followed his master. \\n\\n\\'Wormtongue!\\' called Frodo. \\'You need not follow him. I know of no evil \\nyou have done to me. You can have rest and food here for a while, until you \\nare stronger and can go your own ways.\\' \\n\\nWormtongue halted and looked back at him, half prepared to stay. \\nSaruman turned. \\'No evil?\\' he cackled. \\'Oh no! Even when he sneaks out at \\nnight it is only to look at the stars. But did I hear someone ask where poor \\nLotho is hiding? You know, don\\'t you, Worm? Will you tell them?\\' \\n\\nWormtongue cowered down and whimpered: \\'No, no!\\' \\n\\n\\'Then I will,\\' said Saruman. \\'Worm killed your Chief, poor little \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfellow, your nice little Boss. Didn\\'t you, Worm? Stabbed him in his sleep, I \\nbelieve. Buried him, I hope; though Worm has been very hungry lately. No, \\nWorm is not really nice. You had better leave him to me.\\' \\n\\nA look of wild hatred came into Wormtongue\\'s red eyes. \\'You told me to; \\nyou made me do it,\\' he hissed. \\n\\nSaruman laughed. \\'You do what Sharkey says, always, don\\'t you, Worm? \\nWell, now he says: follow!\\' He kicked Wormtongue in the face as he \\ngrovelled, and turned and made off. But at that something snapped: suddenly \\nWormtongue rose up, drawing a hidden knife, and then with a snarl like a dog \\nhe sprang on Saruman\\'s back, jerked his head back, cut his throat, and with \\na yell ran off down the lane. Before Frodo could recover or speak a word, \\nthree hobbit-bows twanged and Wormtongue fell dead. \\n\\nTo the dismay of those that stood by, about the body of Saruman a grey \\nmist gathered, and rising slowly to a great height like smoke from a fire, \\nas a pale shrouded figure it loomed over the Hill. For a moment it wavered, \\nlooking to the West; but out of the West came a cold wind, and it bent away, \\nand with a sigh dissolved into nothing. \\n\\nFrodo looked down at the body with pity and horror, for as he looked it \\nseemed that long years of death were suddenly revealed in it, and it shrank, \\nand the shrivelled face became rags of skin upon a hideous skull. Lifting up \\nthe skirt of the dirty cloak that sprawled beside it, he covered it over, \\nand turned away. \\n\\n\\'And that\\'s the end of that,\\' said Sam. \\'A nasty end, and I wish I \\nneedn\\'t have seen it; but it\\'s a good riddance.\\' \\n\\n\\'And the very last end of the War, I hope,\\' said Merry. \\n\\n\\'I hope so,\\' said Frodo and sighed. \\'The very last stroke. But to think \\nthat it should fall here, at the very door of Bag End! Among all my hopes \\nand fears at least I never expected that.\\' \\n\\n\\'I shan\\'t call it the end, till we\\'ve cleared up the mess,\\' said Sam \\ngloomily. \\'And that\\'ll take a lot of time and work.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 9 . The Grey Havens \\n\\n\\n\\nThe clearing up certainly needed a lot of work, but it took less time \\nthan Sam had feared. The day after the battle Frodo rode to Michel Delving \\nand released the prisoners from the Lockholes. One of the first that they \\nfound was poor Fredegar Bolger, Fatty no longer. He had been taken when the \\nruffians smoked out a band of rebels that he led from their hidings up in \\nthe Brockenbores by the hills of Scary. \\n\\n\\'You would have done better to come with us after all, poor old \\nFredegar!\\' said Pippin, as they carried him out too weak to walk. \\n\\nHe opened an eye and tried gallantly to smile. \\'Who\\'s this young giant \\nwith the loud voice?\\' he whispered. \\'Not little Pippin! What\\'s your size in \\nhats now?\\' \\n\\nThen there was Lobelia. Poor thing, she looked very old and thin when \\nthey rescued her from a dark and narrow cell. She insisted on hobbling out \\non her own feet; and she had such a welcome, and there was such clapping and \\ncheering when she appeared, leaning on Frodo\\'s arm but still clutching her \\numbrella, that she was quite touched, and drove away in tears. She had never \\nin her life been popular before. But she was crushed by the news of Lotho\\'s \\nmurder, and she would\\' not return to Bag End. She gave it back to Frodo, and \\nwent to her own people, the Bracegirdles of Hardbottle. \\n\\nWhen the poor creature died next Spring-she was after all more than a \\nhundred years old - Frodo was surprised and much moved: she had left all \\nthat remained of her money and of Lotho\\'s for him to use in helping hobbits \\nmade homeless by the troubles. So that feud was ended. \\n\\nOld Will Whitfoot had been in the Lockholes longer than any, and though \\nhe had perhaps been treated less harshly than some, he needed a lot of \\nfeeding up before he could look the part of Mayor; so Frodo agreed to act as \\nhis Deputy, until Mr. Whitfoot was in shape again. The only thing that he \\ndid as Deputy Mayor was to reduce the Shirriffs to their proper functions \\nand numbers. The task of hunting out the last remnant of the ruffians was \\nleft to Merry and Pippin, and it was soon done. The southern gangs, after \\nhearing the news of the Battle of By water, fled out of the land and offered \\nlittle resistance to the Thain. Before the Year\\'s End the few survivors were \\nrounded up in the woods, and those that surrendered were shown to the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nborders. \\n\\nMeanwhile the labour of repair went on apace, and Sam was kept very \\nbusy. Hobbits can work like bees when the mood and the need comes on \\nthem. \\n\\nNow there were thousands of willing hands of all ages, from the small but \\nnimble ones of the hobbit lads and lasses to the well-worn and horny ones of \\nthe gaffers and gammers. Before Yule not a brick was left standing of the \\nnew Shirriff-houses or of anything that had been built by \\'Sharkey\\'s Men\\'; \\nbut the bricks were used to repair many an old hole, to make it snugger and \\ndrier. Great stores of goods and food, and beer, were found that had been \\nhidden away by the ruffians in sheds and barns and deserted holes, and \\nespecially in the tunnels at Michel Delving and in the old quarries at \\nScary; so that there was a great deal better cheer that Yule than anyone had \\nhoped for. \\n\\nOne of the first things done in Hobbiton, before even the removal of \\nthe new mill, was the clearing of the Hill and Bag End, and the restoration \\nof Bagshot Row. The front of the new sand-pit was all levelled and made into \\na large sheltered garden, and new holes were dug in the southward face, back \\ninto the Hill, and they were lined with brick. The Gaffer was restored to \\nNumber Three; and he said often and did not care who heard it: \\n\\n\\'It\\'s an ill wind as blows nobody no good, as I always say. And All\\'s \\nwell as ends Better!\\' \\n\\nThere was some discussion of the name that the new row should be given. \\nBattle Gardens was thought of, or Better Smials. But after a while in \\nsensible hobbit-fashion it was just called New Row. It was a purely Bywater \\njoke to refer to it as Sharkey\\'s End. \\n\\nThe trees were the worst loss and damage, for at Sharkey\\'s bidding they \\nhad been cut down recklessly far and wide over the Shire; and Sam grieved \\nover this more than anything else. For one thing, this hurt would take long \\nto heal, and only his great-grandchildren, he thought, would see the Shire \\nas it ought to be. \\n\\nThen suddenly one day, for he had been too busy for weeks to give a \\nthought to his adventures, he remembered the gift of Galadriel. He brought \\nthe box out and showed it to the other Travellers (for so they were now \\ncalled by everyone), and asked their advice. \\n\\n\\'I wondered when you would think of it,\\' said Frodo. \\'Open it!\\' \\n\\nInside it was filled with a grey dust, soft and fine, in the middle of \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhich was a seed, like a small nut with a silver shale. \\'What can I do with \\nthis?\\' said Sam. \\n\\n\\'Throw it in the air on a breezy day and let it do its work!\\' said \\nPippin. \\n\\n\\'On what?\\' said Sam. \\n\\n\\'Choose one spot as a nursery, and see what happens to the plants \\nthere,\\' said Merry. \\n\\n\\'But I\\'m sure the Lady would not like me to keep it all for my own \\ngarden, now so many folk have suffered,\\' said Sam. \\n\\n\\'Use all the wits and knowledge you have of your own, Sam,\\' said Frodo, \\n\\'and then use the gift to help your work and better it. And use it \\nsparingly. There is not much here, and I expect every grain has a value.\\' \\n\\nSo Sam planted saplings in all the places where specially beautiful or \\nbeloved trees had been destroyed, and he put a grain of the precious dust in \\nthe soil at the root of each. He went up and down the Shire in this labour; \\nbut if he paid special attention to Hobbiton and By water no one blamed him. \\nAnd at the end he found that he still had a little of the dust left; so he \\nwent to the Three-Farthing Stone, which is as near the centre of the Shire \\nas no matter, and cast it in the air with his blessing. The little silver \\nnut he planted in the Party Field where the tree had once been; and he \\nwondered what would come of it. All through the winter he remained as \\npatient as he could, and tried to restrain himself from going round \\nconstantly to see if anything was happening. \\n\\nSpring surpassed his wildest hopes. His trees began to sprout and grow, \\nas if time was in a hurry and wished to make one year do for twenty. In the \\nParty Field a beautiful young sapling leaped up: it had silver bark and long \\nleaves and burst into golden flowers in April. It was indeed a mallorn, and \\nit was the wonder of the neighbourhood. In after years, as it grew in grace \\nand beauty, it was known far and wide and people would come long journeys \\nto \\n\\nsee it: the only mallorn west of the Mountains and east of the Sea, and one \\nof the finest in the world. \\n\\nAltogether 1420 in the Shire was a marvellous year. Not only was there \\nwonderful sunshine and delicious rain, in due times and perfect measure, but \\nthere seemed something more: an air of richness and growth, and a gleam of a \\nbeauty beyond that of mortal summers that flicker and pass upon this \\nMiddle -earth. All the children born or begotten in that year, and there were \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmany, were fair to see and strong, and most of them had a rich golden hair \\nthat had before been rare among hobbits. The fruit was so plentiful that \\nyoung hobbits very nearly bathed in strawberries and cream; and later they \\nsat on the lawns under the plum-trees and ate, until they had made piles of \\nstones like small pyramids or the heaped skulls of a conqueror, and then \\nthey moved on. And no one was ill, and everyone was pleased, except those \\nwho had to mow the grass. \\n\\nIn the Southfarthing the vines were laden, and the yield of \\'leaf was \\nastonishing; and everywhere there was so much corn that at Harvest every \\nbarn was stuffed. \\'The Northfarthing barley was so fine that the beer of \\n1420 malt was long remembered and became a byword. Indeed a generation \\nlater \\n\\none might hear an old gaffer in an inn, after a good pint of well-earned \\nale, put down his mug with a sigh: \\'Ah! that was proper fourteen-twenty, \\nthat was!\\' \\n\\nSam stayed at first at the Cottons\\' with Frodo; but when the New Row \\nwas ready he went with the Gaffer. In addition to all his other labours he \\nwas busy directing the cleaning up and restoring of Bag End; but he was \\noften away in the Shire on his forestry work. So he was not at home in early \\nMarch and did not know that Frodo had been ill. On the thirteenth of that \\nmonth Farmer Cotton found Frodo lying on his bed; he was clutching a white \\ngem that hung on a chain about his neck and he seemed half in a dream. \\n\\n\\'It is gone for ever,\\' he said, \\'and now all is dark and empty.\\' \\n\\nBut the fit passed, and when Sam got back on the twenty -fifth, Frodo \\nhad recovered, and he said nothing about himself. In the meanwhile Bag End \\nhad been set in order, and Merry and Pippin came over from Crickhollow \\nbringing back all the old furniture and gear, so that the old hole soon \\nlooked very much as it always had done. \\n\\nWhen all was at last ready Frodo said: \\'When are you going to move in \\nand join me, Sam?\\' \\n\\nSam looked a bit awkward. \\n\\n\\'There is no need to come yet, if you don\\'t want to,\\' said Frodo. \\'But \\nyou know the Gaffer is close at hand, and he will be very well looked after \\nby Widow Rumble.\\' \\n\\nIt s not that, Mr. Frodo, said Sam, and he went ver red. \\n\\n\\'Well, what is it?\\' \\n\\n\\'It\\'s Rosie, Rose Cotton,\\' said Sam. \\'It seems she didn\\'t like my going \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nabroad at all, poor lass; but as I hadn\\'t spoken, she couldn\\'t say so. And I \\ndidn\\'t speak, because I had a job to do first. But now I have spoken, and \\nshe says: \"Well, you\\'ve wasted a year, so why wait longer?\" \"Wasted?\" I \\nsays. \"I wouldn\\'t call it that.\" Still I see what she means. I feel torn in \\ntwo, as you might say.\\' \\n\\n\\'I see,\\' said Frodo: \\'you want to get married, and yet you want to live \\nwith me in Bag End too? But my dear Sam, how easy! Get married as soon as \\nyou can, and then move in with Rosie. There\\'s room enough in Bag End for as \\nbig a family as you could wish for.\\' \\n\\nAnd so it was settled. Sam Gamgee married Rose Cotton in the Spring of \\n1420 (which was also famous for its weddings), and they came and lived at \\nBag End. And if Sam thought himself lucky, Frodo knew that he was more \\nlucky \\n\\nhimself; for there was not a hobbit in the Shire that was looked after with \\nsuch care. When the labours of repair had all been planned and set going he \\ntook to a quiet life, writing a great deal and going through all his notes. \\n\\nEle resigned the office of Deputy Mayor at the Free Fair that mid-summer, and \\ndear old Will Whitfoot had another seven years of presiding at Banquets. \\n\\nMerry and Pippin lived together for some time at Crickhollow, and there \\nwas much coming and going between Buckland and Bag End. The two \\nyoung \\n\\nTravellers cut a great dash in the Shire with their songs and their tales \\nand their finery, and their wonderful parties. \\'Lordly\\' folk called them, \\nmeaning nothing but good; for it warmed all hearts to see them go riding by \\nwith their mail-shirts so bright and their shields so splendid, laughing and \\nsinging songs of far away; and if they were now large and magnificent, they \\nwere unchanged otherwise, unless they were indeed more fairspoken and \\nmore \\n\\njovial and full of merriment than ever before. \\n\\nFrodo and Sam, however, went back to ordinary attire, except that when \\nthere was need they both wore long grey cloaks, finely woven and clasped at \\nthe throat with beautiful brooches; and Mr. Frodo wore always a white jewel \\non a chain that he often would finger. \\n\\nAll things now went well, with hope always of becoming still better; \\nand Sam was as busy and as full of delight as even a hobbit could wish. \\nNothing for him marred that whole year, except for some vague anxiety about \\nhis master. Frodo dropped quietly out of all the doings of the Shire, and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSam was pained to notice how little honour he had in his own country. Few \\npeople knew or wanted to know about his deeds and adventures; their \\nadmiration and respect were given mostly to Mr. Meriadoc and Mr. Peregrin \\nand (if Sam had known it) to himself. Also in the autumn there appeared a \\nshadow of old troubles. \\n\\nOne evening Sam came into the study and found his master looking very \\nstrange. He was very pale and his eyes seemed to see things far away. \\n\\n\\'What\\'s the matter, Mr. Frodo?\\' said Sam. \\n\\n\\'I am wounded,\\' he answered, \\'wounded; it will never really heal.\\' \\n\\nBut then he got up, and the turn seemed to pass, and he was quite \\nhimself the next day. It was not until afterwards that Sam recalled that the \\ndate was October the sixth. Two years before on that day it was dark in the \\ndell under Weathertop. \\n\\nTime went on, and 1421 came in. Frodo was ill again in March, but with \\na great effort he concealed it, for Sam had other things to think about. The \\nfirst of Sam and Rosie\\'s children was born on the twenty-fifth of March, a \\ndate that Sam noted. \\n\\n\\'Well, Mr. Frodo,\\' he said. \\'I\\'m in a bit of a fix. Rose and me had \\nsettled to call him Frodo, with your leave; but it\\'s not him, it\\'s her. \\n\\nThough as pretty a maidchild as any one could hope for, taking after Rose \\nmore than me, luckily. So we don\\'t know what to do.\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, Sam,\\' said Frodo, \\'what\\'s wrong with the old customs? Choose a \\nflower name like Rose. Half the maidchildren in the Shire are called by such \\nnames, and what could be better?\\' \\n\\n\\'I suppose you\\'re right, Mr. Frodo,\\' said Sam. \\'I\\'ve heard some \\nbeautiful names on my travels, but I suppose they\\'re a bit too grand for \\ndaily wear and tear, as you might say. The Gaffer, he says: \"Make it short, \\nand then you won\\'t have to cut it short before you can use it.\" But if it\\'s \\nto be a flower-name, then I don\\'t trouble about the length: it must be a \\nbeautiful flower, because, you see, I think she is very beautiful, and is \\ngoing to be beautifuller still.\\' \\n\\nFrodo thought for a moment. \\'Well, Sam, what about elanor, the \\nsun-star, you remember the little golden flower in the grass of Lothlurien?\\' \\n\\n\\'You\\'re right again, Mr. Frodo!\\' said Sam delighted. \\'That\\'s what I \\nwanted.\\' \\n\\nLittle Elanor was nearly six months old, and 1421 had passed to its \\nautumn, when Frodo called Sam into the study. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'It will be Bilbo\\'s Birthday on Thursday, Sam,\\' he said. \\'And he will \\npass the Old Took. He will be a hundred and thirty-one!\\' \\n\\n\\'So he will!\\' said Sam. \\'He\\'s a marvel!\\' \\n\\n\\'Well, Sam,\\' said Frodo. \\'I want you to see Rose and find out if she \\ncan spare you, so that you and I can go off together. You can\\'t go far or \\nfor a long time now, of course,\\' he said a little wistfully. \\n\\n\\'Well, not very well, Mr. Frodo.\\' \\n\\n\\'Of course not. But never mind. You can see me on my way. Tell Rose \\nthat you won\\'t be away very long, not more than a fortnight; and you\\'ll come \\nback quite safe.\\' \\n\\n\\'I wish I could go all the way with you to Rivendell, Mr. Frodo, and \\nsee Mr. Bilbo,\\' said Sam. \\'And yet the only place I really want to be in is \\nhere. I am that torn in two.\\' \\n\\n\\'Poor Sam! It will feel like that, I am afraid,\\' said Frodo. \\'But you \\nwill be healed. You were meant to be solid and whole, and you will be.\\' \\n\\nIn the next day or two Frodo went through his papers and his writings \\nwith Sam, and he handed over his keys. There was a big book with plain red \\nleather covers; its tall pages were now almost filled. At the beginning \\nthere were many leaves covered with Bilbo\\'s thin wandering hand; but most of \\nit was written in Frodo\\'s firm flowing script. It was divided into chapters \\nbut Chapter 80 was unfinished, and after that were some blank leaves. The \\ntitle page had many titles on it, crossed out one after another, so: \\n\\nMy Diary. My Unexpected Journey. There and Back Again. And What \\nHappened After. \\n\\nAdventures of Five Hobbits. The Tale of the Great Ring, compiled by \\nBilbo Baggins from his own observations and the accounts of his friends . \\nWhat we did in the War of the Ring. \\n\\nHere Bilbo\\'s hand ended and Frodo had written: \\n\\nTHE DOWNFALL \\n\\nOF THE \\n\\nLORD OF THE RINGS \\n\\nAND THE \\n\\nRETURN OF THE KING \\n\\n\\n\\n(as seen by the Little People; being the memoirs of Bilbo and Frodo of \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe Shire, supplemented by the accounts of their friends and the learning of \\nthe Wise.) \\n\\nTogether with extracts from Books of Lore translated by Bilbo in \\nRivendell. \\n\\n\\'Why, you have nearly finished it, Mr. Frodo!\\' Sam exclaimed. \\'Well, \\nyou have kept at it, I must say.\\' \\n\\n\\'I have quite finished, Sam,\\' said Frodo. \\'The last pages are for you.\\' \\n\\nOn September the twenty-first they set out together, Frodo on the pony \\nthat had borne him all the way from Minas Tirith, and was now called \\nStrider; and Sam on his beloved Bill. It was a fair golden morning, and Sam \\ndid not ask where they were going: he thought he could guess. \\n\\nThey took the Stock Road over the hills and went towards the Woody End, \\nand they let their ponies walk at their leisure. They camped in the Green \\nHills, and on September the twenty-second they rode gently down into the \\nbeginning of the trees as afternoon was wearing away. \\n\\n\\'If that isn\\'t the very tree you hid behind when the Black Rider first \\nshowed up, Mr. Frodo!\\' said Sam pointing to the left. \\'It seems like a dream \\nnow.\\' \\n\\nIt was evening, and the stars were glimmering in the eastern sky as \\nthey passed the ruined oak and turned and went on down the hill between the \\nhazel -thickets. Sam was silent, deep in his memories. Presently he became \\naware that Frodo was singing softly to himself, singing the old \\nwalking-song, but the words were not quite the same. \\n\\nStill round the corner there may wait \\nAnew road or a secret gate; \\n\\nAnd though I oft have passed them by, \\n\\nA day will come at last when I \\nShall take the hidden paths that run \\nWest of the Moon, East of the Sun. \\n\\nAnd as if in answer, from down below, coming up the road out of the \\nvalley, voices sang: \\n\\nA! Elbereth Gilthoniel! \\nsilivren penna mnriel \\no menel aglar elenath, \\n\\nGilthoniel, A! Elbereth! \\n\\nWe still remember, we who dwell \\nIn this far land beneath the trees \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe starlight on the Western Seas. \\n\\nFrodo and Sam halted and sat silent in the soft shadows, until they saw \\na shimmer as the travellers came towards them. \\n\\nThere was Gildor and many fair Elven folk; and there to Sam\\'s wonder \\nrode Elrond and Galadriel. Elrond wore a mantle of grey and had a star upon \\nhis forehead, and a silver harp was in his hand, and upon his finger was a \\nring of gold with a great blue stone, Vilya, mightiest of the Three. But \\nGaladriel sat upon a white palfrey and was robed all in glimmering white, \\nlike clouds about the Moon; for she herself seemed to shine with a soft \\nlight. On her finger was Nenya, the ring wrought of mithril, that bore a \\nsingle white stone flickering like a frosty star. Riding slowly behind on a \\nsmall grey pony, and seeming to nod in his sleep, was Bilbo himself. \\n\\nElrond greeted them gravely and graciously, and Galadriel smiled upon \\nthem. \\'Well, Master Samwise,\\' she said. \\'I hear and see that you have used \\nmy gift well. The Shire shall now be more than ever blessed and beloved.\\' \\nSam bowed, but found nothing to say. Ele had forgotten how beautiful the Lady \\nwas. \\n\\nThen Bilbo woke up and opened his eyes. \\'Hullo, Frodo!\\' he said. \\'Well, \\n\\nI have passed the Old Took today! So that\\'s settled. And now I think I am \\nquite ready to go on another journey. Are you coming?\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes, I am coming,\\' said Frodo. \\'The Ring -bearers should go together.\\' \\n\\n\\'Where are you going, Master?\\' cried Sam, though at last he understood \\nwhat was happening. \\n\\n\\'To the Havens, Sam,\\' said Frodo. \\n\\n\\'And I can\\'t come.\\' \\n\\n\\'No, Sam. Not yet anyway, not further than the Havens. Though you too \\nwere a Ring -bearer, if only for a little while. Your time may come. Do not \\nbe too sad, Sam. You cannot be always torn in two. You will have to be one \\nand whole, for many years. You have so much to enjoy and to be, and to do.\\' \\n\\n\\'But,\\' said Sam, and tears started in his eyes, \\'I thought you were \\ngoing to enjoy the Shire, too. for years and years, after all you have \\ndone.\\' \\n\\n\\'So I thought too, once. But I have been too deeply hurt, Sam. I tried \\nto save the Shire, and it has been saved, but not for me. It must often be \\nso, Sam, when things are in danger: some one has to give them up, lose them, \\nso that others may keep them. But you are my heir: all that I had and might \\nhave had I leave to you. And also you have Rose, and Elanor; and Frodo-lad \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwill come, and Rosie-lass, and Merry, and Goldilocks, and Pippin; and \\nperhaps more that I cannot see. Your hands and your wits will be needed \\neverywhere. You will be the Mayor, of course, as long as you want to be, and \\nthe most famous gardener in history; and you will read things out of the Red \\nBook, and keep alive the memory of the age that is gone, so that people will \\nremember the Great Danger and so love their beloved land all the more. And \\nthat will keep you as busy and as happy as anyone can be, as long as your \\npart of the Story goes on. \\n\\n\\'Come now, ride with me!\\' \\n\\nThen Elrond and Galadriel rode on; for the Third Age was over, and the \\nDays of the Rings were passed, and an end was come of the story and song of \\nthose times. With them went many Elves of the High Kindred who would \\nno \\n\\nlonger stay in Middle-earth; and among them, filled with a sadness that was \\nyet blessed and without bitterness, rode Sam, and Frodo, and Bilbo, and the \\nElves delighted to honour them. \\n\\nThough they rode through the midst of the Shire all the evening and all \\nthe night, none saw them pass, save the wild creatures; or here and there \\nsome wanderer in the dark who saw a swift shimmer under the trees, or a \\nlight and shadow flowing through the grass as the Moon went westward. And \\nwhen they had passed from the Shire, going about the south skirts of the \\nWhite Downs, they came to the Far Downs, and to the Towers, and looked on \\nthe distant Sea; and so they rode down at last to Mithlond, to the Grey \\nHavens in the long firth of Lune. \\n\\nAs they came to the gates Cnrdan the Shipwright came forth to greet \\nthem. Very tall he was, and his beard was long, and he was grey and old, \\nsave that his eyes were keen as stars; and he looked at them and bowed, and \\nsaid: \\'All is now ready.\\' \\n\\nThen Cnrdan led them to the Havens, and there was a white ship lying, \\nand upon the quay beside a great grey horse stood a figure robed all in \\nwhite awaiting them. As he turned and came towards them Frodo saw that \\nGandalf now wore openly upon his hand the Third Ring, Nary a the Great, and \\nthe stone upon it was red as fire. Then those who were to go were glad, for \\nthey knew that Gandalf also would take ship with them. \\n\\nBut Sam was now sorrowful at heart, and it seemed to him that if the \\nparting would be bitter, more grievous still would be the long road home \\nalone. But even as they stood there, and the Elves were going aboard, and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nall was being made ready to depart, up rode Merry and Pippin in great haste. \\nAnd amid his tears Pippin laughed. \\n\\n\\'You tried to give us the slip once before and failed, Frodo.\\' he said. \\n\\nThis time you have nearly succeeded, but you have failed again. It was not \\nSam, though, that gave you away this time, but Gandalf himself!\\' \\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Gandalf; \\'for it will be better to ride back three together \\n\\'than one alone. Well, here at last, dear friends, on the shores of the Sea \\ncomes the end of our fellowship in Middle-earth. Go in peace! I will not \\nsay: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.\\' \\n\\nThen Frodo kissed Merry and Pippin, and last of all Sam, and went \\naboard; and the sails were drawn up, and the wind blew, and slowly the ship \\nslipped away down the long grey firth; and the light of the glass of \\nGaladriel that Frodo bore glimmered and was lost. And the ship went out into \\nthe High Sea and passed on into the West, until at last on a night of rain \\nFrodo smelled a sweet fragrance on the air and heard the sound of singing \\nthat came over the water. And then it seemed to him that as in his dream in \\nthe house of Bombadil, the grey rain-curtain turned all to silver glass and \\nwas rolled back, and he beheld white shores and beyond them a far green \\ncountry under a swift sunrise. \\n\\nBut to Sam the evening deepened to darkness as he stood at the Haven; \\nand as he looked at the grey sea he saw only a shadow on the waters that was \\nsoon lost in the West. There still he stood far into the night, hearing only \\nthe sigh and murmur of the waves on the shores of Middle-earth, and the \\nsound of them sank deep into his heart. Beside him stood Merry and Pippin, \\nand they were silent. \\n\\nAt last the three companions turned away, and never again looking back \\nthey rode slowly homewards; and they spoke no word to one another until they \\ncame back to the Shire, but each had great comfort in his friends on the \\nlong grey road. \\n\\nAt last they rode over the downs and took the East Road, and then Merry \\nand Pippin rode on to Buckland; and already they were singing again as they \\nwent. But Sam turned to Bywater, and so came back up the Hill, as day was \\nending once more. And he went on, and there was yellow light, and fire \\nwithin; and the evening meal was ready, and he was expected. And Rose drew \\nhim in, and set him in his chair, and put little Elanor upon his lap. \\n\\nHe drew a deep breath. \\'Well, I\\'m back,\\' he said. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1 As the records of Gondor relate this was Argeleb II, the twentieth of \\nthe Northern line, which came to an end with Arvedui three hundred years \\nlater. \\n\\n2 Thus, the years of the Third Age in the reckoning of the Elves and \\nthe D(r)nedain may be found by adding 1600 to the dates of Shire-reckoning. \\n\\n1 See Appendix B: annals 1451, 1462, 1482; and note at end of Appendix \\nC. \\n\\n1 Represented in much reduced form in Appendix B as far as the end of \\nthe Third Age. \\n\\n* See note, III 490. \\n\\n* Elves (and Hobbits) always refer to the Sun as She. \\n\\n* The Brandywine River \\n\\n* See Note in Appendix F: Of the Elves. \\n\\n1 See Appendix F under Ents \\n\\n1 Every month in the Shire-calendar had 30 days. \\n\\n1 See App. F, 520. \\n\\n( There were thirty days in March (or Rethe) in the Shire calendar. \\n\\n( It was probably Orkish in origin: sharky, \\'old man\\'. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"
